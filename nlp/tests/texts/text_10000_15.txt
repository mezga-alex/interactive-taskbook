to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients ' money .
Alarmed state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners .
Industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards too they 're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine .
But reform has n't taken hold yet .
The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days says Scott Stapf director of investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Association .
An admittedly limited survey by NASAA whose members are state securities-law regulators found that between 1986 and 1988 fraud and abuse by financial planners cost 22,000 investors 400 million .
The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons a compulsive gambler or two various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother .
What 's more the losses they and the others caused are just what we are stumbling over says Mr. Stapf adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected .
So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners .
Nobody can estimate the toll but John Gargan a Tampa Fla. planner and head of one trade group the International Association of Registered Financial Planners thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is humongous far greater than that from crookery .
His group like others wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners .
Surveying all this some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all .
For most investors the benefits just are n't worth the risks says Barbara Roper who follows financial-planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America a consumer-advocacy organization based in Washington .
She concedes that such a position is unfair to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it .
She says her group used to give tips on selecting planners check educational and experience credentials consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus but found that even some people who took these steps were still getting ripped off .
The bad news however has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning .
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business .
But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners IAFP the industry 's biggest trade group is still nearly triple what it was in 1980 and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well .
An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners and the pool of capital they influence is enormous .
A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months .
The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult if not impossible to regulate .
Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as investment advisers people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity .
The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers about the same as in 1980 even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade .
Currently a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years .
A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years .
It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem says Kathryn McGrath director of the SEC 's division of investment management .
So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers which operates in the brokerage business .
Such an organization could among other things set minimum standards for competence ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules .
The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with .
Mr. Schwartz the puckish planner from Englewood Colo. says that allowing the business to police itself would be like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank .
Mr. Gargan the Tampa planner who heads one trade group favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff .
Mr. Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP the major industry organization .
When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners Mr. Gargan 's group was excluded .
That may be because Mr. Gargan smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group enrolled his dog Beauregard as a member of the IAFP .
Then he sent the pooch 's picture with the certificate of membership it was made out to Boris Bo Regaard to every newspaper he could think of .
The states have their own ideas about regulation and certification .
NASAA the organization of state securities regulators is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states .
It requires financial planners to register with states pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest .
The most common conflict involves compensation .
NASAA estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they recommend .
The issue Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments or the ones that garner the biggest commissions .
In 1986 the New York attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp. an Albany financial-planning firm that had invested 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors .
In its notice of action the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into balanced investment portfolios instead the attorney general alleged the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings coins and Florida condos .
Those investments paid big commissions to First Meridian payments investors were never told about the attorney general alleged .
Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted .
In practice the attorney general alleged in an affidavit if an investor had access to cash the chances of being turned down by First Meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month Club .
And the attorney general added First Meridian 's president Roger V. Sala portrayed himself as a financial expert when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma work as a real-estate and insurance salesman and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth .
First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general .
Harry Manion Mr. Sala 's attorney says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general 's contentions about First Meridian 's business practices are incorrect .
As for Mr. Sala 's qualifications the snooty attorneys for the state of New York decided Mr. Sala was n't qualified because he did n't have a Harvard degree says Mr. Manion .
Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common .
Two such actions both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta could be particularly embarrassing to the industry both name J. Chandler Peterson an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP as defendant .
One suit filed by more than three dozen investors charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest .
Those companies in turn paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees the suit alleges .
The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale Ariz .
One plaintiff a doctor testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician the privilege of making additional investments with Mr. Peterson .
In affidavits each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned .
Mr. Peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors .
Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots he opened up his briefcase and dumped 1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors says Myron Diebel the bank 's president .
He said he wanted to show the color of his money recalls Mr. Diebel .
Bank officials however showed him the door and the sale never came off .
According to the suit Mr. Peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment .
They want it back .
Mr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits saying he prefers to save such responses for court .
But he does say that all of his activities have been entirely proper .
On the suit by the limited partners he says he is considering a defamation suit against t
