 statist countries .
Having said that we must caution against an apparent tendency to overstate the case .
It is not quite true for example that the Mexican government has privatized Mexicana de Aviacion as Mr. Ortiz claims .
In the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40 % of the total equity of the airline .
How can a company be considered privatized if the state is so heavily represented in it .
True the Mexican government has granted control over the airline to a new private consortium but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine .
Regrettably too Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar numbers game when he boasts that fewer than 392 state enterprises currently remain in the public sector down from the 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982 .
But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico indeed they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure .
I refer essentially to petroleum electric power banking and newsprint .
Those enterprises however are not going to be privatized .
They are officially considered strategic and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution .
In language that sidesteps the issue Mr. Ortiz writes The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas 's plan to modernize Mexico 's economy .
Yet clearly modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said to have caught the privatization bug .
The bottom line however is not economic but political reform .
A long succession of Mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to without having to answer to the public .
To guarantee that Mexicana de Aviacion and other companies will really be privatized Mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability .

A labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands according to people familiar with the group .
The group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of 225 to 240 a share or 5.09 billion to 5.42 billion .
But to avoid the risk of rejection the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a UAL board meeting today .
Instead the group is raising the proposal informally to try to test the board 's reaction .
People familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the 300-a-share 6.79 billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner British Airways PLC dropped out .
In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange UAL closed at 168.50 a share down 21.625 .
But the pilots union which has been pushing for a takeover since 1987 appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner to replace British Air .
Although the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks it believes bank financing could be obtained .
After the collapse of the last effort the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without binding commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed .
Under the type of transaction being discussed the pilot-management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders .
Those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company .
For example the group could offer 200 a share in cash plus stock valued at 30 a share .
UAL currently has 22.6 million shares fully diluted .
The new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest .
The difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control .
The failed takeover would have given UAL employees 75 % voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline with management getting 10 % control and British Air 15 % .
It was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan but employees would keep more than 50 % .
Management 's total could be reduced and the public could get more than the 15 % control that had been earmarked for British Air .
One option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period .
Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort at least temporarily and to return to running the company full time .
The board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale .
The labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board .
However the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis who triggered the buy-out with a 5.4 billion bid in early August is hanging back apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse .
Three top advisers to Mr. Davis visited New York late last week at least in part to confer with executives at Citicorp .
Mr. Davis had paid 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid .
But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group .
On Friday British Air issued a statement saying it does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future .
However several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out .
Also late last week UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer .
But the machinists union whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor .
One advantage the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make 200 million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid .
Speculation has also arisen that the UAL executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing chief financial officer John Pope may come under pressure to resign .
However people familiar with the buy-out group said Mr. Pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time .
Despite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing UAL remains obligated to pay 26.7 million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers Lazard Freres & Co. Salomon Brothers Inc. and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .

A REVISED BID FOR UAL is being prepared by a labor-management group sources said .
The new proposal which would transfer majority ownership of United Air 's parent to employees and leave some stock in public hands would be valued at 225 to 240 a share or as much as 5.42 billion .

The Food and Drug Administration said American Home Products Corp. agreed to recall certain generic drugs that were produced by its Quantum Pharmics unit in Amityville N.Y .
Quantum stopped shipping the drugs last month following a federal investigation regarding information the company supplied to obtain three drug approvals .

Lyondell Petrochemical Co. said third-quarter net income fell 54 % to 73 million or 91 cents a share from 160 million a year earlier .
Year-earlier per-share results are n't applicable because the company went public in January .
Revenue rose 7.7 % to 1.28 billion from 1.18 billion .
The petrochemical maker said the biggest reason earnings declined was a loss of production time and the increased costs associated with a temporary maintenance closing and expansion of an olefins plant .
Like other refiners Lyondell 's margins for chemicals and gasoline were narrower .
While the company said chemical margins continued to worsen this quarter costs will be lower because the maintenance and expansions are complete .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday Lyondell was unchanged at 18.50 a share .

In East Germany where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism they 're not laughing about their new leader Egon Krenz .
Mr. Krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him .
You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes says an East German mother of two who loves swapping political barbs with her friends .
With Krenz we just do n't know what to expect .
Mr. Krenz does n't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old Politburo member was selected last week to succeed Erich Honecker .
But he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either .
According to East Germany 's ADN news agency Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged East Germany could learn from Moscow 's glasnost policies .
Already last week Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media .
On Thursday a day after he took office East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer .
The regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet-style glasnost .
It was quite a shock says a 43-year-old East German shopkeeper .
For the first time in my life I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television .
Other changes including easing restrictions on travel for East Germans are expected .
But whether such moves can win back the confidence of East Germans who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes depends largely on whether they feel they can trust Mr. Krenz .
And that 's a problem .
Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor Mr. Honecker but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators .
I hope he grows with the job says Rainer Eppelmann a Protestant pastor in East Berlin .
The most important thing is that he have
