vious company .
But going against the grain has never bothered Mr. Andersson .
Stroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview the diminutive Swede quips It turned out to be lucky for us .
If the whole market thinks what you 're doing is crazy you do n't have much competition .
Mr. Andersson is anxious to strengthen Trelleborg 's balance sheet .
Characteristically he did n't waste much time getting started .
On Tuesday Trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions minerals processing and building and distribution as separately quoted companies on Stockholm 's Stock Exchange .
At current market prices the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor 386 million to Trelleborg 's coffers analysts say .
The board had also been expected to approve a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares .
But that share issue intended to make Trelleborg better known among international investors was postponed until market conditions stabilize people familiar with the situation say .
Trelleborg 's internationally traded Bfree series stock plunged SKr29 4.48 to SKr205 31.65 in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm .
Tuesday the shares regained SKr20 closing at SKr225 .
Mr. Andersson says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help erase the conglomerate stigma that has held down Trelleborg 's share price .
Trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50 % of both units .
The spinoff should solve a problem for the parent .
A family foundation set up by late founder Henry Dunker controls 59 % of Trelleborg 's voting shares outstanding .
But the foundation bylaws require the entire Trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below 50 % .
That possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance Trelleborg 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding .
That growth is the result of Mr. Andersson 's shopping spree during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years .
Most of the new additions were barely profitable if not outright loss makers .
Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker AB Electrolux Mr. Andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood and got quick results .
The treatment turned Trelleborg into one of Scandinavia 's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns .
Between 1985 and 1988 sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold .
Many analysts expect Mr. Andersson who owns 1.7 % of the company to be named Trelleborg 's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year .
But the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style Mr. Andersson describes as being the driving force leading the troops not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for people to bring me ideas .
Last month in his boldest move yet Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern Falconbridge Ltd .
Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern .
Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. says Mike Kurtanjek a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. London .
But we certainly like what we 've seen so far .
But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles .
Mr. Andersson acknowledges that the company 's mining division will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion .
Booming metals prices have fueled Trelleborg 's recent profit surge raising mining 's share of pretax profit to 68 % this year from a big loss two years earlier .
But analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth .
Mining is likely to remain Trelleborg 's main business .
Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture .
Noranda and Trelleborg each came close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid .
Some analysts say Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge and that the Swedes relatively inexperienced in international mining operations could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf .
Mr. Andersson insists that Trelleborg and Noranda have n't discussed a Falconbridge break-up .
Falconbridge he says will continue operating in its current form .
We 'd be reluctant to accept ownership in a manufacturing company .
But such partnerships are common in mining where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner Trelleborg 's president says .
Perhaps more important both companies share Mr. Andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries .
If the 1980s were a decade of consumption the 90s will be the investment decade Mr. Andersson says .
The whole of Europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment he says .
That 's beginning to change .
And investment is the key word for base metals and most other businesses Trelleborg is in .
Apple Computer Inc. posted improved fiscal fourth-quarter profit due largely to a 48 million gain on the sale of its stock in Adobe Systems Inc .

John Sculley chairman and chief executive officer credited the Macintosh SE\/30 and IIcx computers introduced in the winter for the brightened sales performance .
Mr. Sculley also indicated that sagging margins which dogged the company through most of 1989 began to turn up in the fourth quarter as chip prices eased .
Adverse pressure on gross margins has subsided Mr. Sculley said .
Margins in the fiscal fourth quarter perked up rising to 51 % from 49.2 % a year earlier .
For all of fiscal 1989 however the average gross margin was 49 % below the average 1988 gross margin of 51 % .
Lower component costs especially for DRAMs or dynamic random access memory chips were cited for the easing of margin pressure on the company a spokeswoman said .
Looking ahead to 1990 Mr. Sculley predicted another year of significant revenue growth along with improved profitability as the recovery in gross margins continues into 1990 .

Please submit your offers says Felipe Bince Jr .
He surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the Philippine government 's Asset Privatization Trust for the sale of a 36 % interest in the country 's largest paper mill .
The agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than 80 million .
Not a peso is offered .
Mr. Bince the trust 's associate executive trustee declares the bidding a failure .
It 's getting harder to sell he mutters as he leaves the room .
Indeed .
Recently the trust failed to auction off the paper mill a bank an office building and a small cotton-ginning plant .
Of the four only the bank and the plant drew bids one apiece .
In October 1987 President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would get out of business by selling all or part of the state 's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos .
Two years later Mrs. Aquino 's promise remains largely unfulfilled .
October is a critical month for the privatization program .
Manila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged .
In addition the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines the national carrier an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls the bellwether of privatization .
All told there are assets on the line valued at up to 1.03 billion .
The privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds .
Much of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion-dollar agrarian-reform program .
But efforts have been thwarted by official indifference bureaucratic resistance a legal system that operates at a snail 's pace political opposition and government misjudgments .
Most recently a lack of buyers has been added to the list .
Rather than gathering momentum the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets .
The axiom appears to be that the more valuable the asset the harder the privatization process .
You just do n't see a whole lot happening says an international economist .
To be sure the program has n't completely stalled .
The Asset Privatization Trust the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties has recorded sales of more than 500 million since it began functioning in December 1986 .
But its success has been largely in the sale of small nonperforming companies which are valued for their assets .
Dealing with the sales this month could be particularly challenging because almost every problem that has hobbled the program in the past is popping up again .
Ramon Garcia the Asset Trust 's executive trustee admits to what he calls temporary setbacks .
In light of the poor results recently he says the agency is adopting an attitude of flexibility .
October 's troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank Associated Bank for the minimum price of 671 million pesos 31 million .
At the end of the month the agency again will offer the bank .
But instead of a minimum price only a target price will be established .
Bankers say however that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price .
The bank has a negative net worth they say .
In addition special bidding rules give the bank 's former owner Leonardo Ty the right to match the highest bid .
Mr. Ty lost control to the government in 1980 when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash-strapped institution .
In 1983 the loans were converted into equity giving Manila 98 % of the bank but with the understanding that Mr. Ty had repurchase rights .
His ability to match any bid has scared off many potential buyers .
Separately the government will try again within a month to sell the 36 % stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines or Picop as the paper mill is known .
The price will depend on how much Picop shares fetch on the local stock market .
But according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill price is n't the only consideration .
As it stands now the government would continue to hold 45 % of Picop after the 36 % stake is sold .
About 7.5 % of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity .
Potential buyers mostly foreign companies are reluctant to take a non-controlling stake in a company that by the government 's own reckoning needs some 100 million in new capital for rehabilitation .
The prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers including a member of the Elders group of Australia to pull out of the bidding the bankers and analysts say .
Mr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer .
Under government regulations however foreign ownership of Picop 's equity is limited to 40 % .
Even though the government would retain the 45 % stake in Picop critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners .
A series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short-changing the government over the Picop sale .
Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale both prompted by the criticism of the agency .
The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines in which it has a 99 % stake .
The carrier has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed .
This maker of electronic measuring devices named two new directors increasing board membership to nine .
The new directors are Gordon M. Sprenger president and chief executive officer of LifeSpan Inc. and Peter S. Willmott chairman and chief executive officer of Willmott Services Inc .

Eagle Financial Corp. and Webster Financial Corp. two Connecticut savings bank-holding companies agreed to merge in a tax-free stock transaction .
The new holding company Webster\/Eagle Bancorp Inc. will have about 1.2 billion of assets and 19 banking offices in Connecticut .
Tangible capital will be about 115 million .
The merger is subject to regulatory clearance and a definitive agreement .
In the merger each share of Webster based in Waterbury will be converted into one share of the new company .
Each share of Eagle based in Bristol will become 0.95 share of Webster\/Eagle .
In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday Eagle shares rose 12.5 cents to 11 .
In national over-the-counter trading Webster shares fell 25 cents to 12.375 .
Webster has 3.5 million shares outstanding and Eagle 2.6 million .
Their indicated market values thus are about 43.3 million and 28.6 million respectively .
Frank J. Pascale chairman of Eagle will be chairman of the new firm and James C. Smith president and chief executive officer of Webster will take those posts at Webster\/Eagle .
Harold W. Smith Sr. chairman of Webster will become chairman emeritus and a director of the new company .
Ralph T. Linsley vice chairman of Eagle will become vice chairman of Webster\/Eagle .
The board will be made up of seven directors of each holding company .
In an interview James Smith said the banks ' markets are contiguous and their business philosophies are similar and conservative .
Nonperforming loans will make up only about 0.5 % of the combined banks ' total loans outstanding he said .
At June 30 Webster which owns First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Waterbury had assets of 699 million .
Eagle which controls Bristol Federal Savings Bank and First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Torrington had assets of 469.6 million on that date .
Guillermo Ortiz 's Sept. 15 Americas column Mexico 's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug is a refreshingly clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well .
