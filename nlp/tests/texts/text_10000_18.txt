Now television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny .
The IRS recently won part of its long-running battle with the Church of Scientology over exemptions when the U.S. Supreme Court held that members ' payments to the church were n't deductible because the members received services in return .
IRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers entertainment producers masons roofers and taxi owners .
Small businesses in general account for almost 40 % of unreported personal income the IRS has said .
Once such abuses become so pervasive the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them .
San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula not because IRS agents envy their life styles .
Many openings for mass cheating such as questionable tax shelters and home offices have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them .
Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals .
And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers .
Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony who gets a deduction must report the former spouse 's Social Security number .
Passport applicants now must give Social Security numbers enabling the IRS to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns .
But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention .
In most cases the IRS says these projects are local or regional rather than national and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among say factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses .
The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects according to Marshall V. Washburn deputy assistant commissioner for examination .
Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail but they can make life miserable in other ways for one by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence failure to file a return and the like .
The targeted audit groups include direct sellers people who sell cosmetics housewares and other items door to door or at home parties and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes .
Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips people who engage in large cash transactions and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax .
And now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return and which dependents turn out to be deceased .
Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back .
It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs Mr. Washburn says .
The study provided criteria for singling out returns of potentially noncompliant taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part-time business .
The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill N.J. who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields .
For 1984 they reported gross income of 1,647 from Amway sales offset by expenses totaling 16,746 including car costs of 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of 5,088 .
The Tax Court did n't believe that the Rubins who earned 65,619 in their regular jobs treated the sideline as a real business and derived merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits from it .
The Direct Selling Association a trade group points out that its members which include Amway Corp. cooperate with the IRS to distribute tax-compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject .
The independent-contractor project which began in 1988 involves about 350 IRS agents .
In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 reports Raymond P. Keenan assistant commissioner for collection they examined about 13,000 employers assessed more than 67 million in delinquent employment taxes and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors .
The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions mostly paid by small firms .
Many workers especially professionals want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees ca n't .
But many others who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation become tipsters for the IRS says Jerry Lackey who manages the IRS project 's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando .
Firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't he says .
In his area Mr. Lackey continues the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction doing framing drywall masonry and similar work .
But a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them including physicians and receptionists as independent contractors .
The IRS assessed the clinic 350,000 in back payroll taxes .
It assessed nearly 500,000 against a cruise-ship company that carried about 100 deckhands cooks bartenders entertainers and other employees as self-employed independents .
Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an 80 million computer system in 1985 .
The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses from exchange agreements with the IRS 24 other states and two Canadian provinces and even from phonebook Yellow Pages .
Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer they single out high-income groups looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns .
The state has combed through records relating to architects stockbrokers lawyers in the New York City area construction workers from out of the state and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states especially Florida which has no personal income tax .
Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state doctors dentists and accountants says Frederick G. Hicks director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs .
The department has collected over 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution .
In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns it squeezed 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident .
We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project Mr. Hicks declares .

In finding good news in Berkeley 's new freshman admissions plan The Privileged Class editorial Sept. 20 you 're reading the headline but not the story .
The plan indeed raises from 40 % to 50 % the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria .
But that does n't mean half of the students attending Berkeley will be admitted this way .
The plan is talking about applicants admitted not students who enroll .
Since the yield from this top slice of applicants is relatively low boosting admits from 40 % to 50 % will boost registrants from about 31 % to 38 % of the class .
In addition perhaps 5 % of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials narrowly missed gaining them admission in the first category .
But against that combined increase of 12 % in students chosen by academic criteria the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades test scores and supplemental points for factors such as high-school curriculum English-language proficiency and an essay .
This category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of registrants .
The plan thus will decrease by 22 % for a net loss of 10 % the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria .
Who will take over these places .
The plan creates a new category of students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds a concept not yet defined and gives them about 10 % of the class .
One of the plan 's authors has defended the socioeconomic disadvantage category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race .
Perhaps it does .
But the new category does not replace or reduce Berkeley 's broad racial preferences .
Nor will students from racial-minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative-action target for their group .
The plan thus places a large new affirmative-action program based on socioeconomic disadvantage on top of the existing program based on race .
The role of academic criteria in choosing Berkeley 's freshmen can only decline as a result .
