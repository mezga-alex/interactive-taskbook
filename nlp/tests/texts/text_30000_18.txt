omb says each of his computers can produce and send about 75 unique newsletters a night .
Many computer network users who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically .
So-called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos gossip technical data schedules and directives distributed over local and national computer networks .
All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what 's junk and what 's important says Chuck Digate a former Lotus Development executive who has started a new company to cope with the problem .
Mr. Digate says his firm Beyond Inc. has licensed technology known as Information Lens from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and plans to develop it for commercial use .
The MIT project devised ways for E-mail to be automatically categorized as top priority if it comes from certain designated senders or requires action in the next couple of days .
Mr. Digate says that Beyond will refine the product so the message will be smart enough to know to come back and bother you again next week .
And if a user is busy he can set it for crisis mode Do n't bother me with reports until Monday .
A program called Notes which is under development by Lotus also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work groups .
One thing that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same .
Notes which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail .
A daily news briefing from the company librarian for example would have a distinctive format on the screen just as a paper version would have .
With E-mail you do n't have the visual clues of paper says Mr. Tarter the editor of SoftLetter .
With Notes they 're visually distinct .
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. lost its second recent arbitration case involving a former bond-trading executive .
A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel ordered Dean Witter to pay 404,294 in back bonuses to William Kelly the company 's former head of high-yield high-risk junk-bond trading and sales .
It also awarded 196,785 in back bonuses to former trader Michael Newcomb and 69,105 in fees to the two men 's attorneys .
The sums awarded to Messrs. Kelly and Newcomb represent bonuses the two men said they deserved from the first half of 1988 but which were n't paid because of a dispute over an incentive contract .
Jeffrey L. Liddle the two men 's attorney at Liddle O'Connor Finkelstein & Robinson said Mr. Kelly began working at Dean Witter in 1987 .
Mr. Kelly built the company 's high-yield bond group which has been a minor player in the junk-bond arena .
Dean Witter lost a separate case involving a former bond executive earlier this year in August it paid 666,666 in back pay and a bonus to a former corporate-bond trading chief Harold Bachman .
That award ended a dispute between Dean Witter and Mr. Bachman over who was responsible for certain bond-trading losses around the time of the 1987 stock-market crash .
A spokesman for Dean Witter a unit of Sears Roebuck & Co. declined to comment .

WASHINGTON LIES LOW after the stock market 's roller-coaster ride .
Lawmakers haunted by charges that some of their comments contributed to the 1987 crash generally shy away from calls for sweeping new legislation .
But a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee will quiz SEC Chairman Breeden Wednesday and Treasury Secretary Brady will go before the Senate Banking panel Thursday .
The market 's wild week may speed along the market-reform legislation that has been pending for months in the aftermath of the 1987 crash .
It may also expedite the SEC 's modest pending changes in junk-bond disclosure rules and intensify the Treasury 's look at plans for giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short-term trades by pension funds .
Brady and Breeden work well together on the plunge despite the fact that the Treasury secretary opposed Breeden 's nomination to the SEC post .

Ever since the hotly contested America 's Cup race last year the famous yachting match has run into more rough sailing out of the water than in it .
Now that a key member of the San Diego Yacht Club team is splitting off to form his own team even more competition lies ahead .
Peter Isler the winning navigator in the past two America 's Cup challenges has split from the team led by Dennis Conner skipper of the victorious Stars & Stripes to form his own team for the next contest in 1992 .
And in addition to a crack team of sailors Mr. Isler has lined up some real brass to help him finance the syndicate .
Isler Sailing International 's advisory board includes Ted Turner Turner Broadcasting chairman and a former Cup victor Peter G. Diamandis head of Diamandis Communications and Joseph B. Vittoria chairman and chief executive of Avis Inc .
His steering committee includes other notable businessmen including the California investor and old salt Roy E. Disney .
We have the structure people and plan Mr. Isler said in a statement .
Now the first order of business is raising enough money to keep his team afloat a new yacht will cost about 3 million alone and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to 25 million for a Cup challenge .
The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the San Diego Yacht Club should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the New Zealand challengers ' 90-foot monohull .
In September a New York appellate court overturned a state judge 's ruling that awarded the Cup to the New Zealand team .
Pending an appeal by the New Zealand team led by Michael Fay the finals for the next Cup challenge are scheduled to be held in mid-1992 in San Diego .
But because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the suit Mr. Conner 's team has done little to begin gearing up to defend its title .
If you do n't know what the rules of the game are it 's hard to start your fund-raising or design said Dana Smith an official with Team Dennis Conner .
The Conner team wo n't be able to negotiate with corporate sponsors until the suit is resolved and the race site is determined Mr. Smith said and the syndicate 's budget could easily reach 30 million .
But spokesmen for both Mr. Isler and Mr. Conner say the formation of the new syndicate has to do with Mr. Isler 's desire to skipper his own team and begin planning now rather than any falling out between the two sportsmen .
Mr. Smith and a spokesman for the America 's Cup Organizing Committee insist that the added competition for the defender 's spot will only improve the race .
Missouri farmer Blake Hurst writing in the fall issue of the Heritage Foundation 's Policy Review about the proposed location of a hazardous-waste incinerator in his county Of course I 'd rather have a computer software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator .
But I 'd also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms I 've seen and smelt in these parts .
An incinerator is also probably better than having nobody next door on our farm there are four unoccupied houses .
On my four-mile drive to farm headquarters each morning I drive by another four empty houses .
A community of abandoned farmsteads failing businesses and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one .
The loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural Missouri is hardly of national importance except for this If the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem can not be built in Atchinson County what hope have we for dealing with the wastes our economy produces .
After all farmers here work with hazardous chemicals every day many of them the same chemicals that would have been destroyed in the incinerator .
We know they are dangerous but if handled with care their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment .
Just because Stamford Conn. High School did nothing when its valuable 1930s mural was thrown in the trash does n't mean the city no longer owns the work of art a federal judge ruled .
The mural now valued at 1.3 million according to appraisers was tossed in a trash heap in 1971 by workers who were renovating the building .
The 100-foot-long mural painted by James Daugherty in 1934 was commissioned by the federal Works Project Administration .
After the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned Stamford graduate it eventually was turned over to Hiram Hoelzer a professional art restorer .
Throughout the 1970s Stamford school and city officials made no effort to locate the mural .
Apparently the officials did n't even know the mural was missing until 1980 when a researcher found that the painting was in Mr. Hoelzer 's studio and questioned school officials about it .
In 1986 Stamford officials thanked Mr. Hoelzer for taking care of the mural and demanded he return it as soon as possible .
Mr. Hoelzer however sued Stamford claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long to reclaim it .
But Judge Louis L. Stanton of federal court in Manhattan ruled that the city could n't be faulted for waiting too long because it did n't realize until 1986 that its ownership of the painting was in dispute .
The judge also ruled that the painting was n't abandoned because officials did n't intend for it to be thrown away and were unaware that the workmen had discarded it .
Mr. Hoelzer did n't return phone calls seeking comment on the judge 's decision .
The judge ordered that a hearing be held Nov. 17 to determine how much the city should pay Mr. Hoelzer for his services .
Mary E. Sommer corporate counsel for Stamford said the city has discussed several possible plans for displaying the mural which portrays various scenes from the Great Depression .
She said the mural preserves an era in Stamford and in our country when this type of work was being done .
The prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the Soviet Union is keeping up its dizzying October buying binge of U.S. corn .
Those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the U.S. Agriculture Department announced that the Soviets had bought 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn bringing their U.S. corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons .
In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade the corn contract for December delivery jumped 5.75 cents a bushel to settle at 2.44 a bushel .
The Soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected the Soviet Union to buy this fall the season in which it usually buys much of the corn it imports from the U.S. .
That pace is causing some analysts to speculate that the Soviet Union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons .
One sign that more Soviet purchases are possible is that U.S. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts .
That sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn .
By some estimates several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn .
By buying futures contracts these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver .
Rumors of Soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts .
Among other things the Agriculture Department is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the Soviet Union .
On top of all this corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the Midwest harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of Indiana and Ohio .
The harvest delays however are expected to be temporary .
Balmy temperatures are forecast for next week said Robert Lekberg an analyst at Farmers Grain & Livestock Corp. Chicago .
Many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently harvested crop to grain elevator companies .
The heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally .
Wheat futures prices rose slightly .
In other commodity markets yesterday PRECIOUS METALS Futures prices declined .
A number of developments were negatively interpreted by traders .
December delivery gold fell 1.80 an ounce to 370.60 .
December silver eased 2.7 cents an ounce to 5.133 .
January platinum was down 3.60 an ounce at 491.10 .
One price-depressing development was the lower-than-expected increase of only 0.2 % in the consumer price index for September an analyst said .
He noted that the core inflation rate which excludes food and energy was also low at 0.2 % .
Other news that weighed on the market Initial unemployment claims rose by 62,000 last week American Telephone & Telegraph Co. will reduce its managerial staff by 15,000 through attrition the oil market turned weaker there was n't any investor demand for bullion and the dollar strengthened during the day putting pressure on gold .
Also the analyst said economic circumstances are such that both South Africa and the Soviet Union the principal gold and platinum producers are being forced to continue selling the metals .
Both are in great need of foreign exchange and South Africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments he said .
Putting it all together we have a negative scenario that does n't look like it will improve overnight he said .
COPPER Futures prices recovered in quiet trading .
The December contract rose 1.50 cents a pound to 1.2795 .
That contract fell a total of 5.75 cents during the first three days of this week mostly in reaction to last Friday 's stock market plunge which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the U.S. economy and thus reduced demand for copper a leading industrial metal .
In recent days however there has been increased purchasing of copper in London an analyst said .
Some of this buying was by Japan which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea Highland Valley mine in British Columbia and the Cananea mine in Mexico which are major shippers to Japan .
The increasing likelihood that Cananea and Highland Valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing but even if any of these mines begin operating soon their output wo n't be significant until at least the end of the year analysts note .
So one analyst said even though the long-term production problems may be easing there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three months when inventories will remain relatively low .
ENERGY Crude oil prices ended mixed .
West Texas Intermediate for November delivery fell 14 cents a barrel to 20.42 .
But so-called outer month contracts finished higher .
For instance December contracts for WTI rose 17 cents to 20.42 .
Most energy futures opened lower following Wednesday 's market downturn .
But a flurry of late trading yesterday beefed up prices .
Heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well .
Melvin Belli 's San Francisco law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after Tuesday 's earthquake .
In the first 25 minutes after his office 's telephone service was restored yesterday morning 17 potential clients had called seeking the services of the self-proclaimed King of Torts .
Mr. Belli like many other personal-injury lawyers suspects that the earthquake which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city 's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time .
Suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms contractors and developers as well as against local-government agencies .
But lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge .
Experts on California tort law say protections afforded government agencies in such cases are pretty ironclad .
Even claims against individuals and companies face significant roadblocks .
The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an act of God .
For now says Laurence Drivon president-elect of the 6,000-member California Trial Lawyers Association the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued or whether they have liability or not .
We still have people wandering around in a daze in San Francisco worrying about whether it 's going to rain tonight .
But that wo n't stop plaintiffs ' lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering .
In San Francisco they argue an earthquake was a near certainty .
Therefore engineering firms construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard and government agencies can be held accountable for failing to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster if negligence can be proven .
My prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting says Stanley Chesley a well-known Cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer .
From what he saw on television Mr. Chesley points out that Interstate 880 which collapsed and killed more than 200 commuters suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever .
He adds that they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the San Andreas Fault .
The flamboyant and publicity-conscious Mr. Belli says he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the Bay Bridge and the interstate approaching it .
We wo n't know until the smoke clears but yes we 're looking into it he says .
Mr. Belli says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage .
Mr. Belli who was at Candlestick Park for the World Series Tuesday night says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse .
Defense lawyers perhaps understandably say that plaintiffs ' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually .
A lot of this is going to be code-related says Ignazio J. Ruvolo a construction law specialist at Bronson Bronson & McKinnon a San Francisco law firm .
Plaintiffs he says will argue that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards .
But if defendants can prove that they met San Francisco 's stringent building codes that 's probably going to protect them Mr. Ruvolo says .
Government entities continues Mr. Ruvolo could be protected by the California Government Tort Liability Act .
Under the statute agencies are provided defenses that normally are n't available in the private sector Mr. Ruvolo says .
The legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public entities to liability .
Built into the statute are so-called design immunities which are likely to protect government agencies according to Mr. Ruvolo and Richard Covert a lawyer with the California Department of Transportation which oversees the damaged Bay Bridge .
The state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards says Mr. Covert .
He believes those defenses might well apply to the Bay Bridge collapse .
Nevertheless he adds I would n't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the Bay Bridge .
If there 's going to be a race to the courthouse it has n't started yet .
Mr. Covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday and Mr. Belli 's courtyard was strewn with bricks .
Wednesday Mr. Belli 's staff was n't permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety .
He said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town-house office and helped victims apply for federal aid free of charge .
In a news release issued by Mr. Drivon the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims .
The association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is unethical .
What 's in a name .
Apparently a lot according to the British firm of Deloitte Haskins & Sells .
The British firm has begun court proceedings in London to prevent the use of the name Deloitte by Deloitte Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross & Co. in England and the rest of the world .
The British Deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of Deloitte and Touche world-wide and joined Coopers & Lybrand .
John Bullock senior partner of Deloitte in the U.K. said the decision to start these proceedings has n't been taken lightly .
Mr. Bullock said the British firm has used the name Deloitte since 1845 .
In the U.S. Deloitte Haskins & Sells was known as Haskins & Sells until 1978 when it added the Deloitte name of its British affiliate .
John C. Burton an accounting professor at Columbia University 's Graduate School of Business said there 's a lot of emotion involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in England where accounting predates the U.S. .
Although accountants are n't noted as being deeply emotional they really hold it all in said Mr. Burton former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
J. Michael Cook chairman of Deloitte Haskins & Sells International said he believes the legal action by the British firm to be without merit .
Mr. Cook said that last June the international executive committes of Deloitte and Touche agreed to a world-wide merger .
The merger is proceeding according to plan except as to the withdrawal of the Deloitte U.K. firm he said .
Partners at other accounting firms say that the Deloitte firm in the U.K. is filing the suit to get even with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm for keeping major auditing work in England .
General Motors Corp. a Deloitte audit client for example has agreed to keep its annual 18 million world-wide audit and associated tax work with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm to be known as Deloitte & Touche in the U.S. .
In England this would mean that the British Deloitte would lose revenue for its audit of GM 's Vauxhill unit .
The defection of Deloitte 's affiliates in Britain and the Netherlands to Coopers & Lybrand will make Coopers one of the biggest accounting firms in Europe rivaling KPMG Peat Marwick there .
Although Coopers has n't been courted by other major accounting firms for a merger it is benefiting greatly from fallout from the Deloitte-Touche merger .
In New York Harris Amhowitz general counsel of Coopers said Coopers was aware of the litigation but he declined further comment .
He also declined to comment on the name that Coopers would use in England if Deloitte UK won its litigation to keep its name .
Coopers uses the Coopers & Lybrand name world-wide .
William Bennett the White House drug-policy director accused local officials in the Washington area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers .
Politics has essentially put up a roadblock to finding sites for new federal prisons Mr. Bennett said at a news conference called to report on his emergency assistance program for the capital .
Without more space to incarcerate convicted criminals he added we will not win the war on drugs .
Mr. Bennett declared in April that he would make Washington a test case for how the Bush administration would aid cities afflicted by heavy drug trafficking and violence .
The drug czar claimed that enfo
