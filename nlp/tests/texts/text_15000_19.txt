The Editor Nguyen Ngoc seemed an obvious choice when the Vietnamese Writers Association was looking for a new editor to reform its weekly newspaper Van Nghe .
After the sixth congress journalists seized the opportunity provided by the liberalization to probe previously taboo subjects .
Mr. Ngoc 57 years old had solid reformist credentials He had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature .
Appointed editor in chief in July 1987 Mr. Ngoc rapidly turned the staid Van Nghe into Vietnam 's hottest paper .
Circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover Vietnamese society and its ills .
Readers were electrified by the paper 's audacity and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered .
One article recounted a decade-long struggle by a wounded soldier to prove officially he was alive .
Another described how tax-collection officials in Thanh Hoa province one night stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers .
The newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by Nguyen Huy Thiep a former history teacher who stirred debate over his interpretation of Vietnamese culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association .
Van Nghe quickly made influential enemies .
Those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly to the restyled paper says Lai Nguyen An a literary critic .
After months of internal rumblings Mr. Ngoc was fired last December .
His dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that continues today .
Under Mr. Ngoc Van Nghe protected the people instead of the government says Nguyen Duy a poet who is the paper 's bureau chief for southern Vietnam .
The paper reflected the truth .
For the leadership that was too painful to bear .
The Billionaire Nguyen Thi Thi is Vietnam 's entrepreneur of the 1980s .
Her challenge is to keep her fledgling empire on top in the 1990s .
Mrs. Thi did n't wait for the reforms to get her start .
She charged ahead of the government and the law to establish Hochiminh City Food Co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country .
Her success which included alleviating an urban food shortage in the early 1980s helped persuade Hanoi to take the reform path .
Her story is becoming part of local folklore .
A lifelong revolutionary with little education who fought both the French and the U.S.-backed Saigon regime she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war .
Her instincts were capitalistic despite her background .
As she rode over regulations only her friendship with party leaders including Nguyen Van Linh then Ho Chi Minh City party secretary kept her out of jail .
Following Mr. Linh 's appointment as secretary-general of the party at the sixth congress Mrs. Thi has become the darling of doi moi the Vietnamese version of perestroika .
The authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of the new way of thinking .
Foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her Vietnam 's richest woman .
Some people call me the communist billionaire she has told visitors .
Actually 67-year-old Mrs. Thi is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land .
She has indeed turned Hochiminh City Food into a budding conglomerate but the company itself remains state-owned .
She manages it with the title of general-director .
The heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities such as corn and coffee from farmers in the south paying with fertilizer farm tools and other items .
Last year Hochiminh City Food says it bought two million metric tons of unhusked rice more than 10 % of the country 's output .
The company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses .
A subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that are sold with the rice through a vast retail network .
In recent years Mrs. Thi has started to diversify the company taking a 20 % stake in newly established partly private Industrial and Commercial Bank and setting up Saigon Petro which owns and operates Vietnam 's first oil refinery .
Mrs. Thi says Hochiminh City Food last year increased pretax profit 60 % to the equivalent of about 2.7 million on sales of 150 million .
She expects both revenue and profit to gain this year .
She is almost cavalier about the possibility Vietnam 's reforms will create rivals on her home turf .
I do n't mind the competition inside the country she says .
I am only afraid that with Vietnam 's poor-quality products we ca n't compete with neighboring countries .
The earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area is n't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings officials at the two major rating agencies said .
Standard & Poor 's Corp. is reviewing debt issued by 12 California counties and there are potential isolated problems said Hyman Grossman a managing director .
The agency is preparing a report to be issued today on the earthquake 's impact on the property- and casualty-insurance industry .
The only securities so far to be singled out are those issued by Bay View Federal Savings & Loan .
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing with an eye toward a possible downgrade the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company Bay View Capital Corp .
As for property and casualty insurers Moody 's said preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers ' financial condition but it raises concerns about potentially substantial risks longer-term .
Losses from the earthquake are expected to be of similar magnitude to those of Hurricane Hugo according to Moody 's .

Western Digital Corp. reported a net loss of 2.7 million or nine cents a share for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 citing factors as varied as hurricane damage an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar .
In the year-ago period the company earned 12.9 million or 45 cents a share on sales of 247 million .
Sales for the just-ended period fell to about 225 million the maker of computer parts said .
Nonetheless Chairman Roger W. Johnson said he expects the company to be profitable in the current quarter .
We are positioned to come through he said noting that the company 's backlog was up from the previous quarter .
In its second quarter last year Western Digital earned 12.7 million or 44 cents a share on sales of 258.4 million .
Mr. Johnson said Western Digital 's plant in Puerto Rico was affected by Hurricane Hugo losing three days ' production because of the storm which wrecked much of the Caribbean island 's infrastructure .
Although the plant itself was n't damaged Mr. Johnson said millions of dollars in first-quarter revenue were lost .
The revenue will be regained in the current period he added .
There are no plans to initiate a common stock dividend Mr. Johnson said explaining that the board continues to believe shareholders are best served by reinvesting excess cash .
Mr. Johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards .
Western Digital does n't make the monitors .
An accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers ' to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further dampened reseller purchases of Western Digital 's equipment .
The other areas of the business storage and microcomputers were very good Mr. Johnson said .
He said Western Digital has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array VGA graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter EGA which has a lower resolution standard technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units .
Other makers of video controller equipment also were caught in the EGA-VGA shift he said but we were able to respond much more quickly .
Still Mr. Johnson said our stock is grossly undervalued .
He said the company has cut operating expenses by about 10 % over the last few quarters while maintaining research and development at about 8 % to 9 % of sales .
As part of its reorganization this week Western Digital has divided its business into two segments storage products including controllers and disk drives and microcomputer products which include graphics communications and peripheral control chips .
Graphics communications and peripheral control chips were combined because increasingly multiple functions are being governed by a single chip .
Storage which includes computer controllers and 3.5-inch disk drives represents nearly two-thirds of the company 's business .
Disk drives which allow a computer to access its memory generated 38 % more revenue in the most recent period compared with the fiscal first quarter a year earlier .
Computer parts are getting ever smaller Mr. Johnson said a shrinking that has propelled laptops into position as the fastest-growing segment of the computer business .
As smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry he said Western Digital is strengthening development of laptop parts .
Next year Western Digital plans to consolidate its operations from 11 buildings in Irvine into two buildings in the same city a new headquarters and a block away a modern 100 million silicon wafer fabrication plant .
The plan will help the company in its existing joint manufacturing agreement with AT&T .
About half of Western Digital 's business is overseas and Mr. Johnson expects that proportion to continue .
Plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within Europe in 1992 creates significant opportunities for the company he said particularly since Western Digital already manufactures there .
Capitalizing on that presence Western Digital is launching a major effort to develop the embryonic reseller market in Europe .
Directors of state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank 's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution .
Until now BNL 's top managers and its directors have been appointed by a Treasury decree .

BNL which is controlled by the Italian Treasury was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq .
The ensuing scandal in which the bank 's management resigned has helped renew calls for privatization or at least an overhaul of Italy 's banking system which is about 80 % state-controlled .
In a related move the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure .
BNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals .
BNL has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange .
The shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the Atlanta scandal Consob the stock exchange regulatory body reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension .
