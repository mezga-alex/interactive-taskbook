Finally even the time-honored strategy called value investing no longer means what it once did .
Before the takeover mania of the '80s it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks especially those with shrewd management sound fundamentals and decent prospects .
Now says Mr. Biehl value investing often means looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble .
To institutional investors or brokers he adds a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up .

I was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries .
If the whole story were told it would read something like this During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and Use of Proceeds confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made .
The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings and management bonuses the price a sea of bad loans .
For the past several years the banks lacking a private navy to enforce their interests have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury to underwrite their bad LDC credits .
The Treasury wisely has refused but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans the Brady Plan .
The banks will threaten not to make further loans but in truth lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy they have no alternative but to go along .
George A. Wiegers Gillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to its board increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11 .
Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought 600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11 % stake and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board .
Separately Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2 % to 65.2 million or 57 cents a share from 63.9 million or 57 cents a share in the year-earlier period per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a 10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period .
Sales rose 9 % to 921.6 million from 845.7 million with sales of the company 's international\/diversified operations well above the year earlier-period .
For the nine months Gillette 's net income declined 1 % to 205.3 million or 2.02 a share from 207 million or 1.82 a share in the 1988 period .
Sales rose 6 % to 2.77 billion from 2.61 billion .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange the company closed yesterday at 45.50 a share up 25 cents .
When Walter Yetnikoff the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a 3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio Mr. Guber jumped at the chance .
Within two days he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony .
And before the week was out Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner Jon Peters the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business .
Not only that Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia 's future profits and buy their company Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for 200 million almost 40 % more than the market value of the company .
There was just one sticking point The two had a prior commitment .
Just seven months earlier they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for Warner Bros. for which they had just produced the smash hit Batman .
But Mr. Guber figured that Warner Communications Inc. chairman Steven Ross would empathize and let the producers go knowing the Sony offer was the culmination of a life 's work .
He figured wrong .
Last week following fruitless settlement talks Warner now merging with Time Inc. filed a 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters .
Sony promptly countersued charging Warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the U.S. movie business .
The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides As one Sony executive puts it It 's World War III .
That two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside Hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business .
And they are a very odd team in any case .
Mr. Guber was raised in Boston and educated in New York .
He is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees .
Mr. Peters is a high-school dropout who came to fame as Barbra Streisand 's hairdresser .
Yet they are far and away the most prolific producers in Hollywood .
And despite their share of duds they make movies that make money .
That is a skill Sony badly needs and Warner is loath to lose .
Although Columbia had a good summer with Ghostbusters II and When Harry Met Sally rivals such as Warner Paramount Pictures Walt Disney Co. and Universal Studios have been thrashing Columbia at the box office .
After five years of management turmoil with four different studio heads Columbia sorely needs a stable savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters are n't universally loved in Hollywood but they are well connected .
Their stock in trade as executive producers is sniffing out hot properties locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them .
Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a Flashdance or buy rights to a best seller such as The Color Purple .
It falls to others to do the writing directing and producing .
With MGM\/UA 's Rainman for instance Messrs. Guber and Peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production but their names still appear in big letters on the credits and they are inevitably associated with its success .
Sometimes as with Batman the pair really do make the film .
In that case Guber Peters acquired the rights in 1979 nursed the movie through a dozen scripts and were on the set in London for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production .
They 're the best production talent around says Brian De Palma beholden to Guber Peters for hiring him to direct the Warner movie of Tom Wolfe 's novel Bonfire of the Vanities .
On that film which is to start shooting in a few months they 've been very much involved hiring talent and discussing the development of the script .
And when you 're making a movie this big you need all the help you can get Mr. De Palma adds .
I wish they were around 24 hours a day .
And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention .
Warner executives blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in Caddyshack II for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure .
We 've had a few bombs admits Mr. Peters .
But by and large this company has only been profitable .
He says his company 's prowess at packaging and marketing is why we 'll be good at Columbia .
We practically ran our own studio .
Longtime Hollywood associates describe Mr. Guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing .
Peter is a major piece of Hollywood manpower who has really earned his success says Robert Bookman an agent at Creative Artists Agency .
Mark Johnson the producer of Rainman chimes in He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority .
It 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material .
Mr. Peters on the other hand has fewer fans in Hollywood and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully .
He gets better reviews as a creative whiz an enthusiast an idea man .
He also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did .
Barbra Streisand made him famous .
He cut her hair .
He lived with her .
He came to produce her records and her movies A Star Is Born and The Main Event .
Thrice married but now single Mr. Peters got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress Kim Basinger during the making of Batman .
Mr. Guber by contrast has been married to one woman for more than 20 years .
But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences they make the perfect good cop bad cop team Hollywood associates say .
Peter is the bright sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal says one agent .
If there 's a problem Peter disappears and all of a sudden Jon shows up .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way .
Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer who shepherded Flashdance through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie bristle when Messrs. Guber and Peters take credit for the film .
Says Mr. Simpson The script was unreadable .
We reinvented it .
We are the producers of that movie .
They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit as executive producers .
When Roger Birnbaum an executive who worked for Guber Peters in the early 1980s left to take a job as head of production at the United Artists studio they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop including Rainman and Batman .
Mr. Peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner .
I was upset with Roger I fumpered and schmumpered says Mr. Peters .
But he wanted to pursue his own dream and he went .
Still Mr. Birnbaum says his relationship with Guber Peters was one of the most successful I 've had in Hollywood .
The two have a wonderful chemistry Jon is very impulsive and Peter is very compulsive adds Mr. Birnbaum who is now head of production at News Corp. 's 20th Century Fox Film Co .
Jon Peters will come barreling into a room say he 's got a great idea and be gone .
Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific .
Mr. Birnbaum recalls that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey which became Gorillas in the Mist .
He says Within a few weeks we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey .
I think Peter even made some deals with the gorillas .
Universal Studios was working on a competing film but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with Guber Peters and Warner .
More recently Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest .
Messrs. Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man 's widow for months showing her a tape of Gorillas in the Mist to impress her with the quality of their work .
Money helped too .
Ultimately they paid more than 1 million for the rights .
The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband 's followers .
Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest .
It 's hardly astonishing given the men 's track record that Sony wants Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters .
But it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first .
Some note that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract .
But though people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters it 's good to have a partner and obviously the chemistry works says Steven Tisch a producer who once worked for Mr. Guber .
This business is n't about personalities at the end of the day it s about whether the ink is red or black .
In the case of Peter and Jon the ink has been very very black .
Mr. Guber got his start in the movie business at Columbia two decades ago .
Recruited from New York University 's MBA program he rose within two years to head of production overseeing such films as The Way We Were Taxi Driver Tommy and Shampoo .
In 1976 he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks later called Polygram Pictures where they produced such hits as as The Deep and Midnight Express .
In 1980 Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters by then a successful producer in his own right after the death of Mr. Bogart .
While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others their record was n't always so impressive .
Among their clinkers were The Legend of Billie Jean VisionQuest Clue and Clan of the Cave Bear .
And the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates .
The studio says it stuck with them even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner .
Mr. Guber replies that this is a Goliath this Time Warner trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters maintain that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse but that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony .
From the beginning they knew we had a goal and a dream says Mr. Guber .
On a number of occasions he adds he tried to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright .
They always listened but they never acted Mr. Guber says .
In 1987 Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a 28 % stake in Barris Entertainment a small-fry TV production company controlled by Giant Industries Inc. Chairman Burt Sugarman .
In July a year later Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs. Guber Peters and Sugarman made a 100 million offer to buy 25 % of MGM\/UA .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters planned to run the nearly dormant MGM studio and the two even tried to interest Warner Bros .
President Terry Semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal .
But the MGM plan collapsed just two weeks later .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price .
Their relationship with Mr. Sugarman soured shortly thereafter .
Last May he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co .
Meanwhile Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract .
The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind both financially and in terms of creative freedom .
But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month the chance at last to run a major studio about 50 million in deferred compensation up to 10 % of Columbia 's future cash flow 8 % of the future appreciation of Columbia 's market value and annual salaries of 2.7 million for each .
The producers ' 28 % share of publicly held Guber Peters would net them an additional 50 million .
Sony also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to Warner .
Sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only 42 million last year .
And earnings have been erratic .
In the the latest quarter thanks in part to Batman Guber Peters earned 5.8 million or 50 cents a share compared to a loss of 6.8 million or 62 cents a share in last year 's quarter .
Guber Peters stock which traded as low as 6 a share last year closed yesterday at 16.625 .
The two sides now are accusing each other of lying .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise .
But in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court Mr. Ross Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made .
Warner in its court filings calls it a piece of fiction created for this litigation .
Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different .
For one thing according to Mr. Daly the producers requested a release in advance .
Moreover the old contract was about to expire and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now .
Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights and it was in Warner 's interest to accommodate MGM\/UA Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives Mr. Daly said in his affidavit .
Warner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia .
At the very least Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony .
During settlement talks for example Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner according to executives involved in the talks .
In any settlement Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years notably sequels to Batman .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner .
And they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts .
The last time Columbia Pictures was looking for a studio chief they note Warner released producer David Puttnam from his contract then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at Columbia .
In his affidavit filed yesterday Warner 's Mr. Ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument If Sony succeeds here no written contract in Hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on .
THE SALES PITCH could n't sound better .
First there 's the name asset-backed securities .
Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing .
And there 's more .
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest and most secure institutions .
Most earn high ratings from credit agencies .
Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues .
And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors .
Ready to jump .
Well think twice .
The concept may be simple Take a bunch of loans tie them up in one neat package and sell pieces of the package to investors .
But the simplicity may be misleading .
Skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk .
They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them and those are hard to evaluate .
Moreover the securities were introduced only about 4 1\/2 years ago the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession .
A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters says Owen Carney director of the investment securities division of the U.S. comptroller of the currency .
We do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn .
Such concerns however have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products .
Since the spring of 1985 financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities .
They have sold issues backed by car loans boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans .
They have offered bundles of homeequity loans as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares .
Last year there was an issue of death-backed bonds securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders .
Some predict there will be Third World bonds backed by loans to Brazil Argentina and other debt-ridden nations .
And the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables sometimes known as plastic bonds .
This is the heyday of debt says James Grant editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer a newsletter .
Before the sun sets on the '80s it seems nothing will be left unhocked .
The result is a 45 billion market according to Securities Data Co .
That includes more than 9.5 billion issued through August of this year up sharply from 6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period and more than in all of 1987 .
Most issues have been sold to professional money managers pension funds bank trust departments and other institutions .
But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market .
The entry fee is affordable Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of 1,000 .
We expect additional offerings of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors says Bill Addiss a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
The process typically begins when an institution such as Citibank or Sears Roebuck & Co. takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust .
The trust then issues securities generally due in five years or less that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors .
Issues typically come with credit enhancements such as a bank letter of credit and thus have received high credit ratings .
Enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions .
Asset-backed securities are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds says Craig J. Goldberg managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
But skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks .
Consider a 500 million offering of 9 % securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables .
The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues .
On a 10,000 investment that 's a difference of only 50 a year .
That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street .
But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have that margin is meaningless .
If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby then even an extra 25 basis points 0.25 percentage point becomes an important consideration on a career basis says Mr. Grant .
But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again then that is n't of overwhelming importance .
Moreover the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level .
That 's why some investment managers such as Alex Powers a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states such as New York or California .
But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts such as retirement plans .
He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts .
Another concern is liquidity or how easily a security can be converted into cash .
The secondary or resale market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues .
That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature .
That 's particularly true analysts say for certain of the securities such as those backed by time-share loans .
You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market says Jonathan S. Paris a vice president of European Investors Inc. a New York investment-management firm .
In addition an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange can simply check newspaper listings .
There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities .
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem .
Investors for instance may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities .
It is n't .
The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters t
