 having committed any crime .
Seventeen articles of impeachment against the Florida judge one of the few blacks on the U.S. bench were approved by the House in August 1988 .
The central charge against Judge Hastings is that he conspired with a Washington lawyer to obtain a 150,000 bribe from defendants in a criminal case before the judge in return for leniency .
He is also accused of lying under oath and of leaking information obtained from a wiretap he supervised .
The Senate 's public gallery was packed with Judge Hastings ' supporters who erupted into applause after he finished his argument .
Judge Hastings who was acquitted of similar charges by a federal jury in 1983 claims he is being victimized and that the impeachment proceedings against him constitute double jeopardy .
But Rep. John Bryant D. Texas the lead counsel for the House managers who conducted a lengthy inquiry into Judge Hastings ' activities said a mountain of evidence points to his certain guilt .
The Senate will deliberate behind closed doors today and is scheduled to vote on the impeachment tomorrow .
If the judge is impeached as is thought likely he will be removed from office immediately .
However Judge Hastings has said he will continue to fight and is contemplating an appeal of any impeachment to the U.S. Supreme Court .
COMPANIES SEEKING to make insurers pay for pollution cleanup win court victory .
In a case involving Avondale Industries Inc. and its insurer Travelers Cos. the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say are central to dozens of pollution cases around the country .
Travelers and other insurers have maintained that cleanup costs are n't damages and thus are n't covered under commercial policies .
They also have argued that government proceedings notifying a company of potential responsibility do n't fit the legal definition of a lawsuit thus such governmental proceedings are n't covered by the policies the insurers say .
The appeals court disagreed on both counts .
Avondale was notified by Louisiana officials in 1986 that it was potentially responsible for a cleanup at an oil-recycling plant .
Avondale asked Travelers to defend it in the state proceeding but the insurer did n't respond .
The appeals court upheld a district judge 's ruling that the insurer had to defend the company in such proceedings .
The appeals court also said We think an ordinary businessman reading this policy would have believed himself covered for the demands and potential damage claims stemming from any cleanup .
This decision will have a very considerable impact said Kenneth Abraham professor of environmental law and insurance law at the University of Virginia because many commercial insurance policies are issued by companies based in New York .
William Greaney an attorney for the Chemical Manufacturers Association said that while other appeals courts have ruled differently on whether cleanup costs are damages the influence of the appeals court in New York will make insurers sit up and listen .
He said the decision was the first in which a federal appeals court has ruled whether administrative government proceedings qualify as litigation .
Barry R. Ostrager an attorney for Travelers said there are procedural bases on which this case will be appealed further .
NEW YORK 'S poor face nearly three million legal problems a year without legal help .
That is the conclusion of a report released by the New York State Bar Association .
The report was based on a telephone survey of 1,250 low-income households across the state a mail survey of major legal-services programs and on-site interviews with individuals in the field .
The report provides detailed documentation of the extent and nature of the problem and indicates how we may want to shape solutions said Joseph Genova chairman of the committee that oversaw the survey and a partner at the law firm of Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy .
According to the study slightly more than 34 % of those surveyed reported having at least one housing problem every year for which they had no legal help .
Nearly 36 % ranked housing problems as their most serious unmet legal need .
Other areas targeted by the survey 's respondents included difficulty obtaining or maintaining public benefits 22 % consumer fraud 15.4 % and health-care issues 15 % .
During the 15-month survey 43 % of all legal-services programs said that at some period they were unable to accept new clients unless they had an emergency .
Mr. Genova said the committee may meet to propose solutions to the problems identified in the study .

After failing to find a buyer for the Sears Tower in Chicago Sears Roebuck & Co. is negotiating with Boston pension fund adviser Aldrich Eastman & Waltch Inc. to refinance the property for close to 850 million according to people close to the negotiations .
Under the proposed agreement involving the world 's tallest building Chicago-based Sears would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage .
At the end of the term of the convertible loan Sears could still own half the building and AEW could own the other half .
Neither side would comment .
The parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building which will be emptied of 6,000 employees from Sears ' merchandise group which is moving elsewhere .
The new manager will face the daunting task of leasing 1.8 million square feet in a relatively soft Chicago real estate market .
Also it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage AEW will be able to convert into equity .
Convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late .
In a convertible mortgage the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity usually less than 50 % at the end of the loan term .
During the term the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return .
The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal .
Sears said it would put the 110-story tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its anti-takeover restructuring .
But Japanese institutions shied away from bidding on the high-profile tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger anti-Japanese sentiment .
Last summer Sears appeared to have a deal with Canadian developer Olympia & York Developments Ltd .
But that deal fell through in September after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax reassessment raising property taxes and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices .
Real estate industry executives said Sears ' investment banker Goldman Sachs & Co. sought financing in Japan .
However Japanese authorities apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too much publicity .
Sears then went back to AEW the Boston pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring .
AEW has 3.5 billion of real estate investments nationwide according to a spokesman .
Tandy Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire two units of Datatronic AB of Stockholm for cash .
The amount was n't disclosed .
The electronics maker and retailer previously estimated the sale price at between 100 million and 200 million for Datatronic 's Victor microcomputer and Micronic hand-held computer subsidiaries .
In addition Tandy will acquire rights to the Victor and Micronic names for computers .
During 1988 the Datatronic subsidiaries had combined sales in excess of 200 million .
The transaction will give Tandy a well-known European computer brand that includes 2,700 dealers and distributors marketing to medium-sized business and educational institutions .
Closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals the company said .
Two rules in pending congressional legislation threaten to hinder leveraged buy-outs by raising the price tags of such deals by as much as 10 % .
Wall Street is seething over the rules which would curtail the tax deductibility of debt used in most LBOs .
The provisions in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s some tax experts and investment bankers argue .
Indeed some investment bankers have already started restructuring deals to cope with the expected rules .
Wall Street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous Senate version of one of the provisions .
At issue is the deductibility of certain junk bonds that are used in most LBOs .
Such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value with interest accruing instead of being paid to the holder .
Under current rules that accrued interest is deductible by the company issuing the debt .
The House version of the legislation would kill that deduction and label any such debt as equity which is n't deductible .
The less-rigorous Senate version would defer the deductibility for roughly five years .
You see these in just about every LBO said Robert Willens senior vice president in charge of tax issues at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York .
It becomes a source of cash for the company making the LBO because it gets a deduction and does n't have to repay the debt for several years .
Typically Mr. Willens estimates this type of debt makes up 15 % to 20 % of the financing for LBOs .
These types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as RJR Nabisco Inc. Storer Communications Inc. and Kroger Co .
A second provision passed by the Senate and House would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from LBO debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years .
For example if a company posted a loss of 100 million from buy-out interest payments the existing rule would allow the concern to be able to receive a refund from the tax it paid from 1986 through 1989 when it may have been a profitable public company .
But that rule is being virtually overlooked by Wall Street which is concentrating on coping with the deduction issue .
Prices for LBOs have to come down if you do n't have that feature argued Lawrence Schloss managing director for merchant banking at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York .
Several Wall Street officials say the proposed legislation already is having an impact .
An investment group led by Chicago 's Pritzker family recently lowered a 3.35 billion bid for American Medical International Beverly Hills Calif. because of the threat of the legislation .
Moreover one investment banker who requested anonymity said his firm did n't raise the ante for a target company earlier this month after a stronger bid emerged from a public company that was n't concerned about the financing provision .
We would have paid more if we thought that law was n't going to pass he said .
One possible solution for Wall Street is to increase the equity part of the transaction that is give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments .
That would force the buy-out firm and the target company 's management to reduce their level of ownership .
The pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through said Peter C. Canellos tax partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz .
Another solution said a tax lawyer who requested anonymity is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount .
Since they have a lower interest rate they would n't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility .
The House version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes has at least a five-year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five .
The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible .
The Senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid .
Currently even though the issuer does n't pay tax the debt holder is taxed on the accrued interest .
But those holders are often foreign investors and tax-exempt pension funds that do n't pay taxes on their holdings .
The Senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield 17 million the first year and a total of 409 million over five years .
The House version would raise slightly more .
Even if Wall Street finds ways around the new rules a Senate aide contends LBOs will become somewhat more difficult .
There 's no question it will make LBOs more expensive he said .
The interest deduction was the engine that made these things more productive .
The average publicly offered commodity fund fell 4.2 % in September largely because of the volatile markets in foreign currencies according to Norwood Securities .
The firm said that losers outnumbered gainers by more than three to one among the 122 funds it tracks .
For the first nine months of the year Norwood said the average fund has lost 3.3 % .
The government moved aggressively to open the spigots of federal aid for victims of the California earthquake but its reservoir of emergency funds must be replenished soon if the aid is to continue .
President Bush signed a disaster declaration covering seven Northern California counties .
The declaration immediately made the counties eligible for temporary housing grants and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses .
In addition an unusually wide array of federal agencies moved to provide specialized assistance .
The Department of Housing and Urban Development prepared to make as many as 100 vacant houses available for those left homeless the Agriculture Department was set to divert food from the school-lunch program to earthquake victims and the Pentagon was providing everything from radio communications to blood transfusions to military police for directing traffic .
But the pool of federal emergency-relief funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of cleaning up Hurricane Hugo and Congress will be under pressure to allocate more money quickly .
In Hugo 's wake Congress allocated 1.1 billion in relief funds and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said 273 million of that money remains and could be diverted for quick expenditures related to the earthquake .
Now though enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief .
That obviously means that we wo n't have enough for all of the emergencies that are now facing us and we will have to consider appropriate requests for follow-on funding Mr. Fitzwater said .
The federal government is n't even attempting yet to estimate how much the earthquake will cost it .
But Mr. Fitzwater said There will be I think quite obviously a very large amount of money required from all levels of government .
In Congress lawmakers already are looking for ways to add relief funds .
Money could be added to a pending spending bill covering the Federal Emergency Management Agency which coordinates federal disaster relief .
More likely relief funds could be added to an omnibus spending bill that Congress is to begin considering next week .
But it is n't just Washington 's relief dollars that are spread thin its relief manpower also is stretched .
FEMA still has special disaster centers open to handle the aftermath of Hugo and spokesman Russell Clanahan acknowledged that we 're pretty thin .
Mr. Clanahan says FEMA now possibly may have the heaviest caseload in its history .
To further complicate relief efforts the privately funded American Red Cross also finds itself strapped for funds after its big Hugo operation .
It 's been a bad month money-wise and every other way said Sally Stewart a spokeswoman for the Red Cross .
It just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget .
The Red Cross has opened 30 shelters in the Bay area serving 5,000 people .
Twenty-five trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other states .
All the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to California wo n't be determined until state officials make specific requests to FEMA agency officials said .
And in the confusion after the earthquake the information flow is a little slow coming in from the affected area said Carl Suchocki a FEMA spokesman .
Still some aid is moving westward from Washington almost immediately .
HUD officials said they will make available as many as 100 Bay area houses that are under HUD loans but now are vacant after the houses have been inspected to ensure they are sound .
Additional housing vouchers and certificates will be made available officials said and some housing and community-development funds may be shifted from other programs or made available for emergency use .
Another federal agency not normally associated with disaster relief the Internal Revenue Service moved quickly as well .
The IRS said it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake 's devastation .
The agency plans to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days .
And the Treasury said residents of the San Francisco area will be able to cash in savings bonds even if they have n't held them for the minimum six-month period .
One advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the San Francisco Bay area facilities that provide a ready base of supplies and workers .
Even before the full extent of the devastation was known Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the Pentagon and prepare to respond to various FEMA requests for assistance .
By yesterday afternoon Air Force transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies physicians communications equipment and FEMA personnel to California .
A military jet flew a congressional delegation and senior Bush administration officials to survey the damage .
And the Pentagon said dozens of additional crews and transport aircraft were on alert awaiting orders to move emergency supplies .
Two Air Force facilities near Sacramento and Travis Air Force Base 50 miles northeast of San Francisco were designated to serve as medical-airlift centers .
Some victims also were treated at the Letterman Army Medical Center in San Francisco and at the Naval Hospital in Oakland .
In addition 20 military police from the Presidio a military base in San Francisco are assisting with traffic control and a Navy ship was moved from a naval station at Treasure Island near the Bay Bridge to San Francisco to help fight fires .
To help residents in Northern California rebuild FEMA intends to set up 17 disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with 400 to 500 workers from various agencies said Robert Volland chief of the agency 's individual assistance division .
At these offices earthquake victims will be helped in filling out a one-page form that they will need to qualify for such federal assistance as home-improvement loans and to repair houses .
And federal officials are promising to move rapidly with federal highway aid to rebuild the area 's severely damaged road system .
The Federal Highway Administration has an emergency relief program to help states and local governments repair federally funded highways and bridges seriously damaged by natural disasters .
The account currently has 220 million .
And though federal law dictates that only 100 million can be disbursed from that fund in any one state per disaster administration officials expect Congress to move in to authorize spending more now in California .
To get that money states must go through an elaborate approval process but officials expect red tape to be cut this time .
Keith Mulrooney special assistant to Federal Highway Administrator Thomas Larson also said that after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in Southern California the state set tougher standards for bridges and with federal aid began a program to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake hazards .
The first phase of the program has been completed but two other phases are continuing .
The two major structures that failed Tuesday night he said were both built well before the 1971 earthquake the San Francisco Bay Bridge completed in the 1930s and the section of I-880 built in the 1950s .
The I-880 section had completed the first phase of the retrofitting .

Northrop Corp. 's third-quarter net income fell 25 % to 21.5 million or 46 cents a share while General Dynamics Corp. reported nearly flat earnings of 76.5 million or 1.83 a share .
Los Angeles-based Northrop recorded an 8.2 % decline in sales as B-2 Stealth bomber research-and-development revenue continued to ebb and high costs on some other programs cut into profit .
The aerospace concern earned 28.8 million or 61 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales in the latest period were 1.25 billion down from 1.36 billion in the 1988 quarter .
At St. Louis-based General Dynamics sales rose 10 % to 2.52 billion from 2.29 billion .
It earned 76.4 million or 1.82 a share in the 1988 quarter .
General Dynamics credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments an earnings recovery in submarine operations and higher military aircraft sales .
Northrop said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 development dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F\/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor McDonnell Douglas Corp .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Northrop shares closed at 21.125 off 25 cents .
General Dynamics closed at 54.875 up 50 cents .
Northrop which since early 1988 has declined to accept fixed-price contracts for research and development said earnings were hurt by excessive costs on a number of such contracts won years ago .
Among them were the ALQ-135 electronic countermeasures system for the F-15 fighter .
Northrop 's interest expense also soared to 35 million from 17 million a year ago .
It said debt remained at the 1.22 billion that has prevailed since early 1989 although that compared with 911 million at Sept. 30 1988 .
The backlog of undelivered orders at Northrop on Sept. 30 was 4.68 billion down from 5.16 billion a year earlier .
For the nine months Northrop reported a net loss of 46.9 million or 1 a share compared with profit of 190.3 million or 4.05 a share in 1988 .
Sales dipped 3.6 % to 3.92 billion from 4.07 billion .
At General Dynamics factors reducing earnings in the military aircraft segment included higher levels of cost-sharing in development of the Advanced Tactical Fighter and the high cost of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter .
F-16 deliveries also have fallen slightly behind schedule although a return to the previous schedule is expected in 1990 the company said .
Backlog at General Dynamics rose to 16.5 billion from 15.8 billion .
Its interest expense surged to 21.5 million from 12.4 million .
For the nine months General Dynamics earned 210.3 million or 5.03 a share up marginally from 208.8 million or 4.97 a share on a 4.9 % rise in sales to 7.41 billion from 7.06 billion .
Lotus Development Corp. reported a surprisingly strong 51 % increase in third-quarter net income on a 32 % sales gain buoyed by strong demand for a new version of its 1-2-3 computer spreadsheet .
The results topped analysts ' expectations and the earnings growth of competitors prompting traders to all but forget the product-launch delays that bogged down the company for much of the past two years .
Yesterday in heavy national over-the-counter trading Lotus shares rose to 32.50 up 1.25 apiece capping a threemonth run-up of more than 40 % .
Lotus said net rose to 23 million or 54 cents a share on sales of 153.9 million .
A year ago net was 14.3 million or 31 cents a share on sales of 116.8 million .
For the nine months net of 38.5 million or 92 cents a share trailed the year earlier 's 49.9 million or 1.08 a share .
Sales rose to 406 million from 356 million the year earlier .
In the first half Lotus struggled to keep market share with costly promotions while customers awaited the launch of 1-2-3 Release 3 the upgraded spreadsheet software .
Lotus 's results were about 10 % higher than analysts ' average expectations and compared favorably with the 36 % earnings rise reported a day earlier by rival Microsoft Corp. of Redmond Wash .
The company said results were bolstered by upgrades to Release 3 by previous customers and improved profit margins the result of manufacturing-cost controls .
Rick Sherlund a Goldman Sachs analyst said Lotus had upgrade revenue of about 22 million in the quarter twice what he had expected .
Also he estimated unit shipments of 1-2-3 in all its forms were about 315,000 up 7 % from 1988 's quarterly average .
Demand for the new version was enabling Lotus to raise prices with distributors and to hold market share against Microsoft and other competitors that tried to exploit the earlier delays in Release 3 's launch Mr. Sherlund added .
He estimated that 1-2-3 outsold Microsoft 's Excel spreadsheet by four-to-one in the quarter and held a 70 % or better share of the spreadsheet market .
Silicon Valley heaved a sigh of relief yesterday .
Though details were sketchy in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high-tech corridor along with the rest of the San Francisco Bay area a spot check of computer makers turned up little if any potentially lingering damage to facilities or fabrication equipment .
Analysts and corporate officials said they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the Valley of either hardware or software goods .
Intel Corp. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. were all up and running yesterday though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways others elected to take the day off .
These systems are more rugged than many people would believe said Thomas Kurlak who tracks the computer industry for Merrill Lynch Research .
It 's not the end of the world if you shake them up a little bit .
Other companies including International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. completely idled their operations because of Tuesday evening 's temblor which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale .
Personnel spent the morning inspecting buildings for structural weaknesses mopping up water from broken pipes and clearing ceiling tiles and other debris from factory floors .
Still many were confident that in a day or two everything should be back to normal according to a spokeswoman for the Semiconductor Industry Association based in Cupertino .
IBM for instance said it anticipates returning to a normal work schedule by the weekend at its San Jose plant which puts out disk drives for the 3090 family of mainframes .
A Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman said that while things are a big mess some 18,000 Valley employees have been called back to work today .
Apple Computer added that it was being cautiously optimistic despite not yet closely eyeballing all of its 50 buildings in the region .
Even the carefully calibrated machinery in its giant Fremont plant to the north of the Valley was believed to be undamaged .
Sun Microsystems Inc. and Tandem Computers Inc. also signaled that they should recover quickly .
Digital Equipment Corp. with major facilities in Santa Clara Cupertino Palo Alto and Mountain View said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in Maynard Mass. Tuesday night .
None sustained significant damage a spokesman said adding that the delicate manufacturing process machines were checked and were all found to be operating normally .
For many companies of course there is still a slew of nagging problems to grapple with some of which have the potential to become quite serious .
For example a spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices said the Sunnyvale chip maker is worried about blackouts .
A sudden surge or drop in electric power could ruin integrated circuits being built .
But given what might have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the microelectronics business the bulk of Valley companies seemed to be just about shouting hosannas .
Several factors apparently spared the Valley a sprawling suburban stretch from San Jose to Palo Alto from the kind of impact felt in San Francisco an hour 's drive north .
For one thing buildings there tend to be newer and thus in step with the latest safety codes .
Also the soil in the Valley is solid unlike the landfill of San Francisco 's downtown Marina District which was hit with fires and vast destruction .
In addition some microelectronics companies said they were prepared for tremulous conditions like Tuesday 's .
Their machine tools are even bolted to the shop floor .
Intel said that over the past decade it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves sensitive to the shake of an earthquake in the pipes that snake through its plants .
Like other large Valley companies Intel also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation so that a breakdown at one location should n't leave customers in a total pinch .
That 's certainly good news for such companies as Compaq Computer Corp. Houston which has only a four-day supply of microprocessors from the Valley on hand because of a just-in-time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory .
Compaq said it foresees no difficulties in obtaining parts in the immediate future .
Computer makers were scrambling to help customers recover from the disaster .
Digital Equipment has set up disaster-recovery response centers in Dallas Atlanta and Colorado Springs Colo .
These units were handling calls both from people in the San Francisco area and from computers themselves which are set to dial Digital automatically when trouble arises .
They then run remotely controlled self-diagnostic programs .
Digital also said it has dispatched teams of technicians to California .
Meanwhile several other major installations around the Valley America 's center of high-tech said they too fared as well as could be expected .
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where the Energy Department tests and conducts research on nuclear weapons had only superficial damage a spokesman said .
At Lockheed Corp. 's missiles and space systems group in Sunnyvale about 40 miles south of San Francisco workers were asked to head to work yesterday after it was realized that there were no show-stoppers in the 150-plus buildings on its one-square-mile campus .
Several engineering and research offices needed closer scrutiny to make sure they were n't in danger of crumbling but the bulk of the place is in pretty good shape an official said .
One of Lockheed 's most lucrative sectors accounting for more than half the aerospace company 's 10.59 billion in sales in 1988 the missiles and space group is the prime Pentagon contractor on the Trident II ballistic missile .
It also generates pieces of the missile shield called the Strategic Defense Initiative .
Fortunately the Hubble Space Telescope set to be launched on the shuttle next year in a search for distant solar systems and light emitted 14 billion years ago from the farthest reaches of the universe was moved from Sunnyvale to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at the beginning of October .

Michael Maynard offered the world a faster way to break eggs .
As thanks the egg industry tried to break him .
And the egg producers have done a pretty good job .
They tried to put Mr. Maynard out of business by an act of Congress .
Egg-industry lobbying helped persuade six states to ban Mr. Maynard 's automatic egg-breaking machine because of fears over salmonella .
His company Misa Manufacturing Inc. was forced to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in 1987 and has since been liquidated .
Monthly sales of his Egg King machine which he now is marketing through a new company have sunk to about half a dozen from a peak of 75 says the 46-year-old businessman .
Mr. Maynard is n't the first entrepreneur to bump up against entrenched interests .
But his case is notable both for the scale of the fight it is n't often that a congressional hearing is held to determine whether one small businessman is a threat to the republic and for what it tells about the pitfalls of marketing a new product .
Now one might ask why people who sell eggs would fight someone who is trying to make it easier to crack them .
Part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry .
Many larger egg producers are also egg processors who crack inspect and sanitize billions of eggs turning them into powdered liquified or frozen egg products .
However dozens of bakers restaurant chefs and other food preparers who flocked to Mr. Maynard 's defense say that products ranging from egg bread to eclairs lose some zip when the eggs come in 30-pound cans instead of shells .
But for companies that use hundreds of eggs a day breaking them by hand can get well out of hand .
The idea behind the Egg King is pretty simple put the eggs into a cylinder that contains perforated baskets spin them at a high speed to break the shells and strain the edible part through the baskets .
One Egg King which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide has been likened to the robot R2-D2 can crack about 20,000 eggs an hour .
Because fresh eggs are less expensive than processed ones a big egg user can recover the Egg King 's 3,390 cost in a few months says Mr. Maynard .
Such centrifugal egg breakers have been around since the 1890s .
But when Mr. Maynard came forward with his machine in the early 1970s nobody else was offering them in the U.S. .
The main reason salmonella .
Chickens carry this bacteria which can cause upset stomachs and in rare cases death among people .
Hens sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs and it can also be found on unclean shells .
Thus any machine that breaks large amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread salmonella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones .
Mr. Maynard claims this is a manageable problem .
The Egg King carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have been properly sanitized and as an added precaution to use the eggs only in products that will be cooked enough to kill bacteria .
With nearly 4,000 machines in use there have been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed Mr. Maynard boasts .
He says the handful of salmonella cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an Egg King stemmed from a failure to adequately cook the products .
But he says that 's no more a reason for banning Egg Kings than bad drivers are a reason for banning cars .
Opponents do n't buy such arguments .
Human nature being what it is people do n't always follow instructions says Jack Guzewich chief of food protection for the New York state Health Department .
Leading the assault against the Egg King has been United Egg Producers .
The Decatur Ga. trade group has issued a briefing book that claims the machine is a health hazard and that Mr. Maynard is trying to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation 's egg producers .
The UEP declines to comment but the group 's attorney Alfred Frawley says the group 's actions are motivated solely by health concerns .
An early battleground was the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Mr. Maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at egg-processing facilities regulated by the USDA 's Food Safety Inspection Service .
Unfortunately for Mr. Maynard another branch of the USDA the Agricultural Marketing Service was in charge of eggs .
After receiving complaints from egg producers this branch got the other branch to rescind its approval thus limiting the machine 's potential market to bakeries and restaurants and other establishments that are n't regulated by the USDA .
The egg producers also lobbied the Food and Drug Administration .
But the FDA in a 1985 letter to the United Egg Producers said that there was little likelihood of a health problem as long as instructions were followed .
So the producers went to Capitol Hill where a congressman from Georgia introduced a measure to ban centrifugal egg-breaking machines .
Mr. Maynard whose company at the time was based in Santa Ana Calif. enlisted his local congressman and the battle was joined .
Mr. Maynard 's forces finally defeated the measure though it took a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives to do it .
Even then opponents managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called an unscrupulous method for breaking eggs .
Foiled in their effort to get a national ban the egg producers turned their attention to the states .
So far New York New Jersey Nebraska Georgia Michigan and Minnesota have outlawed Mr. Maynard 's device citing health concerns .
An antitrust suit that Mr. Maynard 's company filed in Los Angeles federal court against the United Egg Producers and others only added to the entrepreneur 's woes .
The judge dismissed the suit and ordered Mr. Maynard 's company to pay over 100,000 in legal fees to the defendants ' lawyers .
Mr. Maynard says the ruling pushed his company into bankruptcy court .
Now he has moved to Oklahoma where costs are lower and started a new company Adsi Inc. to market his machine .
But so far the change of scenery has n't ended his string of bad breaks .
Mr. Maynard recently fell from a horse and fractured his arm .
Michelle Pfeiffer ca n't chew gum and sing at the same time .
But on the evidence of The Fabulous Baker Boys that may be the only thing she ca n't do at least when she 's acting in movies .
As the tough slinky lounge chanteuse in The Fabulous Baker Boys Ms. Pfeiffer sings for herself and more than passably well .
Her Susie Diamond handles a song the way the greats do like she 's hearing the way it should sound inside her head and she 's concentrating on matching that internal tone .
Yet her intensity stops and starts with the music .
When she is n't performing for an audience she prepares for a song by removing the wad of gum from her mouth and indicates that she 's finished by sticking the gum back in .
Like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie Ms. Pfeiffer 's Susie seems like someone you 've seen before in numerous show-biz stories even her name Susie Diamond sounds like a character Marilyn Monroe must have played .
Yet nothing about Baker Boys and certainly nothing about Ms. Pfeiffer really is like something from the video vault .
Steve Kloves the young writer and director he is n't yet 30 has only one produced picture to his credit he wrote the screenplay for Racing With the Moon a lovely coming-of-age picture set in the '40s .
Both movies are infused with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older someone who does n't dismiss dreams but who also has enough experience to see his limits .
However Mr. Kloves directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace Baker Boys is both bluesy and funny .
He 's put a fresh spin on material that could come off terribly cliched for example the way Susie wows an audience the first time she sings with the Baker Boys .
Of course it does n't hurt that Mr. Kloves has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly what they 're doing .
Much of the picture 's sensuality emerges from cinematographer Michael Ballhaus 's slyly seductive lens work .
After working for years with Werner Rainer Fassbinder the late German director and more recently with Martin Scorsese After Hours The Color of Money The Last Temptation of Christ Mr. Ballhaus has developed a distinctively fluid style .
And Dave Grusin 's witty score embraces the banal requirements of banquet-hall musicianship Feelings is a must without condescension .
Though Ms. Pfeiffer has the flashy part she gets the best comic bits and to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heels the boys are pretty great too .
What seemed like a good idea to cast the Bridges brothers Jeff and Beau as the Baker brothers actually turned out to be a good idea .
Anyone who 's tried to appear natural in front of a camera knows that it 's much more natural to end up looking like a stiff .
So it 's quite possible that the terrific play between the brothers is n't natural at all that Jeff and Beau had to work like crazy to make their brotherly love and resentment and frustration and rage seem so very real .
When the movie opens the Baker brothers are doing what they 've done for 15 years professionally and twice as long as that for themselves They 're playing proficient piano face-to-face on twin pianos .
They 're small time in the small time-hotels not the best ones and restaurants in Seattle .
Yet they do n't disparage their audiences by disparaging their act .
They wear tuxedos most nights unless circumstances a regular gig at a tropical lounge for example require them to wear special costumes like Hawaiian shirts .
Plump Beau looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face plays the older brother Frank .
Frank plans the program takes care of business and approaches the work like any other job .
He 's even able to think of a job that takes him out of the house 300 nights a week as an ordinary job .
He 's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs the audience sees only the house and only near the end of the movie .
Frank grovels a little for the bookers probably no more or less than he would have to if he worked for a big corporation .
On his off-hours he wears cardigan sweaters .
Jeff Bridges is the younger brother Jack who fancies himself the rebellious artist he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs who climbs down the fire escape .
Yet Jack 's the one who can remember every dive they ever played and when and he dutifully shows up for work night after night he consoles himself with booze and by showing up at the last minute .
Looking leaner than he has in a while the younger Mr. Bridges 's Jack is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than Frank who 's managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated .
He can live with little pleasures .
Mr. Kloves has put together some priceless moments .
These include Jennifer Tilly 's audition to be the Baker Boys ' girl singer .
Ms. Tilly of the tweety-bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster 's girlfriend on the television show Hill Street Blues .
Here she delivers especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the Candy Man which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that could n't be more perfect .
It matches her voice .
And Ms. Pfeiffer 's particular version of Making Whoopee and the way Mr. Ballhaus photographs her from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress might make you think of Marilyn Monroe if Ms. Pfeiffer had n't gone and become a star in her own right .
VIDEO TIP If you 'd like to see the first time Michelle Pfeiffer sang on screen and you have a lot of patience take a look at Grease 2 .
You 'll find her there .
Better yet check out the emergence of her comic persona in Married to the Mob Jonathan Demme 's delightful Mafia comedy .
