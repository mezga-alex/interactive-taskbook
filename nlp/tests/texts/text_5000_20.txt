s which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions continue to be negative .
Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable .
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque N.M. reported they went so far as to take a cold fusion experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays .
A number of times they detected neutrons in one sometimes two of the three detectors but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors and they think that was a spurious event .
Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it .
In subsequent experiments one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time .
They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment .
At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted reported Philip Ross from the California laboratory .
Dow Jones & Co. announced Wall Street Journal advertising rates for 1990 .
The rates which take effect Jan. 2 include a 4 % increase for national edition advertising .
The Journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts .
The increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a 6.5 % increase in 1989 .
Newsprint and postage prices this year have not gone up said Peter R. Kann president of Dow Jones .
We have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without substantially increasing our costs .
Fundamental fairness and a sense of responsibility lead us to share operating efficiencies with our customers .
Advertising rates for the Eastern Midwest Western and Southwest editions will increase an average 5.5 % and rates for localized advertising editions will increase 7.5 % .
Rates for the Wall Street Journal Reports will remain unchanged .
A one-time noncontract full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal national edition will cost 99,385 .
Advertising rates for The Wall Street Journal\/Europe published in Brussels and printed in the Netherlands and Switzerland will increase 9 % .
Rates for The Asian Wall Street Journal published and printed in Hong Kong and also printed in Singapore and Tokyo will rise 8 % .
Rates for The Asian Wall Street Journal Weekly published in New York for North American readers will rise 6 % .
Dow Jones also publishes Barron 's magazine other periodicals and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services .

Reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending Texas Instruments Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 31 % and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier .
Net fell to 65 million or 67 cents a common share from 93.7 million or 1.03 a share a year ago .
Sales fell 2.5 % to 1.54 billion from 1.58 billion .
For the nine months the electronics and defense concern had net of 255.8 million or 2.70 a share down 5.6 % from 271 million or 3.01 a share in the year-ago period .
Sales were 4.66 billion up 1.3 % from 4.6 billion .
Jerry Junkins chairman president and chief executive officer said sluggish consumer-electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductors .
That coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher semiconductor-depreciation expense contributed to the decline in sales and profit .
In addition cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a 10 million charge to reduce the work force of Texas Instruments ' defense-electronics division also reduced net .
However the quarter results included 28 million in royalty income from patent licenses up from 21 million in the year-earlier period .
The nine months include 125 million of royalty income up from 98 million last year .
Mr. Junkins was n't optimistic about the short-term outlook hinting that further workforce reductions may be needed .
We expect near-term sluggishness in the electronics market he said and we will take ongoing cost-reduction actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand .
Further he said an internal reorganization to combine several divisions into the Information Technology Group is expected to affect fourth-quarter results by an undisclosed amount .
