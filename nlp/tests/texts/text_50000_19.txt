One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention .
The deportation of more than 315,000 men women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years .
Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century .
Today 's Turks in Bulgaria in other words deserve what is coming to them four centuries later .
As if this were n't enough the Senate Judiciary Committee is getting into the act .
On Tuesday it approved Senator Bob Dole 's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24 1990 as the National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923 suffered at the hands of the warring Ottoman Empire .
There can be no quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve .
It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey a country that has been one of America 's strongest allies in NATO .
The resolution also comes at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community .
Turkey has been fighting its past for years and thus far has been only partially successful .
Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people .
Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis .
Mr. Dole 's odd effort notwithstanding most of Turkey 's political problems lie with the Europeans .
Part of the problem some Europeans have with Turkey seems to stem from its location Turkey is n't really part of Europe .
Why they wonder should it belong to the EC .
Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people Turkey we are told is not a Christian nation its people simply wo n't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition .
It 's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire comes to the fore .
No one has to accept the sins of the Ottoman Empire to reject that argument .
Turkey in any event is long past it .
The country has in recent years accepted more than 500,000 refugees from at least four bordering nations .
Kurds suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of Syria Iran and Iraq have inundated eastern Turkey .
Now it is their fellow Turks arriving as refugees from Bulgaria .
The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently .
Surely the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten .
But what the Senate Judiciary Committee has done in supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories .
Congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists .
Bulgaria 's government has been behaving beyond the pale for months and the U.S. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past .
Many in Washington say President Bush will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs .
We have a better idea Dismantle HUD to pay for the war on drugs .
Housing and Urban Development 's budget is 17 billion .
From what we and the nation have been reading the money is n't being spent very well .
The single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods .
If that takes money take it away from this discredited federal department .
But of course the Democrats pillorying HUD in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind .
Instead they 're scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the HUD scandal .
This month HUD Secretary Jack Kemp unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at HUD .
No doubt many of his ideas are worthy but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently .
Congress is unlikely to go even that far .
Last week Secretary Kemp ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from House Banking Committee members .
They were appalled for instance that he wanted to target more of the 3 billion Community Development Block Grant CDBG program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious discretionary funds that have allowed HUD officials to steer contracts to political cronies .
These development grants mainly enrich developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking garages .
They also give those in Congress political credit for bringing home the pork and so they are popular with such Members as Mary Rose Oakar .
Rep. Oakar a Democrat from Cleveland wants a 6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .
She says it 'd create 600 jobs and bring Cleveland tourist revenue .
HUD says the project does n't qualify and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money .
At the hearing Rep. Oakar started wailing about phoney baloney regulations that would stand between her and housing for downtown Cleveland .
Rep. Chalmers Wylie an Ohio Republican rallied to the cause I think the gentlelady is making an important statement .
The implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there 's something wrong I think is most unfortunate .
We 're sure some theologian can explain the difference between what the Republican consultants have been doing with HUD and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want to do with HUD .
Our view is that given Congress 's attitude toward HUD the place probably is beyond reform .
For more than 50 years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities .
In the process HUD has wasted untold billions created slums and invited corruption .
Much of HUD 's spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class .
That includes the CDBG funds and the Federal Housing Administration which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be 4 billion in the hole .
Selling the FHA 's loan portfolio to the highest bidder would save the taxpayers untold billions in future losses .
Some HUD money actually does trickle down to the poor and zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units .
The rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the neighbhorhoods .
Rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones .
Even suburban Prince George 's County Md. reported last week there have been a record 96 killings there this year most of them drug-related .
Innocent bystanders often are the victims .
A man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a Miami drug battle .
A three-year-old Brooklyn boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer .
Decent life in the inner cities wo n't be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the drug gangs .
Until then the billions HUD spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted .
It 's still unclear whether Secretary Kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at HUD or just tighten a few screws here and there .
No doubt he believes the place can be salvaged .
Having seen the hypocrisy with which Congress has addressed the HUD scandals we disagree .
It 's time to scrap the politically infested spending machine HUD has become and channel the resources into the drug war .

Natural upheavals and most particularly earthquakes are not only horrible realities in and of themselves but also symbols through which the state of a society can be construed .
The rubble after the Armenian earthquake a year ago disclosed quite literally a city whose larger structures had been built with sand .
The extent of the disaster stemmed from years of chicanery and bureaucratic indifference .
The larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of San Francisco is surely with the state of the U.S. economy .
Did the stock-market tremors of Friday Oct. 13 presage larger fragility far greater upheavals .
Are the engineering and architecture of the economy as vulnerable as the spans of the Bay Bridge .
The eerie complacency of the Reagan-Bush era has produced Panglossian paeans about the present perfection of U.S. economic and social arrangements .
A licensed government intellectual Francis Fukuyama recently announced in The National Interest that history is so to speak at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of American civilization .
His observations were taken seriously .
But we are in reality witnessing the continuing decline of the political economy of capitalism not so much the end of history but the history of the end .
The financial equivalent of the sand used by those Armenian contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy-outs associated with them .
Builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it 's okay necessary even to look the other way .
And by the early 1980s U.S. capitalists had ample reason to welcome junk bonds to look the other way .
By that time they found extremely low profit rates from non-financial corporate investment .
Government statistics in fact show that the profit rate net pretax profits divided by capital stock peaked in 1965 at 17.2 % .
That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6 % in the recession year 1982 and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1 % in 1986 and 8 % in 1987 .
Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was in the early 1980s the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets the famous Q ratio associated with Prof. James Tobin .
In theory the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same .
But of course the market could decide that the firm 's capital stock its assets means nothing if the firm is not producing profits .
This is indeed what the market decided .
By 1982 the ratio was 43.5 % meaning that the market was valuing every dollar 's worth of the average firm 's assets at 43 cents .
From the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only 43 cents to buy a dollar 's worth of a firm 's capital stock an alert entrepreneur wo n't look the other way .
His assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits thus restoring the market 's faith in them .
Hence the LBO craze .
But here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way .
The profit rate is still low and the Q ratio was only 65 % in 1987 and 68.9 % in 1988 .
Result a landscape littered with lemons huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate America .
The mounting risks did not go unobserved even in the mid-1980s .
But there were enough promoters announcing the end of history in this case suspension of normal laws of economic gravity for society to continue shielding its eyes .
Mainstream economists and commentators craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs claimed the end result would be a leaner meaner corporate America with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall .
But this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found .
The beneficiaries were those financiers whose icon was the topic figure of '80s capitalism Michael Milken 's 517 million salary in one year .
Left-stream economists I associate with fellows in the Union of Radical Political Economists most particularly Robert Pollin of the economics faculty at the University of California at Riverside were not hypnotized in the manner of their pliant colleagues .
All along they have been noting the tremors and pointing out the underlying realities .
Profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher and now we have an extremely high-interest burden relative to cash flow .
The consequences of building empires with sand are showing up .
In contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at 2 % or 3 % a Harvard study published in April of this year and discussed in a lead story in The Wall Street Journal for Sept. 18 found the default rate on these junk bonds is 34 % .
What is the consequence of a high-interest burden high default rates and continued low profitability .
Corporations need liquidity in the form of borrowed funds .
Without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits they look to the government which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or bailouts .
The consequence can be inflation brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the deflationary shock of a sudden crash .
Attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort an assault on wages .
Mr. Fukuyama peering through binoculars at the end of history said in his essay that the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the West the egalitarianism of modern America represents the essential achievement of the classless society envisioned by Marx .
Mr. Fukuyama might want to consult some American workers on the subject of class and egalitarianism .
From its peak in 1972 of 198.41 the average American weekly wage had fallen to 169.28 in 1987 both figures being expressed in 1977 dollars .
In other words after the glory boom of the Reagan years wages had sunk from the post World War II peak by 16 % as capitalists helped by the government turned down the screws or went offshore .
But there are signs now the strikes by miners Boeing workers telephone workers etc. that this attack on wages is being more fiercely resisted .
These are long-term Richter readings on American capitalism .
The whole structure is extremely shaky .
Governments have become sophisticated in handling moments of panic a word the London Times forbade my father to use when he was reporting the Wall Street crash in 1929 .
But sophistication has its limits .
The S&L bailout could cost 300 billion computing interest on the government 's loans .
These are real costs .
Under what weights will the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation totter .
Capitalism may now be engineered to withstand sudden shocks but there are fault lines the crisis in profits the assault on wages the structural inequity of the system that make fools of those who claim that the future is here and that history is over .
Mr. Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation and LA Weekly .
Japan Air Lines Lufthansa German Airlines and Air France reportedly plan to form an international air-freight company this year a move that could further consolidate the industry .
Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground-cargo and air-cargo systems .
They reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion yen 140 million in the venture whose headquarters would be in France or West Germany .
The action follows Federal Express Corp. 's acquisition of Flying Tiger Line Inc. in August .
After that it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly said Cotton Daly director of cargo services for New York consulting firm Simat Helliesen & Eichner Inc .
Mr. Daly said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by Federal Express United Parcel Service of America Inc. and other fast-growing air-freight companies .
Many airlines are talking about cargo ventures and there have been rumors about such a tie between JAL and European airlines .
In Tokyo a JAL spokesman said he could n't confirm or deny the latest Japanese report .
But he said JAL is talking to Lufthansa and Air France about some sort of cargo venture .
It is just one of a number of strategies JAL has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in Europe after 1992 the deadline for ending trade barriers in the EC he said .
In Frankfurt a Lufthansa spokesman confirmed talks are under way but declined to comment .
A Lufthansa spokeswoman in Tokyo said the head of Lufthansa 's cargo operations had been in Toyko last week for talks with JAL .
In Paris Air France declined to comment .
Nothing is defined or signed at this point Mr. Daly said of the talks .
Whatever accord the three carriers reach he said he is skeptical it would create a separate airline .
If the three companies pool their air-freight businesses their clout would be considerable .
According to figures from the International Air Transport Association they carried a combined 1.8 million tons of freight last year .
Federal Express and Flying Tiger as separate companies carried a combined 2.6 million tons .
Air France and Lufthansa last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities .
They plan to increase cooperation in freight ground-handling and create a world-wide computer system to process cargo .
Other airlines would have access to the system they said and negotiations with partners were already under way .
Both European airlines operate extensive fleets of Boeing 747 freighters and 747 Combis aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck .
They currently have large orders for cargo planes .
Several airlines including Lufthansa JAL and Cathay Pacific Airways are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join Mr. Daly said .
JAL also has signaled it is looking for toeholds in Europe before the end of 1992 .
Last month the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from British Airways so it could funnel its passengers from London to other European destinations .
British Airways said it has n't received a proposal from JAL .
But last week there were air-traffic negotiations between the U.K. and Japan a likely first step to any commercial agreement between JAL and British Airways or another U.K. carrier .
Federal Paper Board Co. said it completed the previously announced purchase of Imperial Cup Corp. a closely held maker of paper cups based in Kenton Ohio .
Terms were n't disclosed .
Imperial Cup has annual sales of approximately 75 million .
Federal Paper Board sells paper and wood products .
In a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the California earthquake the Securities and Exchange Commission said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange to the American New York and Philadelphia stock exchanges and to the Chicago Board Options Exchange .
The decision which affects millions of dollars of trading positions was made late yesterday because the Pacific exchange 's options floor was shut down as a result of Tuesday 's earthquake .
The SEC faced with a major squeeze on options positions said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow .
SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the Pacific exchange guaranteeing the liquidity of the market .
Officials at the four exchanges said well over 50 traders from the Pacific exchange were taking flights from San Francisco late yesterday to the American New York and Philadelphia exchanges and to the CBOE where they would continue making markets in the Pacific-listed options .
The Big Board said carpenters quickly erected a new options floor to accomodate 40 traders from the Pacific exchange .
In addition specialists on the exchanges agreed to provide backup capital for market-making in Pacific exchange options traded on the exchanges .
Trading was light on the Pacific Stock Exchange yesterday with workers at the exchange 's main floor in San Francisco struggling to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage .
The most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading .
The Pacific exchange has options for 129 underlying stock issues including highly active Hilton Hotels Corp. which is listed on the Big Board .
Investors were concerned that they might be unable to exercise options that expire tomorrow .
But professionals said throughout the day that the shutdown would n't be a cause for alarm even if it were to persist for several days .
I 've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options because they are guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corp. said Michael Schwartz a senior registered options strategist at Oppenheimer & Co .
The SEC reassigned trading in the options however to allow investors to do more than simply exercise the options .
While the exchange 's equities floor in San Francisco remained open on a limited basis orders were being routed and executed in Los Angeles .
Workers could dial out but they could n't receive telephone calls .
It 's a very uncertain situation right now said Navin Vyas administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange which has daily volume of about 10 million shares .
Because the exchange 's computer was rerouting orders to the exchange 's trading operations in Los Angeles business is as usual Mr. Vyas said .
If one city is down the other can take over .
Meanwhile the brokerage firms in San Francisco were trying to cope .
Charles Daggs chairman and chief executive officer of Sutro & Co. said traders came to work at 5 a.m. PDT many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company 's two main facilities there .
That should happen by today he said .
Traders worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of incoming phone calls .
Also most of the telecommunications equipment was out .
The traders were executing municipal bond mutual fund and other orders through a sister firm Tucker Anthony Inc. which is also owned by John Hancock Freedom Securities but is based in New York .
We are having a regular day .
Volume is down out of San Francisco but not out of the 11 outlying offices Mr. Daggs added .
Sutro 's Oakland office executed orders through the Sacramento office which was n't affected by the quake .
Others like Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. which has eight offices in the San Francisco area set up an 800 number yesterday morning for customers to obtain market commentary and other help .
At Kidder Peabody & Co. 's Sacramento branch Manager Janet White received calls yesterday morning from workers in San Francisco who offered to work in Sacramento .
Then she discovered that Quotron Systems Inc. 's Sacramento lines were down because they are normally tied in through a system that goes through San Francisco .
So the Kidder brokers had to call other company offices to get quotes on stocks .
At Quotron the company 's National Call-In Center which swung into action for the first time last month for Hurricane Hugo assembled a tactical team at 5 a.m. yesterday to begin rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders .
The company dispatched as many as 200 people in the San Francisco area to do the work though most of the rerouting was done by computer .
Service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown San Francisco while just parts of Oakland and San Jose were knocked out .
But Dale Irvine director of the emergency center said service was being restored to outlying San Francisco areas .
In Chicago yesterday Options Clearing confirmed that it guarantees the Pacific exchange options .
The firm also will permit its members and the public to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the Pacific exchange even if the exchange is closed said Wayne Luthringshausen chairman of Options Clearing .
Put options give holders the right but not the obligation to sell a financial instrument at a specified price while call options give holders the right but not the obligation to buy a financial instrument at a specified price .
Investors and traders in Pacific exchange options are protected to the extent that they can convert their put and call options into the underlying instrument Mr. Luthringshausen said .
We are seeing such exercises today in fact .
International Business Machines Corp. said its board approved the purchase of 1 billion of its common shares a move that should help support its battered stock .
Even as the stock market has generally done well this year IBM 's shares have slipped steadily from its 52-week high of 130.875 .
Yesterday 's closing price of 101.75 down 50 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange puts the stock at about 1 1\/2 times book value which is as low as it has sunk over the past decade .
The announcement came after the market 's close .
The move by IBM was n't exactly a surprise .
The company has spent some 5 billion over the past 3 1\/2 years to buy back 42 million common shares or roughly 7 % of those outstanding .
In addition despite IBM 's well-publicized recent problems the computer giant still generates enormous amounts of cash .
As of the end of the second quarter it had 4.47 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand .
As a result some securities analysts had predicted in recent days that IBM would authorize additional purchases .
In Armonk N.Y. a spokesman said that although IBM did n't view its spending as necessarily a way to support the stock it thought the purchases were a good way to improve such financial measurements as per-share earnings and return on equity .
We view it as a good long-term investment the spokesman said .
In the short term the move is likely to have little effect .
At yesterday 's closing price 1 billion would buy back about 10 million shares or less than 2 % of the roughly 580 million outstanding .
In addition as of Sept. 30 the company still had authorization to buy 368 million of stock under a prior repurchase program .
Over the long term however IBM 's stock repurchases along with its hefty 4.84-a-share annual dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional investors are providing a floor for the stock price .
Although IBM last year produced its first strong results in four years and was expected to continue to roll this year it began faltering as early as January .
First it had trouble manufacturing a chip for its mainframes IBM 's bread-and-butter business .
Then it had a series of smaller glitches including problems manufacturing certain personal computers and the delay in the announcement of some important workstations .
Finally IBM had to delay the introduction of some high-end disk drives which account for 10 % of its 60 billion of annual revenue .
None of the problems is necessarily fatal and they are n't all necessarily even related .
There are also other factors at work that are outside IBM 's control such as currency exchange rates .
The strong dollar which reduces the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they are translated into dollars is expected to knock 80 to 85 cents off IBM 's per-share earnings for the full year .
Without that problem IBM might have matched last year 's earnings of 5.81 billion or 9.80 a share .
Still investors will take some convincing before they get back into IBM 's stock in a big way .
Steve Milunovich a securities analyst at First Boston said that while investors were looking for an excuse to buy IBM shares a year ago even the big institutional investors are looking for a reason to avoid the stock these days .
On Wall Street yesterday northern California 's killer earthquake was just another chance to make a buck .
At the opening bell investors quickly began singling out shares of companies expected to profit or suffer in some way from the California disaster including insurers construction-related companies refiners and housing lenders .
Brokerage houses jumped in touting post-quake demand stocks and Kidder Peabody & Co. set up a toll-free hot line for San Franciscans who might need emergency investment advice and help in transferring funds .
Wall Street thinks of everything in terms of money says Tom Gallagher a senior Oppenheimer & Co. trader .
However he added such event-driven trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information .
The most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as General Re Corp. which rose 2.75 to 86.50 Nac Re Corp. up 2 to 37.75 American International Group Inc. up 3.25 to 102.625 and Cigna Corp. up 87.5 cents to 62.50 .
Yesterday the brokerage firm Conning & Co. said insurers will use the earthquake as an excuse to raise insurance rates ending their long price wars .
Before this bullish theory surfaced some insurance stocks initially fell indicating that investors thought the quake might cost insurers a lot of money .
In fact Fireman 's Fund Corp. which ended the day off 50 cents to 36.50 said earthquake damage would slightly hurt fourth-quarter profit .
On the prospect for rebuilding northern California investors bid up cement-makers Calmat Co. up 2.75 to 28.75 and Lone Star Industries Inc. up 1.75 to 29.25 .
Bridge and road builders had a field day including Kasler Corp. up 2.125 to 9.875 Guy F. Atkinson Co. up 87.5 to 61.875 and Morrison Knudsen Corp. which reported higher third-quarter earnings yesterday up 2.25 to 44.125 .
Fluor Corp. a construction engineering firm gained 75 cents to 33.375 .

Timber stocks got a big boost .
Georgia Pacific Corp. up 1.25 to 58 and Maxxam Inc. up 3 to 43.75 both reported strong profits .
Merrill Lynch & Co. touted Georgia-Pacific Louisiana Pacific Corp. and Willamette Industries Inc. as the best post-quake plywood plays .
Other gainers were companies with one or more undamaged California refineries .
Tosco Corp. jumped 1.125 to 20.125 and Chevron Corp. despite a temporary pipeline shutdown rose 1 to 65 .
Meanwhile shares of some big housing lenders got hit on the likelihood that the lenders ' collateral people 's homes suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in value .
Wells Fargo & Co. fell 50 cents to 81.50 and BankAmerica Corp. fell 50 cents to 31.875 .
Some California thrift stocks also fell including Golden West Financial Corp. and H.F. Ahmanson & Co. which reported lower earnings yesterday .
Property values did n't go up in California yesterday says one money manager .
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. fell 37.5 cents to 19.625 .
One of its power generators was damaged though the company said there wo n't be any financial impact .
Pacific Telesis Group lost 62.5 cents to 44.625 .
A computer failure delayed its earnings announcement and some investors think it might have extra costs to repair damaged telephone lines .
Heavy construction property-casualty insurance and forest products were among the best performing industry groups in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index yesterday .
Friday 's stock market plunge claimed its second victim among the scores of futures and options trading firms here .
Petco Options an options trading firm owned by the family of the deceased former Chicago Board of Trade chairman Ralph Peters is getting out of the trade clearing or processing and guaranteeing business after sustaining a multimillion dollar loss Friday options industry officials said .
Nearly 75 options traders on the Chicago Board Options Exchange who cleared trades through Petco including a handful of traders who lost between 500,000 to 1 million themselves as a result of Friday 's debacle are trying to transfer their business to other clearing firms CBOE members said .
Timothy Vincent Petco chief executive officer confirmed that Petco was withdrawing from the clearing business .
The owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business and after Monday they felt they did n't want to be exposed any more he said .
He added that Petco remained in compliance with all industry capital requirements during the market 's rapid plunge Friday and Monday 's rebound .
A CBOE spokeswoman declined comment on Petco .
Over the weekend Fossett Corp. another options trading firm transferred the clearing accounts of about 160 traders to First Options of Chicago a unit of Continental Bank Corp. because it could n't meet regulatory capital requirements after Friday 's market slide .
The unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry 's desire not to have its credibility tarnished by potentially widespread trading defaults on Monday .
The CBOE American Stock Exchange Options Clearing Corp. and Stephen Fossett owner of Fossett joined in putting up 50 million to guarantee the accounts at First Options .
The head of another small options clearing firm who asked not to be identified said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business .
Prior to the introduction of financial futures in the late 1970s most trading firms clustered around the LaSalle Street financial district here were family operations handed down from one generation to the next .
Most also were relatively undercapitalized compared with the size of most Wall Street securities firms .
Mr. Peters a LaSalle Street legend among the post-World War II generation of commodity traders was rumored to have amassed a multimillion-dollar fortune from commodity trading and other activities by the time he died in May .
Part of a Series Betty Lombardi is a mild-mannered homemaker and grandmother in rural Hunterdon County N.J .
But put her behind a shopping cart and she turns ruthless .
If Colgate toothpaste offers a tempting money-saving coupon she 'll cross Crest off her shopping list without a second thought .
Never mind that her husband prefers Crest .
Some weeks when her supermarket runs a double-coupon promotion she boasts that she shaves 22 off her bill .
Money is n't the only thing that makes her dump once favorite brands .
After she heard about the artery-clogging hazards of tropical oils in many cookies she dropped Pepperidge Farm and started buying brands free of such oils .
I always thought Pepperidge Farm was tasty and high quality Mrs. Lombardi says .
But I do n't want any of that oil for my grandkids .
Pepperidge Farm says it ca n't tell exactly how many customers it has lost but it hopes to remove the objectionable tropical oil from all its products by year end .
Clearly people like Mrs. Lombardi are giving marketers fits .
She represents a new breed of savvy consumer who puts bargain prices nutritional and environmental concerns and other priorities ahead of old-fashioned brand loyalty .
While brand loyalty is far from dead marketing experts say it has eroded during the 1980s .
Marketers themselves are partly to blame They 've increased spending for coupons and other short-term promotions at the expense of image-building advertising .
What 's more a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands many of which are virtually carbon copies of one other .
Marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use of promotions contends Joe Plummer an executive vice president at the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles ad agency .
Without some real product improvements it 's going to be difficult to win that loyalty back .
The Wall Street Journal 's American Way of Buying survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products they use .
For the survey Peter D. Hart Research Associates asked some 2,000 consumers including Mrs. Lombardi whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty .
More than half the users of 17 of the 25 products included in the survey said they 're brand switchers .
Overall 12 % of consumers are n't brand loyal for any of the 25 product categories .
About 47 % are loyal for one to five of the products .
Only 2 % are brand loyal in 16 to 20 of the categories and no one is loyal for more than 20 types of products .
For such products as canned vegetables and athletic shoes devotion to a single brand was quite low with fewer than 30 % saying they usually buy the same brand .
Only for cigarettes mayonnaise and toothpaste did more than 60 % of users say they typically stick with the same brand .
People tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive flavors such as cigarettes and ketchup .
Kathie Huff a respondent in the Journal survey from Spokane Wash. says her husband is adamant about eating only Hunt 's ketchup .
He simply ca n't stomach the taste of Heinz she says .
The 31-year-old homemaker adds The only other thing I 'm really loyal to is my Virginia Slims cigarettes .
Coke and Pepsi are all the same to me and I usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale .
Brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes perfume and beer .
People often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image its advertising conveys whether that 's macho Marlboro cigarettes or Cher 's Uninhibited perfume .
Loyalty lags most for utilitarian products like trash bags and batteries .
Only 23 % of trash-bag users in the Journal survey usually buy the same brand and just 29 % of battery buyers stick to one brand .
Underwear scored a middling 36 % in brand loyalty but consumer researchers say that 's actually quite high for such a mundane product .
In the past you just wore Fruit of the Loom and did n't care says Peter Kim U.S. director of consumer behavior research for the J. Walter Thompson ad agency .
The high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women .
He believes there 's opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty .
What loyalty there is to gas brands he believes is a matter of stopping at the most conveniently located service stations .
Brand loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the Journal survey .
Nearly one-fourth of participants age 60 and older claim brand loyalty for more than 10 of the 25 products in the survey only 9 % of those age 18 to 29 have such strong allegiance .
Higher-income people also tend to be more brand loyal these days the Journal survey and other research studies indicate .
Marketers speculate that more affluent people tend to lead more pressured lives and do n't have time to research the products they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price .
An established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality if not always the best value for the money .
It 's sort of loyalty by default .
Meanwhile the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal says Laurel Cutler vice chairman of the ad agency FCB\/Leber Katz Partners .
They 're buying whatever 's cheaper .
The biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game How those hotly pursued but highly unpredictable baby boomers will behave as they move into middle age .
They grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less allegiance so far .
But now that they 're settling down and raising families might they also show more stability in their brand choices .
Mr. Kim of J. Walter Thompson does n't think so .
He believes baby boomers will continue to be selective in their brand loyalties .
Earlier generations were brand loyal across categories he says but boomers tend to be brand loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled water but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances .
While not as brand loyal as in the past consumers today do n't buy products capriciously either .
Rather they tend to have a set of two or three favorites .
Sometimes they 'll choose Ragu spaghetti sauce other times it will be Prego .
Advertisers attribute this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands .
If a more absorbent Pampers hits the market you can be sure a new and improved Huggies wo n't be far behind .
The BBDO Worldwide ad agency studied brand parity and found that consumers believe all brands are about the same in a number of categories particularly credit cards paper towels dry soups and snack chips .
When there 's a clutter of brands consumers simplify the complexity by telling themselves All brands are the same so what difference does it make which I buy says Karen Olshan a senior vice president at BBDO .
Too often advertising imagery has n't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer .
But given such strong brand disloyalty some marketers are putting renewed emphasis on image advertising .
A small but growing number of companies are also trying to instill more fervent brand loyalty through such personalized direct-marketing ploys as catalogs magazines and membership clubs for brand users .
While discount promotions are essential for most brands some companies concede they went overboard in shifting money from advertising to coupons refunds and other sales incentives .
Some people argue that strong brands can afford to stop advertising for a time because of the residual impact of hundreds of millions of dollars spent on advertising through the years .
But most companies are too afraid to take that chance .
And perhaps with good reason .
Says Clayt Wilhite president of the D'Arcy Masius ad agency 's U.S. division Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly even for a powerful brand like Budweiser .
Consider for example what happened to Maxwell House coffee .
The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business .
But since returning to advertising Maxwell House has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival Folgers .
Now Philip Morris Kraft General Foods ' parent company is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House says Dick Mayer president of the General Foods USA division .
Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it .
Campbell Soup Co. for one has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands .
The probability of converting a non-user to your brand is about three in 1,000 says Tony Adams the company 's vice president for marketing research .
The best odds are with your core franchise .
Our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week and we 'd like to increase that .
So Campbell is talking to its brand enthusiasts probing their psychological attachment to its soup .
In one consumer focus group a fan declared that Campbell 's soup is like getting a hug from a friend .
That helped persuade the company to introduce a new advertising slogan A warm hug from Campbell 's .
Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week 's California earthquake .
Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month .
The earthquake 's toll including possible deep structural damage goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane says George Reider a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's claims division .
But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake coming so soon after the hurricane will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers .
Reflecting that logic insurance-company stocks posted strong gains .
Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage .
Most insurers already have mobilized their catastrophe teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern California .
Since commercial air travel is interrupted Aetna based in Hartford Conn. chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area .
About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon along with laptop computers cellular phones and blank checks .
Some adjusters already in other parts of California drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers .
Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers probably on the radio that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims .
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. the largest home and auto insurer in California believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the 475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo .
State Farm based in Bloomington Ind. is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California .
Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement rider on a homeowner 's policy in California because of the area 's vulnerability to earthquakes .
State Farm said about 25 % of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance .
Allstate Insurance Co. a unit of Sears Roebuck & Co. said about 23 % of its personal property policyholders about 28 % in the San Franciso area also have earthquake coverage .
The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated damage to residential property could total 500 million but only 100 million to 150 million is insured it said .
Officials from the American Insurance Association 's property-claim service division which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster will be flying to San Francisco today .
They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two .
Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage .
Highways such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland generally do n't have insurance coverage .
Industry officials say the Bay Bridge unlike some bridges has no earthquake coverage either so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds .
However the bridge which charges a 1 toll each way does have loss of income insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days .
That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman 's Fund Corp. based in Novato Calif. and Cigna Corp. based in Philadelphia .
Earthquake-related claims are n't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole .
Instead even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks analysts said the total capital of t
