The Federal Trade Commission ruled that five major title-insurance companies illegally fixed prices for title search-and-examination services by participating in joint rating bureaus in six states .

John Christie a lawyer here for the two Chicago Title & Trust units accused the FTC of second-guessing state-level regulations with which he said his clients had complied .
I expect all the companies to appeal he added .

First they get us to buy computers so we can get more information .
Then the computers give us more information than we can ever read .
Now they plan to sell us products that sift through all the information to give us what we really want to know .
The products range from computer-edited personal newsletters to systems that sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires .
Filtered news is what people want says Esther Dyson editor of Release 1.0 an industry newsletter that spots new developments .
Most people read 10 times more than necessary in order to find out what they really need .
Geoffrey Goodfellow who dropped out of high school back in the 1970s to manage a computer network at a California research firm says Old network hands have started to turn off the network because they do n't have time to wade through the muck .
Mr. Goodfellow has started a Menlo Park Calif. company called Anterior Technology that provides human editors for public electronic networks .
I see it as a sewage treatment plant he says .
A new product NewsEdge carries five business news wires simultaneously into a user 's computer and beeps and flashes whenever an article appears that is of interest to the user .
The product developed by Desktop Data Corp. a new company based in Waltham Mass. scans the wires looking for articles that contain key words specified by the user .
One early user David Semmel a Chicago venture capitalist and investor in Desktop Data says he uses it to track takeover developments .
He says he told NewsEdge to look for stories containing such words as takeover acquisition acquire LBO tender merger junk and halted .
I 'm pretty confident I 'm catching everything he says .
NewsEdge is pricey 7,500 a year for a limited version 40,000 a year if the cost of all the news wires is included .
And it works best in high-powered personal computers .
But some investors and consultants who have tried it are enthusiastic .
Jeffrey Tarter editor of SoftLetter a Watertown Mass. industry newsletter says I 've seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering information .
This is the first time I 've seen something I could imagine a lot of people using .
NewsEdge uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by Reuters McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones & Co. as well as PR Newswire which carries corporate press releases .
An FM receiver attached to a user 's personal computer receives the information .
Some organizations have devised their own systems to sort through news wire items as they come in .
George Goodwin an account manager at Royal Bank of Canada adapted a Lotus Development Corp. program called Agenda to sort through international news wires .
It automatically selects stories from particular countries for reading by the international bankers responsible for lending in those areas .
For those who do n't need their personalized information moment by moment some services are offering overnight newsletters .
Individual Inc. a new company in Brookline Mass. uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton to automatically produce customized newsletters it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m. the next day .
We are operating an information refinery that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge says Yosi Amram founder and president .
The daily newsletter which is n't widely available yet will have a base cost of 2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters McGraw Hill United Press International two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service .
One early user is NEC Corp. 's U.S. printer marketing arm .
They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition Mr. Amram says .
It also tracks personnel and financial announcements by NEC 's distributors and customers .
Individual Inc. 's technology goes beyond word searches by using a computerized thesaurus .
If a customer asks for stories about IBM the computer will also supply stories that mention I.B.M. International Business Machines or Big Blue Mr. Amram says .
Moreover Individual Inc. 's computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber 's interest area .
It compares the position of key words in the story words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value .
And it calculates how often the words appear in the story compared with how often they appear in the entire data base .
The higher the ratio of hits to total words the higher the presumed value to the reader .
Pinpoint Information Corp. Chantilly Va. a producer of 1,800-a-year personalized newsletters about the computer industry that started full operation last month relies on 12 human readers to code news releases by topic in order to select items for each subscriber .
The computers find all the key words they can but the editors confirm every one .
Computer picking is n't perfect says Harvey Golomb president and founder of Pinpoint .
The humans also write abstracts of articles from some 200 computer industry publications .
Once all the articles are coded and put in a data base Pinpoint 's computers pick the most relevant for each subscriber and lay them out in a three-to-five-page newsletter format each newsletter is sent directly from the computer to the subscriber 's fax machine .
Mr. Golomb says each of his computers can produce and send about 75 unique newsletters a night .
Many computer network users who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically .
So-called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos gossip technical data schedules and directives distributed over local and national computer networks .
All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what 's junk and what 's important says Chuck Digate a former Lotus Development executive who has started a new company to cope with the problem .
Mr. Digate says his firm Beyond Inc. has licensed technology known as Information Lens from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and plans to develop it for commercial use .
The MIT project devised ways for E-mail to be automatically categorized as top priority if it comes from certain designated senders or requires action in the next couple of days .
Mr. Digate says that Beyond will refine the product so the message will be smart enough to know to come back and bother you again next week .
And if a user is busy he can set it for crisis mode Do n't bother me with reports until Monday .
A program called Notes which is under development by Lotus also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work groups .
One thing that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same .
Notes which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail .
A daily news briefing from the company librarian for example would have a distinctive format on the screen just as a paper version would have .
With E-mail you do n't have the visual clues of paper says Mr. Tarter the editor of SoftLetter .
With Notes they 're visually distinct .
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. lost its second recent arbitration case involving a former bond-trading executive .
A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel ordered Dean Witter to pay 404,294 in back bonuses to William Kelly the company 's former head of high-yield high-risk junk-bond trading and sales .
It also awarded 196,785 in back bonuses to former trader Michael Newcomb and 69,105 in fees to the two men 's attorneys .
The sums awarded to Messrs. Kelly and Newcomb represent bonuses the two men said they deserved from the first half of 1988 but which were n't paid because of a dispute over an incentive contract .
Jeffrey L. Liddle the two men 's attorney at Liddle O'Connor Finkelstein & Robinson said Mr. Kelly began working at Dean Witter in 1987 .
Mr. Kelly built the company 's high-yield bond group which has been a minor player in the junk-bond arena .
Dean Witter lost a separate case involving a former bond executive earlier this year in August it paid 666,666 in back pay and a bonus to a former corporate-bond trading chief Harold Bachman .
That award ended a dispute between Dean Witter and Mr. Bachman over who was responsible for certain bond-trading losses around the time of the 1987 stock-market crash .
A spokesman for Dean Witter a unit of Sears Roebuck & Co. declined to comment .
DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES Inc. said it offered 50 million of 9 1\/2 % debentures due 2001 at par .

The company which also has businesses in life insurance office products and hardware and home-improvement products said net income rose to 166.4 million or 1.71 a share from 146.8 million or 1.53 a share a year earlier .
Year-earlier results for the quarter and the nine months were restated to reflect a change in accounting standards .

WASHINGTON LIES LOW after the stock market 's roller-coaster ride .
Lawmakers haunted by charges that some of their comments contributed to the 1987 crash generally shy away from calls for sweeping new legislation .
But a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee will quiz SEC Chairman Breeden Wednesday and Treasury Secretary Brady will go before the Senate Banking panel Thursday .
The market 's wild week may speed along the market-reform legislation that has been pending for months in the aftermath of the 1987 crash .
It may also expedite the SEC 's modest pending changes in junk-bond disclosure rules and intensify the Treasury 's look at plans for giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short-term trades by pension funds .
Brady and Breeden work well together on the plunge despite the fact that the Treasury secretary opposed Breeden 's nomination to the SEC post .
BAKER FALTERS in the Mideast amid Israeli paralysis and Palestinian politics .
Despite seeing his plan for Israeli-Palestinian elections wither the cautious secretary of state is so far unwilling to cut U.S. economic or military aid to force Israeli cooperation .
Baker nonetheless remains furious both at Shamir for backing down on the elections and at Shamir 's rival Peres for political ineptitude in forcing a premature cabinet vote on Baker 's plan .

DARMAN'S MANEUVERS on the budget and capital gains hurt him in Congress .
Republicans as well as Democrats were angered by the budget director 's rejection of Speaker Foley 's effort to expedite a deficitcutting measure by stripping it of the capital-gains tax cut as well as pet Democratic projects .
Darman now blames the clash on miscommunication but House GOP leader Michel who carried the offer to him observes I was speaking English at the time and quite loud so I could be understood .
Senate GOP leader Dole ridicules the budget chief on the Senate floor .
Democratic counterpart Mitchell asked to interpret Darman 's threat to make permanent the across-the-board Gramm-Rudman cuts that took effect this week says I do n't even bother to interpret them .
But Darman suggests such tensions will dissipate quickly .
If I can show signs of maturity almost anybody can he jokes .

Ever since the hotly contested America 's Cup race last year the famous yachting match has run into more rough sailing out of the water than in it .
Now that a key member of the San Diego Yacht Club team is splitting off to form his own team even more competition lies ahead .
Peter Isler the winning navigator in the past two America 's Cup challenges has split from the team led by Dennis Conner skipper of the victorious Stars & Stripes to form his own team for the next contest in 1992 .
And in addition to a crack team of sailors Mr. Isler has lined up some real brass to help him finance the syndicate .
Isler Sailing International 's advisory board includes Ted Turner Turner Broadcasting chairman and a former Cup victor Peter G. Diamandis head of Diamandis Communications and Joseph B. Vittoria chairman and chief executive of Avis Inc .
His steering committee includes other notable businessmen including the California investor and old salt Roy E. Disney .
We have the structure people and plan Mr. Isler said in a statement .
Now the first order of business is raising enough money to keep his team afloat a new yacht will cost about 3 million alone and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to 25 million for a Cup challenge .
The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the San Diego Yacht Club should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the New Zealand challengers ' 90-foot monohull .
In September a New York appellate court overturned a state judge 's ruling that awarded the Cup to the New Zealand team .
Pending an appeal by the New Zealand team led by Michael Fay the finals for the next Cup challenge are scheduled to be held in mid-1992 in San Diego .
But because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the suit Mr. Conner 's team has done little to begin gearing up to defend its title .
If you do n't know what the rules of the game are it 's hard to start your fund-raising or design said Dana Smith an official with Team Dennis Conner .
The Conner team wo n't be able to negotiate with corporate sponsors until the suit is resolved and the race site is determined Mr. Smith said and the syndicate 's budget could easily reach 30 million .
But spokesmen for both Mr. Isler and Mr. Conner say the formation of the new syndicate has to do with Mr. Isler 's desire to skipper his own team and begin planning now rather than any falling out between the two sportsmen .
Mr. Smith and a spokesman for the America 's Cup Organizing Committee insist that the added competition for the defender 's spot will only improve the race .
Missouri farmer Blake Hurst writing in the fall issue of the Heritage Foundation 's Policy Review about the proposed location of a hazardous-waste incinerator in his county Of course I 'd rather have a computer software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator .
But I 'd also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms I 've seen and smelt in these parts .
An incinerator is also probably better than having nobody next door on our farm there are four unoccupied houses .
On my four-mile drive to farm headquarters each morning I drive by another four empty houses .
A community of abandoned farmsteads failing businesses and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one .
The loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural Missouri is hardly of national importance except for this If the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem can not be built in Atchinson County what hope have we for dealing with the wastes our economy produces .
After all farmers here work with hazardous chemicals every day many of them the same chemicals that would have been destroyed in the incinerator .
We know they are dangerous but if handled with care their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment .
Just because Stamford Conn. High School did nothing when its valuable 1930s mural was thrown in the trash does n't mean the city no longer owns the work of art a federal judge ruled .
The mural now valued at 1.3 million according to appraisers was tossed in a trash heap in 1971 by workers who were renovating the building .
The 100-foot-long mural painted by James Daugherty in 1934 was commissioned by the federal Works Project Administration .
After the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned Stamford graduate it eventually was turned over to Hiram Hoelzer a professional art restorer .
Throughout the 1970s Stamford school and city officials made no effort to locate the mural .
Apparently the officials did n't even know the mural was missing until 1980 when a researcher found that the painting was in Mr. Hoelzer 's studio and questioned school officials about it .
In 1986 Stamford officials thanked Mr. Hoelzer for taking care of the mural and demanded he return it as soon as possible .
Mr. Hoelzer however sued Stamford claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long to reclaim it .
But Judge Louis L. Stanton of federal court in Manhattan ruled that the city could n't be faulted for waiting too long because it did n't realize until 1986 that its ownership of the painting was in dispute .
The judge also ruled that the painting was n't abandoned because officials did n't intend for it to be thrown away and were unaware that the workmen had discarded it .
Mr. Hoelzer did n't return phone calls seeking comment on the judge 's decision .
The judge ordered that a hearing be held Nov. 17 to determine how much the city should pay Mr. Hoelzer for his services .
Mary E. Sommer corporate counsel for Stamford said the city has discussed several possible plans for displaying the mural which portrays various scenes from the Great Depression .
She said the mural preserves an era in Stamford and in our country when this type of work was being done .
The prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the Soviet Union is keeping up its dizzying October buying binge of U.S. corn .
Those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the U.S. Agriculture Department announced that the Soviets had bought 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn bringing their U.S. corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons .
In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade the corn contract for December delivery jumped 5.75 cents a bushel to settle at 2.44 a bushel .
The Soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected the Soviet Union to buy this fall the season in which it usually buys much of the corn it imports from the U.S. .
That pace is causing some analysts to speculate that the Soviet Union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons .
One sign that more Soviet purchases are possible is that U.S. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts .
That sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn .
By some estimates several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn .
By buying futures contracts these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver .
Rumors of Soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts .
Among other things the Agriculture Department is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the Soviet Union .
On top of all this corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the Midwest harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of Indiana and Ohio .
The harvest delays however are expected to be temporary .
Balmy temperatures are forecast for next week said Robert Lekberg an analyst at Farmers Grain & Livestock Corp. Chicago .
Many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently harvested crop to grain elevator companies .
The heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally .
Wheat futures prices rose slightly .
In other commodity markets yesterday PRECIOUS METALS Futures prices declined .
A number of developments were negatively interpreted by traders .
December delivery gold fell 1.80 an ounce to 370.60 .
December silver eased 2.7 cents an ounce to 5.133 .
January platinum was down 3.60 an ounce at 491.10 .
