than the 15 % control that had been earmarked for British Air .
One option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period .
Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort at least temporarily and to return to running the company full time .
The board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale .
The labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board .
However the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis who triggered the buy-out with a 5.4 billion bid in early August is hanging back apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse .
Three top advisers to Mr. Davis visited New York late last week at least in part to confer with executives at Citicorp .
Mr. Davis had paid 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid .
But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group .
On Friday British Air issued a statement saying it does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future .
However several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out .
Also late last week UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer .
But the machinists union whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor .
One advantage the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make 200 million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid .
Speculation has also arisen that the UAL executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing chief financial officer John Pope may come under pressure to resign .
However people familiar with the buy-out group said Mr. Pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time .
Despite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing UAL remains obligated to pay 26.7 million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers Lazard Freres & Co. Salomon Brothers Inc. and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .
