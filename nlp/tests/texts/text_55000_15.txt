posed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the viewpoints of the state 's citizens .
As a result GOP state Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County the legislature 's leading foe of abortion has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and he hopes to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place .
The Freind legislation the state 's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy except to avert the death of the mother .
Mr. Freind calculates that the provision which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established will make it necessary for the Supreme Court to review Roe and perhaps to overturn it .
But the Pennsylvania measure also includes an informed consent provision that may become widely imitated by abortion foes who want to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves .
Under this legislation a woman must be informed 24 hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks .
Regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion Mr. Freind argues it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which one way or the other might remain with her for the rest of her life .
In Michigan where the state Senate is expected to approve parental-consent legislation by the end of next week Gov. Blanchard is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists .
Susan Rogin a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state takes comfort from the fact that the state 's House abortion opponents have n't been able to muster the votes to overturn a veto on abortion in 16 years .
But proponents believe they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents ' rights .
In Illinois lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on fetuses at 20 weeks to determine their gestational age weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that if fetuses survive an abortion a second doctor must be on hand to help it survive .
The legislation failed by one vote to clear the House Rules Committee Tuesday but anti-abortionists still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this fall .
Pamela Sutherland executive director of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council says she and her allies are cautiously optimistic they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote .
Abortion foes in Wisconsin meanwhile expect a parental-consent bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early November and are hopeful of prevailing in both houses by next March .
In Texas abortion opponents want to pass parental-consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds personnel and facilities for abortion and viability tests for fetuses 19 weeks and older .
The anti-abortionists are urging GOP Gov. Bill Clements to press the issues in a special session scheduled to run Nov. 14 to Dec. 13 .
The prognosis is only fair says Kathie Roberts administrative director of the Texas Right to Life Committee .
Next year is an election year and the legislators just do n't want to do anything about this now .
This legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new mobilization efforts plunging into gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey and girding for next autumn 's state elections .
At the same time abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy deciding to move on what Jacki Ragan the National Right to Life Committee 's director of state organizational development calls reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of Americans support .
These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection and the public funding of alternatives for abortion .
Those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves pro-choice rather than pro-abortion says Mary Spaulding the group 's associate state legislative coordinator .
Over the weekend the National Abortion Rights Action League singled out eight politicians including Pennsylvania 's Mr. Freind as 1990 targets and held a Washington seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures .
We now see pro-choice legislators going on the offensive for the first time says Kate Michelman executive director of the group .

Congress sent President Bush an 18.4 billion fiscal 1990 Treasury and Postal Service bill providing 5.5 billion for the Internal Revenue Service and increasing the Customs Service 's air-interdiction program nearly a third .
Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the Senate and the swift passage contrasted with months of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special-interest provisions for both members and the executive branch .
An estimated 33 million was added for university and science grants including 1.5 million for Smith College .
And Southwest lawmakers were a driving force behind 54.6 million for U.S.-Mexico border facilities or more than double the administration 's request .
More than 1.8 million is allocated for pensions and expenses for former presidents and the budget for the official residence of Vice President Quayle is more than doubled with 200,000 designated for improvements to the property .
Even the Office of Management and Budget is remembered with an extra 1 million to help offset pay costs that other government departments are being asked to absorb .
Within the IRS nearly 1.95 billion is provided for processing tax returns a 12 % increase over fiscal 1989 and double what the government was spending five years ago .
Investigation and taxpayer service accounts would grow to 1.6 billion and Congress specifically added 7.4 million for stepped up criminal investigations of money laundering related to drug traffic .
The large increase in Customs Service air-interdiction funds is also intended to counter smuggling and the annual appropriations level has more than quadrupled in five years .
The 196.7 million provided for fiscal 1990 anticipates the purchase of a Lockheed P-3 surveillance aircraft and five Cessna Citation II jets .
Despite administration reservations the plan has had the quiet backing of customs officials as well as influential lawmakers from Cessna 's home state Kansas .
Among legislative provisions attached to the bill is a ban on any Treasury Department expenditure for enforcement of a 1986 tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee-benefit plans .
Small-business interests have lobbied against the so-called Section 89 tax rules .

In a separate development a private meeting is scheduled this morning between House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten D. Miss .
and Sen. Dale Bumpers D. Ark .
in an effort to end a dispute which for two weeks has delayed action on an estimated 44 billion agriculture bill .
A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides .
The program 's nonprofit sponsors received 900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990 .
The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use but as a master of pork-barrel politics he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a Tennessee center near Memphis and the northern Mississippi border .

B.A.T Industries PLC may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan including the sale of its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field units in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets company officials said .
The British conglomerate planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a 13.35 billion 21.03 billion takeover bid by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value-boosting measures .
If anything the gyrations in world stock markets and in B.A.T 's share price since last Friday 's sharp Wall Street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring analysts and several big institutional holders said .
Thank God we have some deal on the table said Stewart Gilchrist a director at Scottish Amicable Investment Managers which intends to vote its roughly 1 % stake in favor of the restructuring .
Investors in B.A.T have been on a roller coaster .
B.A.T has been London 's best-performing blue chip over the past six months up 40 % against a 4 % rise in the Financial Times 100-Share Index .
But this week B.A.T has been hit harder than other big U.K. stocks first by the market gyrations then by Tuesday 's San Francisco earthquake which could leave B.A.T 's Farmers Group Inc. insurance unit facing big claims .
B.A.T rose five pence eight cents to 756 pence 11.91 in London yesterday as a late market rally erased a 28-pence fall earlier in the day .
To fight off predators B.A.T plans to spin off about 6 billion in assets largely by selling such U.S. retailing units as Marshall Field and Saks and by floating its big paper and U.K. retailing business via share issues to existing holders .
Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10 % of its shares and a 50 % dividend increase .
I think the restructuring will get the required support said Michael Pacitti an analyst at London stockbroker UBS Phillips & Drew .
The shareholders effectively will support the share price by clearing the share buy-back .
But B.A.T 's restructuring which was never going to happen quickly now will take longer because of the market upheaval .
Company officials holders and analysts who previously expected the disposals to be substantially complete by the end of next year 's first half now say the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second half .
We are n't forced sellers .
We do n't have an absolute deadline and if market conditions are truly awful we might decide it is not the right time to take particular steps said Michael Prideaux a B.A.T spokesman .
Even if B.A.T receives approval for the restructuring the company will remain in play say shareholders and analysts though the situation may unfold over the next 12 months rather than six .
The new B.A.T will be a smaller tobacco and financial-services hybrid whose price-earnings ratio may more closely reflect the lower-growth tobacco business than the higher-multiple financial-services business these holders believe .
Thus B.A.T 's restructuring may only make the company a more manageable target for other corporate predators possibly such acquisitive bidders as Hanson PLC .
The last few days will surely slow down the pace of events says Scottish Amicable 's Mr. Gilchrist .
But I would n't write off Sir James or other potential bidders .
Among possible delays the sales of Saks and Marshall Field which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial Christmas season may slide into the second quarter or second half .
Analysts estimate that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly 2 billion .
B.A.T is n't predicting a postponement because the units are quality businesses and we are encouraged by the breadth of inquiries said Mr. Prideaux .
But the delay could happen if B.A.T does n't get adequate bids he said .
People familiar with B.A.T say possible acquirers for the units include managers from both retailing chains and General Cinema Corp. which is interested in bidding for Saks .
Other potential bidders for parts of B.A.T 's U.S. retail unit include Dillard Department Stores Inc. May Department Stores Co. and Limited Inc .
B.A.T has declined to identify the potential bidders .
Though Sir James has said he intends to mount a new bid for B.A.T once approval from U.S. insurance regulators is received jitters over prospects for junk-bond financing and U.S. leverage buy-outs are making investors more skeptical about Sir James 's prospects .
His initial offer indicated he needed to raise as much as 80 % of the takeover financing through the debt markets .
Market uncertainty also clouds the outlook for B.A.T 's attracting a premium price for its U.S. retailing properties .
Finally Tuesday 's California earthquake initially knocked 3.7 % off B.A.T 's share price in London yesterday because of fears of the potential claims to Los Angeles-based Farmers which has a substantial portion of its property and casualty exposure in California .
On Farmers Mr. Prideaux said it is too early to quantify the level of potential claims .
He added B.A.T has no expectation of a material impact on Farmers .
Bridge and highway collapses will disrupt truck and auto transportation in the San Francisco Bay area for months to come .
But rail air and ocean-shipping links to the area escaped Tuesday 's earthquake with only minor damage and many are expected to be operating normally today government and corporate transport officials said .
Air traffic at San Francisco International Airport was running about 50 % of normal yesterday afternoon but airport officals said they expect a return to full operations by Saturday .
The major gateway to Asia and one of the nation 's 10 busiest airports was closed to all but emergency traffic from the time the quake hit Tuesday afternoon until 6 a.m. PDT yesterday when controllers returned to the tower .
Getting to and from the airport in coming weeks may be the problem however .
People 's ability to drive throughout the bay area is greatly restricted said a spokesman for the American Automobile Association .
Tom Schumacher executive vice president and general manager of the California Trucking Association in Sacremento said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the Bay area yesterday except for emergency-medical supplies .
Some foodstuff shipments will probably resume Thursday he said .
Right now most of the roads into the Bay area are closed but the list of closings changes about every 20 minutes .
This Wednesday morning the San Mateo bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed Mr. Schumacher said .
United Parcel Service Greenwich Conn. said its operations in the San Francisco area have been reduced to 40 % of normal .
A UPS spokesman said that although none of the company 's terminals trucks or airplanes were damaged in the quake road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages .
The spokesman noted four-hour to five-hour traffic delays on the San Mateo bridge for example .
In addition power failures prevented its package-sorting facilities from operating causing delays .
But freight railroads reported that damage to their facilities was relatively minor with Santa Fe Pacific Corp. 's rail unit the least affected by the quake .
Santa Fe stopped freight trains Tuesday night while its officials inspected track but resumed service at 10:45 p.m. when they found no damage .
Union Pacific Corp. 's rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its Oakland yard its track bridges and structures were unharmed .
That railroad is operating trains but with delays caused by employees unable to get to work .
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. the hardest hit of the three railroads in the Bay area said service on its north-south coastline which is used by an Amtrak train between Los Angeles and Seattle was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake .
But service on the line is expected to resume by noon today .
We had no serious damage on the railroad said a Southern Pacific spokesman .
We have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down .
Amtrak said it suspended train service into its Oakland station which sustained heavy structural damage during the quake .
The passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in Sacramento relying on buses to ferry passengers to the Bay area .
Amtrak said it planned to resume some train operations to Oakland late yesterday .
Rail-transit operations suffered little damage according to Albert Engelken deputy executive director of the American Public Transit Association in Washington .
The Bay Area Rapid Transit withstood the earthquake perfectly said Mr. Engelken adding that the rail system was running a full fleet of 45 trains during the day to provide an alternative for highway travelers .
The highway system is screwed up by the earthquake Mr. Engelken said .
The transit system is how people are going to be getting around .
He added that San Francisco 's trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels .
Although air-traffic delays in San Francisco were significant yesterday they did n't appear to spread to other airports .
The earthquake shattered windows at San Francisco International 's air-traffic control tower and rained pieces of the ceiling down on controllers three of whom suffered minor injuries .
Terminals at San Francisco International also were damaged but the tower itself was intact .
Tuesday night thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel .
Runways at San Francisco were n't damaged but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour down from 33 to 45 an hour normally mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows an FAA spokeswoman said .
While the airport was closed flights were diverted to airports in Sacramento and Stockton Calif. Reno and Las Vegas Nev. and Los Angeles .
United Airlines the largest carrier at San Francisco was operating only 50 % of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area .
A United spokesman said 14 of its 21 gates were unusable mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors .
The United spokesman said none of its people were injured at the airport in fact as the airport was being evacuated Tuesday night two babies were born .
Yesterday the United ticket counter was active with people trying to get flights out but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active with people trying to get there to help family and friends .
The airports in San Jose and Oakland were both fully operational by noon yesterday the Federal Aviation Administration said .
In terms of diversions Denver 's Stapleton International may have experienced the most far-flung A United flight from Japan was rerouted there .
I think that 's the first nonstop commercial passenger flight from Japan to land here an airport spokesman said .
A Japan Air Lines spokesman said its flights into and out of San Francisco were n't affected but getting information about its operations was difficult .
Its telecommunications headquarters in Burlingame Calif. had been knocked out since the quake .
We 're in the dark he said .
Whitbread & Co. put its spirits division up for sale triggering a scramble among global groups for the British company 's brands .
Whitbread already has been approached by about half a dozen companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business a spokesman said .
Analysts expect the spirits operations and some California vineyards that also are being sold to fetch about 500 million 788.8 million .
Among the brands for sale are Beefeater gin the No. 2 imported gin in the U.S. and Laphroaig single-malt whiskey .
Also for sale are Buckingham Wile Co. which distributes Cutty Sark blended whiskey in the U.S. and Whitbread 's Atlas Peak Vineyards in California 's Napa Valley .
Beefeater alone is worth as much as 300 million analysts said .
Whitbread bought the Beefeater distillery two years ago for 174.5 million .
That purchase represented an attempt by Whitbread a venerable British brewer to become a major player in the global liquor business .
But Whitbread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry .
Now it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations .
For rival liquor companies the Whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands .
It 's not very often something like this comes up said Ron Littleboy a liquor company analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London .
The division will be sold off quite rapidly predicted Neill Junor an analyst at London brokers County NatWest WoodMac .
Among possible buyers Grand Metropolitan PLC might find Beefeater a useful addition to its portfolio .
Grand Met owns Bombay gin the No. 3 imported gin in the U.S. rival Guinness PLC has the No. 1 imported brand Tanqueray .
The Whitbread spirits auction is an extremely interesting development and naturally we 'll be considering it carefully a Grand Met spokesman said .
Guinness which owns several leading whiskey brands plus Gordon 's gin the world 's No. 1 gin is considered less likely to bid for the Whitbread spirits .
A Guinness spokesman declined to comment .
Two other global liquor giants Canada 's Seagram Co. and Britain 's Allied-Lyons PLC also are possible buyers .
Seagram 's gin is the world 's No. 2 gin brand but the company does n't own any of the major gin brands imported in the U.S. .
Allied-Lyons while powerful in whiskey does n't own any major white-spirit brands .
We will certainly have to take a look at the Whitbread spirits business an Allied-Lyons spokesman said .
We would certainly like to have a major white-spirits brand in our portfolio .
A Seagram spokesman in New York would n't comment .
Smaller liquor companies such as Brown-Forman Corp. and American Brands Inc. of the U.S. also are likely to be interested .
Such companies are increasingly being left behind in the global liquor business says Nomura 's Mr. Littleboy .
In New York a spokesman for American Brands would n't comment .
Brown-Forman a Louisville Ky. distiller also declined to comment .
Whitbread 's wine spirits and soft-drink operations had trading profit of 35.4 million on sales of 315.5 million in the year ended Feb. 25 .
The company which is retaining most of its wine and all of its soft-drink interests did n't break out results for the businesses it plans to sell .
But analysts estimate their trading profit at 30 million .
Whitbread had total pretax profit in the year ended Feb. 25 of 223.2 million on sales of 2.26 billion .
Whitbread 's spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the British beer industry .
Earlier this year the government announced plans to foster increased competition in the industry .
British brewers currently own thousands of pubs which in turn sell only the breweries ' beer and soft drinks .
Under new rules many of the country 's pubs would become free houses selling beers of their choice .
Whitbread now intends to bolster its brewing interests in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses .
The company which last month paid 50.7 million for regional British brewer Boddington Group PLC has about 13 % of the British beer market .
Whitbread also owns the license to brew and distribute Heineken and Stella Artois beers in Britain .
In addition Whitbread intends to focus on its newer hotel liquor store and restaurant businesses in Europe and North America .
In Britain those interests include the Beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with PepsiCo Inc. of the country 's Pizza Hut chain .
In Canada and the U.S. Whitbread owns The Keg chain of steak and seafood restaurants .
Focusing on beer restaurants and hotels means we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively Peter Jarvis Whitbread 's managing director said in a statement .
The spirits business would require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players .
Whitbread also announced that Mr. Jarvis who is 48 will become the company 's chief executive March 1 .
At that time Sam Whitbread the company 's chairman and a descendant of its 18th-century founder will retire from executive duties .
He will retain the honorary title of non-executive chairman .
The Treasury plans to raise 700 million in new cash with the sale Tuesday of about 10 billion in two-year notes to redeem 9.29 billion in maturing notes .
The offering will be dated Oct. 31 and mature Oct. 31 Tenders for the notes available in minimum 5,000 denominations must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Tuesday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
NEWHALL LAND & FARMING Co. Valencia Calif. announced a 2-for-1 split in the real estate limited partnership 's units and increased its regular quarterly cash distribution 33 % to 40 cents a unit .
The real estate limited partnership also said it will pay a special year-end cash distribution of 10 cents a unit .
Both distributions are payable Dec. 4 to limited partners of record Nov. 3 .
Mellon Bank Corp. said directors authorized the buy-back of as many as 250,000 common shares .
The bank holding company said stock repurchased will be used to meet requirements for the company 's benefit plans .
Mellon has 36.6 million shares outstanding .
Champion International Corp. 's third-quarter profit dropped 17 % reflecting price declines for certain paper products operating problems at certain mills and other factors .
The paper producer reported that net income fell to 102.1 million or 1.09 a share from 122.4 million or 1.29 a share in the year-earlier period .
Sales rose 2.6 % to 1.32 billion from 1.29 billion .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Champion 's shares rose 25 cents to 32.125 .
Digital Equipment Corp. is planning a big coming-out party on Tuesday for its first line of mainframe computers .
But an uninvited guest is expected to try to crash the party .
On the morning of the long-planned announcement International Business Machines Corp. is to introduce its own new mainframe .
Their attitude is You want to talk mainframes we 'll talk mainframes says one computer industry executive .
They 're deliberately trying to steal our thunder a Digital executive complains .
Maybe we should take it as a compliment .
Digital 's target is the 40 billion market for mainframe computers the closet-sized number-crunchers that nearly every big company needs to run its business .
IBM based in Armonk N.Y. has dominated the market for decades .
That does n't scare Digital which has grown to be the world 's second-largest computer maker by poaching customers of IBM 's mid-range machines .
Digital based in Maynard Mass. hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes and it has spent almost 1 billion developing the new technology .
A spoiler nimble Tandem Computers Inc. in Cupertino Calif. jumped into the fray earlier this week with an aggressively priced entry .
IBM appears more worried about Digital which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line dubbed the VAX 9000 .
It 's going to be nuclear war says Thomas Willmott a consultant with Aberdeen Group Inc .
The surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market where growth has slowed to single digits in recent years .
IBM 's traditional mainframe rivals including Unisys Corp. Control Data Corp. and NCR Corp. have struggled recently .
Digital is promising a new approach .
Robert M. Glorioso Digital 's vice president for high performance systems says Digital 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations personal computers printers and other devices .
And unlike IBM 's water-cooled mainframes it does n't need any plumbing .
The challengers will have a big price advantage .
Digital is expected to tag its new line from about 1.24 million to 4.4 million and up depending on configuration .
That 's about half the price of comparably equipped IBM mainframes .
Tandem 's pricing is just as aggressive .
The heightened competition will hit IBM at a difficult time .
The computer giant 's current mainframe line which has sold well and has huge profit margins is starting to show its age .
The new 3090s due next week will boost performance by only about 8 % to 10 % .
And IBM is n't expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until 1991 .
Still no one expects IBM 's rivals to deliver a knockout .
IBM has a near-monopoly on mainframes with an estimated 70 % share of the market .
IBM is five times the size of Digital and 40 times the size of Tandem and wields enormous market power .
It counts among its customers a majority of the world 's largest corporations which entrust their most critical business information to IBM computers .
We 're not going to walk in and replace a company 's corporate accounting system if it 's already running on an IBM mainframe concedes Kenneth H. Olsen Digital 's president .
He says Digital will target faster-growing market segments such as on-line transaction processing which includes retail-sales tracking airline reservations and bank-teller networks .
Tandem which already specializes in on-line transaction processing is a potent competitor in that market .
A key marketing target for Digital will be the large number of big customers who already own both Digital and IBM systems .
One such company is Bankers Trust Co .
Stanley Rose a vice president technological and strategic planning at Bankers Trust says that despite Digital 's low prices we are n't about to unplug our IBM mainframes for a DEC machine .
The software conversion costs would dwarf any savings .
But Mr. Rose is still looking seriously at the 9000 .
Bankers Trust uses Digital 's VAX to run its huge money-transfer and capital markets accounts juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day he says .
As that system grows larger computers may be needed .
In the past customers had to go to IBM when they outgrew the VAX .
Now they do n't have to he says .
That 's going to cost IBM revenue .
Analysts say Digital can expect this pent-up demand for the new VAX to fuel strong sales next year .
Barry F. Willman an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. estimates the 9000 could boost sales by more than 1 billion in the fiscal year beginning in July .
He bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds of Digital 's largest customers .
Although Digital will announce a full family of mainframes next week it is n't expected to begin shipping in volume until next year .
The first model available will be the 210 which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the optional super-charger or vector processor says Terry Shannon of International Data Corp. a market research concern .
Four more models aimed squarely at IBM 's commercial customers are expected to begin shipping in late June .
Most analysts do n't expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal first quarter which begins next July 1 .
Digital 's new line has been a long time coming .
The company has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe-class product and made a costly decision in 1988 to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end .
Digital 's failure to deliver a true mainframe-class machine before now may have cost the company as much as 1 billion in revenue in fiscal 1989 Mr. Willman says .
IBM will face still more competition in coming months .
Amdahl Corp. backed by Japan 's Fujitsu Ltd. has a growing share of the market with its low-priced IBM-compatible machines .
And National Advanced Systems a joint venture of Japan 's Hitachi Ltd. and General Motors Corp. 's Electronic Data Systems is expected to unveil a line of powerful IBM-compatible mainframes later this year .

The frenetic stock and bond markets cooled off but the dollar slumped .
Stocks rose slightly as trading activity slowed from the frenzied pace earlier this week .
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds hovered in a narrow band most of the day finishing little changed despite the dollar 's weakness and fears about a wave of government borrowing coming soon .
Helped by futures-related program buying the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4.92 points to close at 2643.65 .
But the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell for the seventh-consecutive session as more investors dumped UAL shares .
Bond prices rallied early yesterday morning as traders scrambled to buy Treasury issues on fears that the Northern California earthquake might lead to a stock-market debacle .
But when stocks held steady Treasury bonds later retreated .
Speculation that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in coming weeks helped push the dollar down while boosting stocks traders said .
But many investors remain wary about stocks partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk-bond market that would make it more difficult to finance corporate takeovers .
I 'm surprised we did n't see more volatility in stocks said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker .
I think the problems in the junk-bond area are just beginning and this will be very unsettling for companies that have issued junk bonds .
In a bull market credit does not matter Mr. DeVoe added .
But when it does matter then it 's the only thing that matters .
However many institutional investors are reacting to the stock market 's plunge as a great buying opportunity said Charles I. Clough chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
Things are beginning to settle down .
The markets are returning to normalcy .
Oil prices initially rose on fears that the massive earthquake in Northern California would disrupt production .
But prices later reversed course finishing slightly lower as investors concluded that any cuts would n't be large and that foreign oil producers would quickly pick up the slack .
In major market activity Stock prices rose .
New York Stock Exchange volume shrank to 166.9 million shares from 224.1 million Tuesday .
Advancers on the Big Board outpaced decliners by 822 to 668 .
Bond prices were little changed in sluggish activity .
The yield on the Treasury 's 30-year issue fell slightly to 8.03 % .
The dollar dropped .
In New York late yesterday the currency was at 141.45 yen and 1.8485 marks down from 142.75 yen and 1.8667 marks late Tuesday .
James L. Madson 46 years old was named a vice president and assistant general manager of this producer of copper and other minerals .
He will succeed Arthur E. Himebaugh as general manager Feb. 1 when Mr. Himebaugh retires .
AMR Corp. posted an 8.8 % drop in third-quarter net income and said the fourth quarter will be disappointing as well primarily because of slimmer profit margins and increased fuel costs .
AMR 's earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of American Airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records .
Some analysts say the latest results only seem pale by comparison with a spectacular second half of 1988 .
Still AMR 's stumble does n't bode well for the rest of the industry .
The Fort Worth Texas company is generally regarded as one of the best-run in the business and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days .
Meanwhile the company 's board which had said nothing publicly about investor Donald Trump 's recently withdrawn 7.5 billion offer for AMR issued a statement condemning ill-conceived and reckless bids and saying it was pleased that Mr. Trump had backed out .
In the third quarter AMR said net fell to 137 million or 2.16 a share from 150.3 million or 2.50 a share .
Revenue rose 17 % to 2.73 billion from 2.33 billion a year earlier .
AMR 's chairman Robert L. Crandall said the results were due to an 11 % year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield an industry measure analogous to profit margin on each seat sold .
We think these trends will continue and will produce a very disappointing fourth quarter as well he said .
Tim Pettee an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. said The business turned faster than expected .
Costs are giving them a little bit of trouble and the whole industry is having a pricing problem .
For the nine months AMR 's net rose 15 % to 415.9 million or 6.59 a share from 360.1 million or 5.99 a share .
Revenue jumped 22 % to 7.89 billion from 6.46 billion .
AMR 's board in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday said Ill-considered and reckless acquisition proposals adversely affect employee financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of AMR shareholders .
AMR has not been and is not for sale .
Mr. Crandall said the company 's current decline in earnings is exactly the kind of situation that an excessively leveraged company laden with debt from a takeover would find difficult to weather .
Our very disappointing third-quarter results and the discouraging outlook for the fourth quarter underscore the importance of an adequate capital base he said .

Mr. Whittington will remain on the main group board as a nonexecutive director .
Without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses the economic and structural damage by Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina would have been much less as highlighted by your Oct. 3 editorial Subsidizing Disaster .
Congress should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands such as the hard-hit Isle of Palms near Charleston .
As you mentioned subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the Coastal Barrier Resource System .
The National Taxpayers Union would like Congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989 .
This bill simply says that if you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do so without taxpayer support .
Private-property rights would be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development .
However home builders would have to bear the full costs of such beach-house construction .
A Taxpayers Union study concluded the bill would save taxpayers up to 9.3 billion in barrier-island subsidies over 20 years .
Already the 1982 legislation has saved an estimated 800 million .
Marshall Y. Taylor Communications Director National Taxpayers Union The government said 13.1 % of Americans or 31.9 million people were living in poverty in 1988 .
While last year 's figure was down from 13.4 % in 1987 and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate the Census Bureau said the 1988 drop was n't statistically significant .
The bureau 's report also showed that while some measures of the nation 's economic well-being improved modestly in 1988 the fruits of prosperity were shared less equitably than the year before .
Summarizing data derived from a March 1989 survey of 58,000 households William Butz associate director of the Census Bureau said that most groups either stayed the same or improved .
But he added Since the late 1960s the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal .
There was no reversal of that trend between 1987 and 1988 .
Per capita income a widely used measure of a nation 's economic health hit a record in 1988 rising 1.7 % after inflation adjustment to 13,120 .
But the median income of American families fell 0.2 % the first time it has failed to rise since 1982 .
Mr. Butz said the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure including the rising number of female-headed families and a sharp increase in income reported by Americans who are n't living in families .
As a result of last year 's decline the government 's estimate for the number of people living below the poverty line declined by about 500,000 .
The poverty threshold defined as three times food expenses as calculated by the Agricultural Department last year was 12,092 for a family of four .
The Census Bureau counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line but it does n't consider other government benefits such as Medicare .
Thanks largely to the continued growth of the U.S. economy the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the 1983 peak of 15.3 % but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years .
Poverty remains far more widespread among blacks than other Americans .
In 1988 31.6 % of blacks lived in poverty compared with 10.1 % for whites and 26.8 % for Hispanics .
But two-thirds of all poor Americans were white .
More than half of poor families were headed by women living without men the bureau said .
More than three-fourths of poor black families were headed by women .
The poverty rate of children under 18 years old dropped last year to 19.7 % from 20.5 % in 1987 but remained far higher than a decade ago .
The rate among the elderly 12 % in 1988 was n't significantly lower than the year before .
If it were n't for Social Security payments more than three times as many elderly would be below the poverty line Mr. Butz said .
The Census Bureau also said Some 17.2 % of all money income received by families in 1988 went to the wealthiest 5 % of all families up from 16.9 % in 1987 .
That is the greatest share reported for any year since 1950 although changing definitions over the years distort the comparison .
The top fifth of all families got 44 % of the income up from 41.5 % a decade earlier .
The bottom fifth of all families got 4.6 % of the income down from 5.2 % a decade earlier .
Confirming other government data showing that wages are n't keeping pace with inflation earnings of year-round full-time male workers fell 1.3 % in 1988 after adjusting for higher prices the first such drop since 1982 .
Earnings of female workers were unchanged .
Women working full-time earned 66 cents for every dollar earned by men a penny more than in 1987 and seven cents more than in 1978 .
Median household income which includes both those living in families and those who are n't rose 0.3 % last year to 27,225 after inflation .
It rose sharply in the Northeast and Midwest and fell slightly in the South and West .
Median family income was 32,191 down 0.2 % .
Per capita income of blacks though still only 60 % that of whites rose 3.9 % in 1988 while per capita income of whites rose only 1.5 % .
Among married couples the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply as income of black families shot up 6.8 % while income of whites did n't budge .
Fueling a controversy that has been simmering for years the Census Bureau also said its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer-price measure adopted in 1983 .
The bureau said some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988 and the poverty rate would have been 10.5 % instead of 13.1 % under the alternative calculation .
Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years .
A report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress released yesterday concluded It is misleading to make this change without adjusting for other changes .
The official poverty threshold is set by the Office of Management and Budget .
John E. Hayes Jr. was elected chairman president and chief executive officer succeeding David S. Black who retired .
Mr. Hayes 52 years old left Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. in January where he had been chairman president and chief executive to join Triad Capital Partners a St. Louis company with interests in solid waste and recycling telecommunications and international venture capital .
He has resigned his posts at Triad to take the Kansas Power positions .
Kansas Power said Mr. Black 61 chose early retirement .
The space shuttle Atlantis boosted the Galileo spacecraft on its way to Jupiter giving a big lift as well to an ambitious U.S. program of space exploration .
Seven years late in the launching 1 billion over budget and a target of anti-nuclear protestors Galileo has long been a symbol of trouble for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration .
But yesterday as Atlantis rumbled into a patch of clear sky above Florida with storm clouds closing in on it NASA sought to turn Galileo into a symbol of triumph .
NASA did it right that 's the message said J.R. Thompson the agency 's deputy administrator .
The 1.4 billion robot spacecraft faces a six-year journey to explore Jupiter and its 16 known moons .
If all goes well it will parachute a probe into the dense Jovian atmosphere in July 1995 to pick up detailed data about gases that may be similar to the material from which the solar system was formed 4.6 billion years ago .
Jupiter is so enormous its mass is 318 times that of Earth that its gravity may have trapped these primordial gases and never let them escape .
Investigating Jupiter in detail may provide clues to what astronomer Tobias Owen calls the cosmic paradox of life Jupiter and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on Earth but these planets are lifeless Earth on the other hand has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life .
Some scientists have suggested that comets and asteroids may have brought enough of this kind of material from the outer solar system to Earth to spawn life .
Beginning in December 1995 Galileo will begin a two-year tour of the Jovian moons .
In 1979 two Voyager spacecraft sent back stunning photos of Jovian moons Io and Europa that showed them to be among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system .
The photos showed active geysers on Io spewing sulfurous material 190 miles into its atmosphere and indicated that Europa may have an ocean hidden under a thick sheet of ice .
Galileo 's photos of Europa will be more than 1,000 times as sharp as Voyager 's according to Torrence Johnson Galileo 's project scientist and may show whether it actually has the only known ocean other than those on Earth .
Atlantis lifted Galileo from the launch pad at 12:54 p.m. EDT and released the craft from its cargo bay about six hours later .
Galileo is on its way to another world in the hands of the best flight controllers in this world Atlantis Commander Donald Williams said .
Fly safely .
The five-member Atlantis crew will conduct several experiments including growing plants and processing polymeric materials in space before their scheduled landing at Edwards Air Force Base Calif. Monday .
The Galileo project started in 1977 and a number of project veterans were on hand to watch the launch .
An ebullient Mr. Johnson wearing a NASA baseball cap and carrying a camera and binoculars called the launch fantastic .
Benny Chin manager of the Galileo probe compared it to watching a child leave home .
I 'm happy and sad he said .
Anti-nuclear activists took a less positive view .
Having argued that Galileo 's plutonium power source could have released lethal doses of radiation if the shuttle exploded yesterday they were n't quieted by yesterday 's successful launch .
Galileo will skim past Earth in 1990 and 1992 collecting energy from the planet 's gravitational field to gain momentum for its trip to Jupiter .
The protesters point out that Galileo also could crash to Earth then .
They said they dropped plans to infiltrate the Kennedy Space Center after NASA beefed up its security .
One protest did get past NASA 's guard though a computer virus caused anti-Galileo messages to flash onto some computer screens at NASA centers .
The successful launch continues a remarkable recovery in the U.S. space-science program .
An unmanned spacecraft Magellan already is heading to Venus and is due to begin mapping the planet next August .
Voyager 2 sent back spectacular photos of Neptune and its moon Triton this summer .
Next month NASA plans to launch a satellite to study cosmic rays dating from the birth of the universe .
In December the shuttle Columbia will try to retrieve a satellite that 's been in orbit for nearly five years measuring the deleterious effects of space on materials and instruments .
Next March the shuttle Discovery will launch the Hubble space telescope a 1.5 billion instrument designed to see the faintest galaxies in the universe .
Not all of NASA 's space-science work will be so auspicious though .
Around Thanksgiving the Solar Max satellite which NASA repaired in orbit in 1984 will tumble back into the Earth 's atmosphere .
NASA wo n't attempt a rescue instead it will try to predict whether any of the rubble will smash to the ground and where .
The Associated Press 's earthquake coverage drew attention to a phenomenon that deserves some thought by public officials and other policy makers .
Private relief agencies such as the Salvation Army and Red Cross mobilized almost instantly to help people while the Washington bureaucracy took hours getting into gear .
One news show we saw yesterday even displayed 25 federal officials meeting around a table .
We recall that the mayor of Charleston complained bitterly about the federal bureaucracy 's response to Hurricane Hugo .
The sense grows that modern public bureaucracies simply do n't perform their assigned functions well .
Bally Manufacturing Corp. and New York developer Donald Trump have agreed in principle to a 6.5 million settlement of shareholder litigation stemming from Bally 's alleged greenmail payment to Mr. Trump .
According to lawyers familiar with the settlement talks the verbal agreement to end a lawsuit filed more than two years ago was reached last week and will soon be submitted to a federal judge in Camden N.J .
In February 1987 Bally thwarted a possible hostile takeover bid from Mr. Trump by agreeing to buy 2.6 million of Mr. Trump 's 3.1 million Bally shares for 83.7 million more than 18 million above market price .
The term greenmail refers to a situation where a company pays a premium over market value to repurchase a stake held by a potential acquirer .
Lawyers for shareholders Bally and Mr. Trump all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement citing a request by a federal court magistrate not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed .
But some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said the 6.5 million payment will be shared by Bally and Mr. Trump with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money .
The amount Bally and Mr. Trump will pay to settle the class-action suit pales in comparison to the 45 million Walt Disney Co. and Saul Steinberg 's Reliance Group Holdings Inc. agreed to pay to settle a similar suit in July .
That settlement represented the first time shareholders were granted a major payment in a greenmail case .
Mr. Steinberg made a 59.7 million profit on the sale to Disney of his investment in the company in 1984 .
But lawyers said Mr. Steinberg probably faced much more potential liability because when he sued Disney during his takeover battle he filed on behalf of all shareholders .
When Disney offered to pay Mr. Steinberg a premium for his shares the New York investor did n't demand the company also pay a premium to other shareholders .
When Mr. Trump sued Bally he sued only on behalf of himself .
Mr. Trump and Bally also appeared to have some leverage in the case because in the state of Delaware where Bally is incorporated courts have held that greenmail is often protected by the business-judgment rule .
That rule gives boards of directors wide latitude in deciding how to deal with dissident shareholders .
