estment once the price reaches a certain level .
Once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get .
Stop orders are sometimes called stop-loss orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses .
While stop orders sound similar to limit orders there is a difference Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above .
In contrast sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below .
The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do .
An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at 90 under a stock that was trading at 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday .
Stop-Limit Order Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order .
Unlike stop orders which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price .
If it ca n't be made at that price it does n't get filled .
Investors who wish to be out of a position without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled .
But if the market moves quickly enough it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price .
Market-If-Touched Order Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached .
However unlike a buy-stop order a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it .
As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price .
Fill-Or-Kill Order The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades .
It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better .
But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately the order is automatically canceled .
Gregory Bessemer who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options .
I like to use them to feel out the market he says .
If they do n't fill it immediately then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price .
Not-Held Order This is another timing order .
It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment if they think they can get a better price by waiting .
Not-held orders which are also known as disregard the tape orders are always done at the customer 's risk .
One-Cancels-The-Other Order This is really two orders in one generally for the same security or commodity instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order .
In a fast-moving market it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security .
Specific-Time Order This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time .
On the close can be added to many types of orders .
For example market-on-close orders must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange .
Stop-close-only orders are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading .
Day orders expire at the end of the day on which they are entered good-till-canceled orders have no expiration date .
Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise .
On Oct. 19 1987 some investors learned the consequences of entering good-til-canceled limit orders and then forgetting about them .
They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel .
It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed .
Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are usually stuck with the consequences .
Mr. Angrist writes on the options and commodities markets for The Wall Street Journal .
IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments there 's probably no starting place better than beta .
But investors better not ignore its limitations either .
Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund .
For any given move in the overall market it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall .
Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret .
The beta of the broad market typically defined as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index is always 1.0 .
So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile and so on .
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas .
Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market .
Remember though that beta also has important limitations .
Beta is only part of the risk in a stock says William F. Sharpe the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure .
There is risk that is not associated with market moves and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that .
In particular beta does n't measure the company and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock .
That business risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio .
Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer .
In particular the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired .
Concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the American Association of Individual Investors to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual-fund guide .
Our fear was people would look just at the beta of a gold fund and say here is an investment with very low risk says John Markese director of research for the Chicago-based group .
In reality it 's very volatile but the movements are not because of market movements .
READY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio .
First a pop quiz .
When you think of the words risk and investment what 's the specific peril that comes to mind .
Pencils down .
If you 're like most people you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding .
People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension says Timothy Kochis national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte Haskins & Sells .
But therein lies another aspect of investment risk the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others .
This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs .
Risk wears many disguises and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other less obvious kinds .
U.S. Treasury bonds for example are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity .
But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments .
Risk is also a function of time .
When financial professionals measure risk mathematically they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns .
Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills for example because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider .
That is usually measured by the standard deviation or divergence of annual results from the average return over time .
But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals .
For instance some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash last Friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings .
But the stock market despite some stomach-churning declines has far outperformed other securities over extended periods .
By retreating to the apparent security of say money-market funds investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement .
That 's the biggest risk of all the risk of not meeting your objectives says Steven B. Enright a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services .
As a result financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients ' portfolios .
They estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year .
They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals .
And they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified .
The portfolios of two hypothetical families one a couple at retirement age and another a two-income couple at age 45 illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider .
For instance the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk .
But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk .
The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stoc
