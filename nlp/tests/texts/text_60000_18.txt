said Guy Hempel general manager of NBC affiliate WAVE in Louisville Ky .
A spokesman for National Broadcasting Co. a unit of General Electric Co. said the network was looking into what happened .
The stations said they were pleased with the extended coverage yesterday including a special five-hour edition of Today .
Don Browne director of news at NBC News said in an interview that we could n't get a signal out of San Francisco .
We were out of the box .
It was horrible .
The comment we 're hearing is that we were slow out of the box but beat everyone else in the stretch .
NBC broadcast throughout the entire night and did not go off the air until noon yesterday .
The quake postponed the third and fourth games of the World Series .
In place of the games ABC said it planned to broadcast next week 's episodes of its prime-time Wednesday and Thursday lineups except for a one-hour special on the earthquake at 10 p.m. last night .
The series is scheduled to resume Tuesday evening in San Francisco .
There are no commercials to make up for since we 're going to eventually broadcast the World Series said a network spokesman .
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. said it suspended indefinitely its common stock dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter net income .
The announcement made after the close of trading caught analysts by surprise .
The company closed at 12 a share down 62.5 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Pinnacle West slashed its quarterly dividend to 40 cents per share from 70 cents in December saying at the time that it believed the new lower dividend was sustainable .
A company spokesman said the decision to eliminate the dividend resulted from a quarterly appraisal and that circumstances had changed since the December announcement .
He declined to elaborate .
Edward J. Tirello Jr. an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. speculated that the sudden dividend elimination presages an expensive agreement with thrift regulators over the company 's insolvent MeraBank savings and loan unit .
Analysts have estimated that Pinnacle West may have to inject between 300 million and 400 million into the MeraBank unit before turning the thrift over to federal regulators .
The latest financial results at the troubled utility and thrift holding company based in Phoenix Ariz. reflect continuing problems at MeraBank and losses in real-estate venture-capital and uranium-mining operations .
Third-quarter net income slid to 5.1 million or six cents a share from 56 million or 65 cents a year earlier .
Utility operations the only company unit operating in the black in the latest period had a 26 % drop in profit to 86.3 million largely as a result of outages at the company 's huge Palo Verde nuclear facility and the cost of purchased replacement power .
In other operations losses at MeraBank totaled 85.7 million in the latest quarter compared with a 2.5 million profit a year earlier .
The latest quarter includes a 42.7 million addition to loan-loss reserves .
As recently as August the company said it did n't foresee a need for substantial additions to reserves .
Pinnacle 's SunCor Development Co .
real-estate unit 's loss narrowed to 13.8 million from 78.4 million .
The latest period included a 9 million write-down on undeveloped land while the year-earlier period included a 46 million reserve for real-estate losses .
Losses at its Malapai Resources Co .
uranium-mining unit narrowed to 3.4 million from 18 million a year ago which included a 9 million write-down of utility inventories .
Losses at El Dorado Investment Co. the venture-capital operation widened to 6.8 million from 425,000 a year earlier .
The latest quarter included a 6.6 million write-down of investments .
Equitec Financial Group said it will ask as many as 100,000 investors in 12 of its public real-estate limited partnerships to give approval to rolling them up into a new master limited partnership .
Under the proposal by Equitec a financially troubled real-estate syndicator New York-based Hallwood Group Inc. would replace Equitec as the newly formed master limited partnership 's general partner and manager .
Shares of the new partnership would trade on an exchange like a stock .
Hallwood is a merchant bank whose activities include the ownership management and financial restructuring of shopping centers office buildings apartments and other real estate .
In a statement Equitec Chairman Richard L. Saalfeld said the transfer will benefit both the company and investors in the 12 limited partnerships included in the proposed rollup .
While he did n't describe the partnerships ' financial condition he said their operations continue to drain the resources of Equitec .
Equitec posted a 3.3 million net loss in the second quarter on 11.8 million of revenue compared with a net loss of 12.9 million in the year-earlier period on revenue of 9.1 million .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Equitec closed at 2.625 a share unchanged .
Because of Tuesday 's earthquake in Northern California company officials could n't immediately be reached for additional comment .
A spokesman for Hallwood said the 12 limited partnerships which were marketed by brokerage firms and financial planners between 1979 and 1984 raised several hundred million dollars from investors .
With airline deals in a tailspin legendary Wall Street trader Michael Steinhardt could have trouble parachuting out of USAir Group traders say .
Only a week ago when airline buy-out fever was already winding down Mr. Steinhardt was engaged in a duel with USAir .
He was threatening to take over the carrier after spending an estimated 167 million to build an 8.4 % USAir stake for his investment clients .
The would-be raider even hired an investment banker to give teeth to his takeover threat which was widely interpreted as an effort to flush out an acquirer for USAir or for his own stake .
In fighting USAir Mr. Steinhardt was pitted against another investor billionnaire Warren Buffett who bought into USAir to help fend off Mr. Steinhardt .
Mr. Buffett 's firm Berkshire Hathaway holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than Mr. Steinhardt 's firm Steinhardt Partners .
Now in the wake of UAL 's troubles in financing its buy-out the airline raiding game has been grounded .
Instead of hoping to sell his USAir stake at analysts ' estimated buy-out price of 80 a share Mr. Steinhardt is stuck with roughly 3.7 million USAir shares that cost him 45 on average but yesterday closed at 40 1\/2 up 1\/4 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
It does n't make sense to parachute out at this price Mr. Steinhardt says though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends USAir managers ' operating skills .
At the current price the USAir holding represents 9 % of all the assets that Mr. Steinhardt manages .
A week ago USAir stock briefly soared above 52 after a report in USA Today that Mr. Steinhardt might launch a hostile bid for the carrier though takeover speculators say they were skeptical .
If USAir is worth 80 as a takeover and the stock went to 52 the market was saying Steinhardt 's presence was n't worth anything in terms of getting a deal done says a veteran takeover speculator .
Traders say this all goes to show that even the smartest money manager can get infected with crowd passions .
In trying to raid USAir Mr. Steinhardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor and ran into snags .
Moreover unlike Mr. Buffett who often holds big stakes in companies for years Mr. Steinhardt has n't in the past done much long-term investing .
Mr. Steinhardt who runs about 1.7 billion for Steinhardt Partners made his name as a gunslinging trader moving in and out of stocks with agility enriching himself and his investment clients .
Meanwhile his big losses for instance in 1987 's crash generally have been trading losses .
So some see a special irony in the fact that Mr. Steinhardt the trader now is encumbered with a massive illiquid airline holding .
Analysts say USAir stock might lose four or five points if the Steinhardt stake was dumped all at once .
As a result Mr. Steinhardt must reconcile himself to selling USAir at a loss or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment .
Long-term investing that 's not Steinhardt 's style chuckles an investor who once worked at Steinhardt Partners .
He does n't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an ace in the hole adds another Steinhardt Partners alumnus .
In recent days traders say USAir has been buying its own shares as part of a program to retire about eight million USAir shares though the carrier wo n't discuss its buy-back program .
If USAir stepped up its share purchases that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out says Timothy Pettee a Merrill Lynch analyst .
But USAir might not want to help Mr. Steinhardt he adds .
In 1987 USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny stonewalled when Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn threatened to take over the carrier .
Mr. Icahn a much more practiced raider than Mr. Steinhardt eventually sold a big USAir stake at a tiny profit through Bear Stearns .
Mr. Steinhardt also could take that route .
He confers big trading commissions on Wall Street firms .
However with airline stocks cratering he might not get a very good price for his shares traders say .
Especially galling for Mr. Steinhardt say people close to him is that USAir 's Mr. Colodny wo n't even take his telephone calls .
While USAir is n't considered absolutely takeover-proof its defenses including the sale in August of a 12 % stake in the company to Mr. Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway are pretty strong .
USAir 's deal with Mr. Buffett was n't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy Mr. Steinhardt says .
Since last April the investor has made seven so-called 13D filings in USAir as he bought and sold the company 's stock .
Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company 's managers and to stir interest in the stock .
But of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as Steinhardt Partners to take over a company .
USAir and Mr. Buffett wo n't talk about Mr. Steinhardt at all .
Analysts say USAir has great promise .
By the second half of 1990 USAir stock could hit 60 says Helane Becker of Shearson Lehman Hutton .
She thinks traders should buy the stock if it tumbles to 35 .
But meanwhile USAir is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest Piedmont Airlines which it acquired .
Moreover some investors think a recession or renewed airfare wars will pummel airline stocks in coming months .
However Mr. Steinhardt says he 's comfortable holding USAir as an investment .
While he has bought and sold some USAir shares in recent days he says that contrary to rumors he has n't tried to unload his holding .
Mr. Steinhardt adds that he bought USAir stock earlier this year as part of a fundamental investment in the airline group .
In 1989 Mr. Steinhardt says he made money trading in Texas Air AMR and UAL .
Overall his investments so far this year are showing gains of about 20 % he adds .
Does Mr. Steinhardt regret his incursion into the takeover-threat game .
People close to the investor say that was an experiment he is unlikely to repeat .
I do n't think you 'll find I 'm making a radical change in my traditional investment style Mr. Steinhardt says .
Addington Resources Inc. said it called for redemption on Nov. 21 its 25.8 million outstanding of 8 % convertible subordinated debentures due 2013 .
The debentures were issued in the face amount of 46 million on July 11 1988 the Ashland Ky. coal mining water transportation and construction company said .
The company said the redemption is permitted because the price of Addington 's stock has equaled or exceeded 19.60 for 20 consecutive trading days a condition set in the terms of the debentures .
Debenture holders are expected to convert most of the debentures into common because the value of the stock received in a conversion would exceed the 1,103.11 redemption price .
Commodore International Ltd. said it will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 because sales of personal computers for the home market remained weak in some major countries .
That will mark the second consecutive quarterly loss for Commodore and will raise additional questions about whether it can sustain the turnaround it had seemed to be engineering .
Commodore West Chester Pa. had said in August that it was consolidating manufacturing to cut costs and expected to be profitable in the fiscal first quarter .
Commodore said that its announcement is based on preliminary information and that the situation could look different by the time final results are announced early next month .
In fact Commodore 's fiscal fourth-quarter loss was 2 million narrower than Commodore had expected a few weeks after the quarter closed .
Still even results approaching break-even would mark a sharp weakening compared with fiscal 1989 first-quarter earnings of 9.6 million or 30 cents a share on sales of 200.2 million .
Reflecting concerns about Commodore 's outlook its stock has plunged more than 50 % since May closing yesterday unchanged at 8.875 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
The price can be expected to erode further because the loss estimate came after the market closed .
Commodore has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the U.S. where its personal-computer sales have been so dismal for years that Commodore is close to dropping off research firms ' market-share charts .
Commodore has assembled an experienced management team it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign .
But those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly even if they turn out to be the right ones .
In the meantime the strategies will increase expenses .
Commodore had been counting on its consumer business to stay sufficiently healthy to support its efforts in other areas mainly in getting schools and businesses to use its Amiga which has slick graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it is n't compatible with Apple Computer Inc. or International Business Machines Corp. hardware .
But sales to consumers have become difficult during the past several months even in West Germany which has been by far Commodore 's strongest market .
The Commodore 64 and 128 mainly used for children 's educational software and games had surprised market researchers by continuing to produce strong sales even though other low-profit personal computers now operate several times as fast and have much more memory .
Commodore has said it expects sales to rebound but market researchers have said that sales of the low-end products may finally be trailing off .
Stock prices closed slightly higher in the first routine trading day since Friday 's big plunge .
Some issues were affected by Tuesday 's devastating earthquake in the San Francisco area .
Activity continued to slow from the hectic pace set during the market 's plunge late Friday and its rebound Monday as players began to set their sights on events coming later this week .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted through the session within a trading range of about 30 points before closing with a gain of 4.92 at 2643.65 .
Broader averages also posted modest gains .
Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index rose 0.60 to 341.76 the Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 0.71 to 320.54 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.43 to 189.32 .
Some 822 New York Stock Exchange issues advanced in price while 668 declined .
But the Dow Jones Transportation Average went down for the seventh consecutive session due largely to further selling in UAL .
The average dropped 6.40 to 1247.87 and has now lost 21.7 % of its value since the losing streak began Oct. 10 .
Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks from 224.1 million Tuesday .
Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September due today and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown .
In addition activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area .
Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying .
The early move essentially established the day 's trading range and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently .
I did n't expect it to be this quiet .
I expected to see more volatility as some of the institutions who were spooked last Friday did some selling said Raymond F. DeVoe a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Baltimore .
Mr. DeVoe said he expects prices to show some renewed instability over the next few sessions as institutions re-evaluate their stance toward the market in light of its decline .
I would suspect that a lot of investment committees are looking into whether they want to be in stocks at all he said .
Insurance stocks were sold at the opening amid concerns about the level of damage claims the companies would receive as a result of the earthquake .
But those issues recovered quickly and turned higher because of expectations that the quake and the recent Hurricane Hugo would set the stage for an increase in premium rates .
Issues of insurance brokers were especially strong .

Granges said in Vancouver British Columbia that the production halt will be phased in over a 10-week period .
Tartan currently produces gold at a cash operating cost of 393 an ounce which is high by industry standards and 25 or so above the current spot price .

Computer Associates International Inc. Garden City N.Y. and Digital Equipment Corp. said they agreed to jointly develop software to help manage Digital 's Vax computers .
Computer Associates has carved out a huge business selling such software for use in managing networks of International Business Machines Corp. computers but needs to find new markets if it is to maintain its growth rate of 30 % and more each year .
The market for system-management software for Digital 's hardware is fragmented enough that a giant such as Computer Associates should do well there .
At the same time the market is smaller than the market for IBM-compatible software .
For one thing Digital Maynard Mass. has sold fewer machines .
In addition its machines are typically easier to operate so customers require less assistance from software .

Dayton Hudson Corp. said it accepted for purchase seven million common shares at 62.875 each under the terms of a Dutch auction self-tender offer .
The offer expired at 12:01 a.m. yesterday .
In a Dutch auction the buyer sets a price range and holders give a price in that range at which they 're willing to sell their shares .
The buyer then picks a price and buys shares at that price from holders who offered to sell at that price or lower .
Dayton Hudson 's repurchase offer representing about 9 % of its common shares outstanding had established a range of between 60 and 65 for the buy-back .
Dayton Hudson said it accepted all odd-lot shares tendered at or below the final 62.875 price the preliminary proration factor for other shares tendered at or below the final price is 98 % .
The Minneapolis-based retailer said it expects to pay for the seven million shares next Thursday .
Tendered shares not purchased will be returned to holders .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Dayton rose 1 to 61.125 .
Continental Bank Corp. 's third-quarter net income slipped 11 % despite a big gain from the sale of the company 's London headquarters building .
The 55 million gain on the sale was offset by lower interest income poorer results from foreign-exchange trading and a 9 million loss on the sale of a unit Securities Settlement Corp .
Chicago-based Continental earned 65.2 million or 1.04 a share compared with 73.6 million or 1.19 a share a year earlier .
The 1988 quarter also included one-time gains totaling about 35 million .
The bank which has loss reserves equal to about half its long-term and medium-term loans to less-developed nations said it does n't think additional reserves are required .
Enron Corp. said a subsidiary and two United Kingdom firms are studying the feasibility of constructing a 1,500 megawatt gas-fired power plant in northern England as an outgrowth of the government 's privatization program .
Enron Power Corp. a unit of the Houston natural gas pipeline company would design construct and run the plant .
Gas to fuel it would be piped from the North Sea .
A subsidiary of Britain 's Imperial Chemical Industries would buy electricity and steam from the proposed station .
Surplus power would be sold on the open market Enron said .
Also participating in the study Enron said is the National Power division of Britain 's Central Electricity Generating Board .
Upon privatization National Power will be responsible for 70 % of the country 's power generating business .
Viacom Inc. New York reported that its third-quarter loss widened to 21.7 million or 41 cents a share primarily because of interest expense of 70.1 million .
A year ago Viacom had a net loss of 56.9 million or 1.07 a share .
Interest expense in the 1988 third quarter was 75.3 million .
In the year-ago quarter Viacom also paid preferred stock dividends of 17 million Viacom exchanged its preferred stock for debt in March .
The communications and entertainment company said revenue rose to 345.5 million from 311.6 million .
Viacom attributed the improvement to higher earnings from operations in its networks segment which includes the MTV and Showtime networks .
Viacom said it also restructured bank debt under a 1.5 billion unsecured bank agreement that offers significant interest rate savings .
Sumner M. Redstone Viacom 's chairman said Viacom emerged from our leveraged buy-out structure and gained substantial operating and financial flexibility through the bank pact .
Trinova Corp. Maumee Ohio said it is launching an extensive restructuring of its core business and took a charge that resulted in a loss of 29.7 million or 87 cents a share for the third quarter .
Trinova said it will close move or overhaul 40 of its 170 manufacturing facilities and over the next three years cut 1,500 jobs from its current world-wide payroll of 22,300 employees .
Most of the factory closings and job cutbacks will affect Trinova 's Aeroquip operations which manufacture automotive plastics hoses and other industrial and automotive parts .
Hoses and plastics together account for about 42 % of Trinova 's total annual sales .
In a separate announcement Trinova said the Aeroquip group has agreed to sell its spring-brake piston-brake and related businesses to Midland Brake Inc. of Branford Conn .
Terms were n't disclosed .
To provide for the restructuring 's costs Trinova said it took an after-tax charge of 38.5 million or 1.13 a share in the third quarter .
The 29.7 million net loss compares with net income of 19.6 million or 57 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales rose 8 % to 456.2 million from 422 million .
Trinova closed at 25 down 1 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
A group of investors including Giancarlo Parretti 's Pathe Communications Corp. and Sasea Holding S.A. have agreed to buy 76.66 % of Odeon Finanziaria a financially troubled Italian TV station .
Florio Fiorini managing director of Geneva-based Sasea said the investors would pay only a symbolic one lira for the station but we have agreed to raise the capital that will enable the company to continue operating .
It 's sort of a Chapter 11 situation he added referring to the U.S. bankruptcy law that protects companies from creditors while they restructure .
Milan-based Odeon which draws about 3 % of Italian TV viewers has debt of 250 billion lire 181.9 million Mr. Fiorini said .
He added that details of the recapitalization still have to be worked out but that Pathe will take 50 % of Odeon Rome film producer Bruno Lucisano will take 10 % and the remaining 16.66 % currently owned by Sasea will eventually be sold to other investors .
Calisto Tanzi Odeon 's owner will retain his 23.34 % stake .
Italy 's Supreme Court this year ordered Parliament to write a law that will regulate media ownership .
We think that it 's going to be far more favorable to own a station before the law is passed than to try to buy one afterward Mr. Fiorini said .
San Francisco area officials gave the media high marks for helping people find shelter and obtain emergency information after Tuesday 's catastrophic earthquake .
The press has been doing an excellent job .
They are telling people what roads are closed and just keeping the public informed has helped to keep the panic down said James Ball a station supervisor at Daly City Police Department .
Mr. Ball noted that television stations featured people holding up phone books explaining where to call for help .
Radio stations provided an emergency number for people who smelled gas but did n't know how to turn off their gas supply .
Kim Schwartz a spokesperson for the American Red Cross in Los Angeles said television and radio stations in San Francisco played a very positive role by providing the address of 28 shelters of the Red Cross and by giving out the Red Cross number for contributions to help earthquake victims 1-800-453-9000 .
The San Francisco Examiner issued a special edition around noon yesterday that was filled entirely with earthquake news and information .
The Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle were able to publish despite Tuesday 's quake which occurred close to deadline for many newspapers .
Sterling Software Inc. said it lost its bid to supply software services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field Calif .
Sterling which estimated the value of the contract at 150 million said NASA selected another bidder for final negotiations .
In 1988 Dallas-based Sterling protested a similar decision by NASA involving the same contract claiming it had submitted the lowest bid .
As a result last March the General Services Administration board of contract appeals directed NASA to reopen negotiations on the contract .
Sterling said it had requested a briefing by NASA but had not decided whether to protest the agency 's latest decision .
Consolidated Rail Corp. New York reported that third-quarter net income climbed 4.8 % to 87 million or 1.27 a share exceeding analysts ' expectations .
In the year-earlier quarter the freight railroad earned 83 million or 1.21 a share .
James A. Hagen chairman and chief executive officer noted that earnings advanced in the face of a drop in business brought on by the general economic slowdown .
Revenue slipped 4.6 % to 835 million from 876 million .
