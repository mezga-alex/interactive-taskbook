ys Hendrik Verwoerd Jr. son of the former prime minister and the leader of the Orange Workers founded in 1980 .
They do indeed want their own nation .
The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of South Africa with Johannesburg opening its public facilities to all races blacks storming the all-white beaches of the Cape and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned African National Congress .
But here in Morgenzon a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal the Orange Workers are holding the pillars steady .
The Orange Workers who take their name from William of Orange of the Netherlands a hero of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners believe that the solution to South Africa 's racial problems is n't the abolition of apartheid it 's the perfection of apartheid complete and total separation of the races .
Here then is where the Orange Workers have come to make apartheid 's last stand .
Their idea is to create a city first and then an entire nation without blacks .
This may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in Africa .
And the fact that there are only 3,000 card-carrying Orange Workers may put them on the loony fringe .
But their ideal of an Afrikaner homeland an all-white reserve to be carved out of present-day South Africa is a mainstream desire of the right-wing which embraces about one-third of the country 's five million whites .
Afrikaner philosophers and theologians have long ruminated on the need for a white homeland .
The Orange Workers are just putting this preaching into practice .
Thus farmer Johan Fischer his T-shirt and jeans covered in grease crawls around under his planter tightening bolts and fixing dents .
On almost every other farm in South Africa black workers do the repairs .
But not here .
Mr. Fischer plows his own fields sows his own corn and sunflowers and feeds his own sheep .
Over at the fiberglass factory four white workers assemble water tanks on their own and in their spare time they build townhouses across the road .
On Main Street Alida Verwoerd and her daughters look after the clothes and fabric shop then hurry home to fix lunch for the rest of the family .
Down by the stream a group of Orange Workers puts the finishing touches on a golf course .
If whites want to play there by themselves says consulting engineer Willem van Heerden whites should also build it by themselves .
If we want to survive as a people he says we have to change our way of life .
The Afrikaner must end his reliance on others .
In their quest to perfect apartheid the Orange Workers have discovered a truth that most of privileged white South Africa tries mightily to deny The master ca n't become dependent on the slave and expect to remain master forever .
If apartheid means you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that go with it but you also want to exclude the blacks from social and political integration then these are two contradictions that ca n't go on forever says Mr. Verwoerd .
He is sitting in his living room beneath a huge portrait of his late father Hendrik F. Verwoerd apartheid 's architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966 .
Somewhere the son sighs things went terribly wrong with apartheid today whites even rely on blacks to police their separation .
People took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it .
But my father meant it to mean real separation says the son .
The Orange Workers speak sincerely .
We agree with world opinion that the status quo in South Africa is morally wrong says Pieter Bruwer the Orange Workers ' chief scribe and pamphleteer .
We must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly .
Morgenzon has long been a special domain of Afrikanerdom .
According to Mr. Verwoerd the early Afrikaner pioneers were the first people to settle in the eastern Transvaal even before the blacks .
Then when Morgenzon was incorporated in 1908 the farmer who owned the land stipulated that only whites could reside in town blacks could work there but they had to leave at night .
Today Morgenzon is a town of 800 whites and two paved roads .
Weeds push up through the cracks in the sidewalks and many houses and storefronts are empty .
There are few factories and no mines .
It was an ideal place for the Orange Workers to start their new nation unencumbered by the demographics that have undermined apartheid elsewhere in South Africa .
So far about 150 Orange Workers have moved here spending nearly 1 million buying up property over the past three years .
Still complete and total segregation remains elusive .
Just beyond the city limits is a shantytown of 2,000 blacks who are employed throughout the area .
Despite the Orange Workers ' intention to put them all out of work they are in no hurry to leave .
A young man called July that 's when he was born who works at the railroad station just up the street from the Orange Workers office points at the whitewalled building and says matter-of-factly We 're not allowed in there that 's all I know .
The 650-or-so local whites who are n't Orange Workers are more troubled .
Try as they might they just ca n't conceive of life without black workers .
Impossible impossible say the Conradies an elderly couple who have run the general store for decades .
We ca n't do without their help says Mrs. Conradie .
Oh no .
We need them and I thank God for them .
Over at the Shell station owner Rudi van Dyk who doubles as Morgenzon 's mayor worries that the Orange Workers have made his town the laughingstock of the nation .
What they want us to do just is n't practical he says noting that he employs 16 blacks .
I could n't afford to hire 16 whites .
The only Afrikaners who would be willing to work for this salary would n't know how to handle money .
Back at the Verwoerd house Hendrik Sr. peers down over the shoulder of Hendrik Jr .
The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no turning back the integration of South African society and politics Morgenzon will boom .
We urge our people not to wait until they have to fight for their own nation says Mr. Verwoerd .
By populating a place now we make ourselves a power any new government will have to take into account .
Curiously he compares the Orange Workers to the ANC which his father outlawed in 1960 .
The ANC wo n't be stopped until there is a provision for black aspirations says Mr. Verwoerd .
Likewise no government will stop this idea of the Afrikaners .
He apologizes for sounding pushy .
Look he says If the rest of South Africa wants to have an integrated melting pot that 's their choice .
We 'll leave them alone .
We just want to have our own cup of tea .
And they will even serve it themselves .
Okay now you can pick up that phone .
But do n't do anything rash .
After last Friday 's stock-market plunge investment professionals cautioned people to resist the urge to call their brokers and sell stocks .
Not selling into a panic turned out to be very good advice Despite the market 's volatility the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged 114 points in the past four days .
Now with a semblance of normalcy returning some advisers say it 's time for investors to take a hard cold look at the stocks they own and consider some careful pruning .
The market is sending nervous signals says Peter J. Canelo chief market strategist for Bear Stearns & Co. and it 's unwise to be overcommitted to stocks .
Alan Weston president of Weston Capital Management a Los Angeles money-management firm adds that in periods of uncertainty like today it 's a good time to cut out the dead branches of your portfolio .
Not everybody agrees that it 's time to trim .
We are n't inclined to prune stock portfolios now says Steven G. Einhorn chairman of the investment policy committee of Goldman Sachs & Co .
Investors should stay with their stocks .
We expect a choppy and sloppy market for a short period but we do n't think it will be ugly .
The downside is limited .
And even those who say some selective selling may be in order stress that individuals need to be in the stock market to achieve their long-term investment objectives and to help balance their other assets .
Any selling they say should be well thought-out and executed gradually during market rallies .
They offer these suggestions GET RID OF THE DOGS .
Sell stocks that are n't doing well now and that do n't have good earnings prospects says Alfred Goldman technical analyst at St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards & Sons .
Most people do just the opposite They sell their winners and keep their losers .
Which types of stocks are most likely to qualify .
Technology stocks says Mr. Goldman .
WATCH FOR EARNINGS DISAPPOINTMENTS .
A company does n't have to post a loss to be a candidate for sale says Charles I. Clough Jr. chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co .
If earnings do n't live up to analysts ' expectations he says that 's enough to dump the stock .
John Markese director of research for the American Association of Individual Investors raises a cautionary note .
Substituting a rule of thumb for your own judgment can be a mistake he says .
An earnings disappointment may reflect a situation that 's short-term .
But Mr. Clough says The risk is that earnings disappointments will continue .
The economy is decelerating after six good years and right now it 's better to shoot first and ask questions later .
Which types of stocks currently have the greatest earnings risks .
Computer companies commodity cyclical stocks like autos and retailing stocks he says .
BEWARE OF HEAVY DEBT .
The companies apt to run into earnings problems soonest are the ones with heavy debt loads says Larry Biehl partner in the San Mateo Calif. money-management firm of Bailard Biehl & Kaiser .
Mr. Canelo of Bear Stearns agrees If we do have an economic slowdown he says companies with high debt ratios will be dumped en masse .
The best course for individual investors is to sell these stocks now the two advisers say .
SELL WHISPER STOCKS .
UAL Corp. 's difficulty in obtaining bank financing for its leveraged buy-out and its resulting price plunge is a tip-off to what 's going to happen to takeover stocks says Mr. Canelo .
Takeover activity will slow down as more and more banks tighten their lending requirements he says .
There 'll be fewer and fewer deals .
Moreover many financial advisers say individuals should be in the stock market as long-term investors not as traders trying to catch the next hot stock .
In general they say avoid takeover stocks .
COMPARE P\/E RATIOS WITH PROSPECTS .
Mr. Canelo suggests that investors compare price\/earnings ratios the price of a share of stock divided by a company 's per-share earnings for a 12-month period with projected growth rates .
If you think earnings will grow at 20 % a year it 's all right to pay 20 times earnings he says .
But do n't pay 30 times earnings for a company that 's expected to grow at 15 % a year .
Mr. Canelo thinks the market will probably go higher but will be ruthless with stocks if the earnings are n't there .
Mr. Markese cautions that investors should n't slavishly follow any specific price\/earnings sell trigger .
If you say sell anytime a company 's price\/earnings ratio exceeds 15 that knocks out all your growth stocks he says .
You eliminate companies with substantial prospects that are moving up in price .
EXAMINE WHAT HAS CHANGED .
Tom Schlesinger market analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. says investors should consider selling if there has been a fundamental change in a company since they bought its stock .
Say you purchased a stock because of a new product that was in the works .
Now because of various difficulties the product has been scrapped .
Time to sell says Mr. Schlesinger .
Similarly he says suppose you were attracted to a company because of expectations that sales would hit 200 million by 1990 .
If things have n't worked out that well and sales wo n't hit 200 million until 1992 it 's time to consider selling he says .
USX Corp. declined a United Steelworkers request for a reopening of its four-year labor contract that is due to expire Jan. 31 1991 .
The union on Oct. 5 requested that the contract be reopened to restore all pay and benefits that the union gave up in the 1982-83 and 1986-87 rounds of bargaining .
A United Steelworkers spokeman said Lynn Williams the union 's president was out of town .
The union wo n't respond to the USX statement until Mr. Williams has studied it the spokesman said .
Robert A. Oswald chief financial officer and a director of this natural-gas pipeline company was elected to the additional position of executive vice president .
In addition Michael W. O'Donnell executive vice president of a Columbia unit was named assistant chief financial officer and a senior vice president of the parent company .
The appointments take effect Nov. 1 .
Both men are 44 years old .
This magazine and book publisher said three men were elected directors increasing the board to 10 .
They are James R. Eiszner 62 years old and chairman and chief executive officer of CPC International Inc. Robert G. Schwartz 61 chairman president and chief executive officer of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and Walter V. Shipley 53 chairman and chief executive officer of Chemical Banking Corp .
BankAmerica Corp. reported a 34 % jump in third-quarter earnings as its rocket-like recovery from nearly ruinous losses several years ago continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans higher interest margins and negligible loan losses .
For the quarter BankAmerica said it earned 254 million or 1.16 a share compared with 190 million or 97 cents a share a year earlier .
BankAmerica spokesmen said preliminary reports indicate the company was n't materially affected by the Tuesday earthquake .
All but eight of the 850 branches which had some structural damage reopened yesterday for business .
Automated teller machine operations also were up and operating yesterday a bank spokesman said .
For the first time in nearly two years BankAmerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters but the decline from the second quarter was attributable to special factors .
Third-quarter profit was 16 % below the 304 million or 1.50 a share earned in the 1989 second quarter .
The company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter totaling 63 million compared with 28 million in the third quarter .
Excluding tax credits profit was 6 % below the second quarter .
But that drop was caused entirely by a decline in Brazilian interest paid to 5 million from 54 million the second quarter .
Moreover BankAmerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to 170 million about the same as the previous quarter but well above the 100 million in the year-earlier quarter .
The provision rate was far above BankAmerica 's actual net credit losses of 24 million in the third quarter compared with 18 million in the second period and 38 million a year earlier .
As a result BankAmerica said its reserve against troubled foreign-country loans once below 25 % now amounts to 45 % of the 6.4 billion of non-trade debt it calculates it is owed by those nations .
That level is about the same as some other big banks but far below the 85 % and 100 % reserves of Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co. respectively .
By any measure third-quarter earnings were still robust equivalent to a 0.92 % return on assets even excluding tax credits .
By that key measure of operating efficiency BankAmerica turned in a better performance than its well-regarded Los Angeles-based competitor Security Pacific Corp. which posted a 0.89 % return in the third quarter .
But it continued to badly trail its San Francisco neighbor Wells Fargo & Co. which reported an extraordinary 1.25 % return on assets .
Both returns do n't include any tax credits .
They BankAmerica continue to show good performance said Donald K. Crowley an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. San Francisco .
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange BankAmerica common stock edged up 12.5 cents to close at 32 a share .
Shareholder equity improved to 4.68 % from 4.23 % in the previous quarter .
The 4.52 % net interest margin or the difference between the yield on a bank 's investments and the rate it pays for deposits and other borrowings was still markedly higher than the 3.91 % ratio a year earlier and is among the best in the industry analysts said .
The high margin partly stems from continued strong growth in high-yielding consumer loans which jumped 31 % to 17.47 billion from a year earlier and residential mortgages which rose 25 % to 12 billion .
BankAmerica 's total loans rose 8 % to 71.36 billion .
For the nine months BankAmerica profit soared 81 % to 833 million or 4.07 a share from 461 million or 2.40 a share .
International Business Machines Corp. will announce on Tuesday a slew of software products aimed at eliminating some of the major problems involved in computerizing manufacturing operations industry executives said .
Many plant floors currently resemble a Tower of Babel with computers robots and machine tools that generally speak their own language and have trouble talking to each other .
As a result if a problem develops on a production line it is unlikely some supervisor sitting in front of a personal computer or workstation will know about it or be able to correct it .
So IBM will be announcing more than 50 products that will be aimed at letting even the dumbest machine tool talk to the smartest mainframe or anything in between .
In an unusual display of openness IBM also will be helping customers tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by IBM 's competitors .
In addition the executives said IBM will be offering programming tools designed to let anyone working on a factory floor write ad-hoc software for instance to do statistical analysis that would pinpoint a problem on a manufacturing line .
In Armonk N.Y. an IBM spokeswoman confirmed that IBM executives will be announcing some computer-integrated-manufacturing plans next week but declined to elaborate .
The industry executives said that as usual with such broad announcements from IBM this one will be part reality and part strategy .
So it will take many quarters for IBM to roll out all the products that customers need and it will take years for customers to integrate the products into their operations .
Also as usual the products will appeal mostly to heavy users of IBM equipment at least initially .
Still consultants and industry executives said the products could help make manufacturing operations more efficient and provide a boost to the computer-integrated-manufacturing market a market that Yankee Group a research firm has said may double to 40 billion by 1993 .
This is a step in the right direction said Martin Piszczalski a Yankee Group analyst .
He added though that a lot of this is intentions .
We 'll have to wait and see how the plan develops .
The announcements also should help IBM go on the offensive against Digital Equipment Corp. on the plant floor .
While IBM has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools Digital has dominated computerized manufacturing .
Hewlett-Packard Co. also has begun to gain share in the whole computer-integrated-manufacturing arena .
IBM will face an uphill climb against Digital given Digital 's reputation for being better than IBM at hooking together different manufacturers ' computers .
In addition Hewlett-Packard while a much smaller player has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those hookups and could give IBM some problems .
Both can be expected to go after the market aggressively Gartner Group Inc. a research firm estimated the Digital gets 30 % of its revenue from the manufacturing market and Hewlett-Packard gets 50 % .
IBM which Gartner Group said generates 22 % of its revenue in this market should be able to take advantage of its loyal following among buyers of equipment .
That is because many companies will standardize on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge and IBM is the biggest player .
But much will depend on how quickly IBM can move .
The whole idea of computer-integrated manufacturing CIM seems to be making a comeback after losing a little luster over the past couple of years when it became apparent that it was n't a panacea that would make U.S. plants more efficient and banish foreign competition .
Erik Keller a Gartner Group analyst said organizational changes may still be required to really take advantage of CIM 's capabilities someone on the shop floor may not like having someone in an office using a personal computer to look over his shoulder for instance and may be able to prevent that from happening .
But he said a system such as IBM 's should help significantly .
In making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips for instance a chip sometimes does n't melt gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets .
That can be expensive because the problem may not be noticed for a while and the sheets are typically thrown away .
But Mr. Keller said that if computers can be integrated into the process they could alert an operator as soon as the problem occurred .
They could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing to accept a lower grade of polyethylene .
The computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled eliminating waste .
This sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant weapon for some companies .
Companies might be able to tell salespeople daily for instance about idle equipment so they could offer discounts on whatever that equipment produces .
Salespeople also could get a precise reading on when products could be delivered in much the same way that Federal Express has marketed its ability to tell exactly where a package is in the delivery system .
Ford Motor Co. 's Merkur the company 's first new car franchise in the U.S. since the Edsel was unveiled in 1957 now will share Edsel 's fate .
Ford said yesterday it will halt imports of the Merkur Scorpio a 28,000 luxury sedan built by Ford of Europe in West Germany .
The cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of Lincoln-Mercury dealers as opposed to new models such as Taurus or Escort which are sold under existing Ford divisions .
The move to halt imports announced 29 years and 11 months to the day after Henry Ford II declared that the Edsel division and its gawky car would be scrapped kills the four-year-old Merkur brand in the U.S. market .
It will continue to be sold in the European market .
Merkur 's death is n't nearly as costly to Ford as was the Edsel debacle because Merkur was a relatively low-budget project with limited sales goals .
Still Merkur 's demise is a setback for Ford at a time when the company 's image as the U.S. auto maker with the golden touch is showing signs of strain .
The No. 2 auto maker 's new Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar models have n't met sales expectations in the year since they were introduced and Ford 's trucks are losing ground to their GM rivals .
This fall Ford introduced only one new product A restyled version of its hulking Lincoln Town Car luxury model .
The demise of Merkur pronounced mare-COOR comes after a September in which 670 Merkur dealers managed to sell only 93 Scorpios .
Total Merkur sales for the first nine months dropped 46 % from a year ago to just 6,320 cars .
Merkur is n't the only European luxury brand having problems in the U.S. .
The Japanese assault on the luxury market is rapidly overshadowing such European makes as Audi and Saab which at least have clear brand images .
Merkur as an import on domestic car lots suffered from the same sort of image confusion that is hobbling sales of imports at General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp .
Merkur was originally aimed at enticing into Lincoln-Mercury dealerships the kind of young affluent buyers who would n't be caught dead in a Town Car a vehicle so bargelike that Ford is staging a press event next month linking the Town Car 's launch to the commissioning of a new aircraft carrier in Norfolk Va .
But the brand had trouble from the start .
The first Merkur the XR4Ti went on sale in early 1985 .
The sporty coupe foundered in part because American buyers did n't go for the car 's unusual double-wing rear spoiler .
In May 1987 Ford began importing the Scorpio sedan from West Germany to sell next to a redesigned XR4Ti in showrooms .
Ford officials said they expected the two Merkurs would sell about 15,000 cars a year and in 1988 they reached that goal as sales hit 15,261 cars .
It was downhill from there however .
One major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark which began less than a year after Merkur 's 1985 launch .
As the West German currency rose so did Merkur prices .
The Merkur cars also suffered from spotty quality some dealers say .
It was like a comedy of errors says Martin J. Hoot McInerney a big dealer whose Star Lincoln-Mercury-Merkur operation in Southfield Mich. sold more XR4Ti 's than any other dealership .
But by the third quarter of 1988 Scorpios had a high satisfaction rating in internal Ford studies a spokesman said .
Apparently however the improvement came too late .
Last fall Ford announced it would discontinue the XR4Ti in the U.S. at the end of the 1989 model year .
Ford said then it would keep the Scorpio .
This year Scorpio sales plummeted and at the current sales pace it would take Ford 242 days to sell off the current Scorpio inventory of about 4,600 cars .
Canadian Pacific Ltd. said it proposed acquiring the 44 % of Soo Line Corp. it does n't already own for 19.50 a share or about 81.9 million after failing to find a buyer for its majority stake earlier this year .
Soo Line said its board appointed a special committee of independent directors to study the proposal .
The troubled Minneapolis-based railroad concern said the committee has the authority to hire financial and legal advisers to assist it .
The proposed acquisition will be subject to approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission Soo Line said .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Soo Line shares jumped well above the proposed price closing at 20.25 up 2.75 .
Canadian Pacific put its 56 % stake in Soo Line up for sale last year but could n't find any takers .
Canadian Pacific which has interests in transportation telecommunications forest products energy and real estate finally took its majority block off the market this spring .
It turned out we could n't sell it a Canadian Pacific official said adding that acquiring the remainder of Soo Line is now the best way to rationalize operations .
Canadian Pacific is Soo Line 's biggest customer and has owned a majority stake in the U.S. railroad since 1947 .
Canadian Pacific and Soo Line tracks connect at two points in the West on the Canada-U.S. border and the two companies operate a very successful Chicago-Montreal rail service .
Separately for the first nine months Soo Line reported a loss of 398,000 or four cents a share compared with net income of 12.5 million or 1.32 a share a year earlier .
Revenue fell 5.8 % to 407.9 million from 433.2 million .
The company had a loss from operations of 1.7 million .
Golden Nugget Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of 13.1 million or 76 cents a share based on 17.2 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding .
The results compare with a year-earlier net loss of 1.5 million or seven cents a share based on 20.3 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding .
Operating revenue rose 25 % to 52.1 million from 41.8 million a year ago .
Results for the latest quarter include nonoperating items of 23.9 million versus 8.4 million a year earlier .
Most of the expenses stem from the company 's huge Mirage resort-casino scheduled to open next month along the Strip and an April 1989 financing by units operating the downtown Golden Nugget property .
For the nine months Golden Nugget reported a net loss of 11.4 million or 69 cents a share based on 16.6 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding .
The year earlier the company had a net loss of 4.3 million or 20 cents a share based on 21 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding .
The 1988 results include a 10.7 million charge stemming from a litigation judgment .
Separately the casino operator said its board approved a plan to buy-back as many as three million common shares from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions .
An additional 299,000 shares are authorized for repurchase under an earlier stock buy-back program .
John Uphoff an analyst with Raymond James & Associates said the results were n't surprising and attributed the buy-back to management 's confidence in the Mirage 's ability to generate strong cash flow in 1990 .
Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Golden Nugget common closed at 28.25 up 2 .
Capital Holding Corp. said it requested and received the resignation of John A. Franco its vice chairman as an officer and a director of the life insurance holding company .
The company said Mr. Franco developed a plan to establish a business that might be competitive with Capital Holding Corp. 's Accumulation and Investment Group which Mr. Franco headed .
The group temporarily will report to Irving W. Bailey II chairman president and chief executive officer of Capital Holding .
Mr. Franco 47 years old said in a telephone interview that he has been considering and discussing a number of possible business ventures but that nothing is at a mature stage .
He said he did n't argue with the company 's decision to seek his resignation because contemplating outside business ventures can distract an executive from performing his best at the job he is paid to do .
Martin H. Ruby a managing director of Capital Holding 's Accumulation and Investment Group also resigned to pursue other business interests Capital Holding said .
Mr. Ruby 39 said that he had an amicable parting with Capital Holding and that he has a number of ventures in the financial-services area under consideration .
He said that his resignation was a mutual decision with Capital Holding management but that he was n't actually asked to resign .
The Accumulation and Investment Group is responsible for the investment operations of all Capital Holding 's insurance businesses and markets guaranteed investment contracts to bank trust departments and other institutions .
It also sells single-premium annuities to individuals .
Mr. Bailey said he expects to name a new group president to head that operation following the Nov. 8 board meeting .

PLASTIC PENCILS CODE-NAMED E-71 made their hush-hush debut in children 's pencil boxes at five-and-dime stores in 1973 .
But few knew it then and most still think all pencils are wooden .
Eagle Pencil of Shelbyville Tenn. Pencil City U.S.A. had made its earliest pilot plastic pencils in 1971 .
But it was n't until after it hired Arthur D. Little a Cambridge Mass. research concern that its new product was refined for commercial sale in 1973 .
Three A.D.L. inventors applied April 6 1973 for the patent which was assigned and awarded in 1976 to Hasbro Industries then Eagle 's parent .
Pencil pushers chew and put the plastic models behind their ears just like traditional pencils made of glued strips of California incense cedar filled with ceramic lead .
It takes five steps to make standard pencils just one for the plastic type .
Automated machines coextrude long plastic sheaths with graphite-plastic cores that are printed cut painted and eraser-fitted .
After more than 200 years something new has happened to pencils said Arthur D. Little in a 1974 report that publicly described the previously secret item .
Eagle 's plastic type sharpens and looks like a wooden pencil .
A major difference is that a snapped wooden pencil will have a slivered break while a plastic model will break cleanly .
The softness of the core constrains the plastic models to No. 1 No. 2 or No. 3-type pencils which account for the bulk of the market .
Artists and draftsmen need harder leads .
Eagle now called Eagle-Berol remains a leading company among the 10 in the U.S. that produced about 2.3 billion pencils last year according to the Pencil Makers Association .
It 's a trade secret how many were plastic and most writers still do n't know what they 're using .
H.F. Ahmanson & Co. the nation 's largest thrift holding company posted a 12 % earnings decline for the third quarter while another large California savings and loan Great Western Financial Corp. reported a slight earnings gain .
H.F. Ahmanson parent of Home Savings of America reported third-quarter net of 49.2 million or 50 cents a share down from 56.1 million or 57 cents a share in the year-earlier period .
Most of the earnings decline reflected an increase in the company 's effective tax rate to 44 % from 37 % in the year-ago third quarter when nonrecurring tax credits were recorded the company said .
Pretax earnings declined 1.3 % .
For the nine months Los Angeles-based H.F. Ahmanson had profit of 128.1 million or 1.29 a share a 4.6 % decline from earnings of 134.2 million in the year-ago nine months .
The company said the decline was attributable to a 79 % reduction in net gains on loan sales this year .
Third-quarter spreads widened to the highest level in two years as loan portfolio yields rose and money costs declined the company said .
Great Western Financial said third-quarter profit rose slightly to 68.4 million or 52 cents a share from 67.9 million or 53 cents a share from a year ago .
Great Western based in Beverly Hills Calif. is a financial services firm and parent to Great Western Bank an S&L .
Great Western said it had a sharp increase in margins in the recent third quarter .
Margins are the difference between the yield on the company 's earning assets and its own cost of funds .
But a reduction in one-time gains on the sale of various assets and an increase in the company 's provision for loan losses held down the earnings gain the company said .
Great Western 's provision for loan losses was increased to 27.9 million for the recent quarter compared with 21.8 million a year ago primarily as a result of continued weakness in various commercial and multifamily real estate markets outside California .
For the nine months Great Western posted net of 177.5 million or 1.37 a share a 5.9 % decline from 188.7 million or 1.48 a share in the year-ago period .
Dun & Bradstreet Corp. posted a 15 % rise in third-quarter earnings .
But revenue declined more than 2 % reflecting in part a continuing drop in sales of credit services in the wake of controversy over the company 's sales practices .
The information company also cited the stronger dollar the sale last year of its former Official Airline Guides unit and other factors .
Net income rose to a record 155.3 million or 83 cents a share from 134.8 million or 72 cents a share .
Revenue fell to 1.04 billion from 1.07 billion .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Dun & Bradstreet closed yesterday at 53.75 down 25 cents a share .
Analysts said the results were as expected but several added that the earnings masked underlying weaknesses in several businesses .
The quality of earnings was n't as high as I expected said Eric Philo an analyst for Goldman Sachs & Co .
For example he noted operating profit was weaker than he had anticipated but nonoperating earnings of 14.6 million and a lower tax rate helped boost net income .
Dun & Bradstreet said operating earnings rose 8 % excluding the sale of Official Airline Guides .
Third-quarter sales of U.S. credit services were disappointingly below sales of a year earlier Dun & Bradstreet said .
As previously reported those sales have been declining this year in the wake of allegations that the company engaged in unfair sales practices that encouraged customers to overpurchase services .
The company has denied the allegations but has negotiated a proposed 18 million settlement of related lawsuits .
Analysts predict the sales impact will linger .
There is n't much question there will continue to be a ripple effect said John Reidy an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
Dun & Bradstreet noted that price competition in its Nielsen Marketing Research Nielsen Clearing House and Donnelley Marketing businesses also restrained revenue growth .
It cited cyclical conditions in its Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and D&B Plan Services units .
For the nine months net income rose 19 % to 449 million or 2.40 a share from 375.9 million or 2.01 a share a year earlier .
Year-earlier earnings reflected costs of 14.3 million related to the acquisition of IMS International .
Revenue rose slightly to 3.16 billion from 3.13 billion .
Control Data Corp. said it licensed its airline yield-management software to the International Air Transport Association .
Terms include a royalty arrangement but details were n't disclosed .
The computer equipment and financial services company said IATA a trade group will sell access to the package to its 180 airline members world-wide .
Control Data will receive revenue linked to the number of passengers served by the software IATA said .
The package helps carriers solve pricing problems such as how to react to discounts offered by competitors or what would be the optimum number of seats to offer at a given price .
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said it decided to proceed with installation of automatic gauge and shape controls at its 60-inch tandem cold rolling mill in Allenport Pa .
The new equipment which will produce steel sheet with more uniform thickness and flatness is likely to cost more than 20 million the company said .
When the company last considered adding the equipment two years ago it estimated the cost at 21 million to 22 million but a task force will have to prepare a detailed plan before the company can predict the current cost .
The time schedule for installing the equipment also will be developed by the task force the company said .

In the long frightening night after Tuesday 's devastating earthquake Bay Area residents searched for comfort and solace wherever they could .
Some found it on the screen of a personal computer .
Hundreds of Californians made their way to their computers after the quake and checked in with each other on electronic bulletin boards which link computers CB-radio-style via phone lines .
Some of the most vivid bulletins came over The Well a Sausalito Calif. board that is one of the liveliest outposts of the electronic underground .
About two-thirds of the Well 's 3,000 subscribers live in the Bay Area .
The quake knocked The Well out for six hours but when it came back up it teemed with emotional first-hand reports .
Following are excerpts from the electronic traffic that night .

I heard parts of the building above my head cracking .
I actually thought that I might die .
I could n't decide if I should come home to Marin because my house is on stilts .
I decided to brave the storm .
There was a horrible smell of gas as I passed the Chevron refinery before crossing the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge .
I could also see the clouds across the bay from the horrible fire in the Marina District of San Francisco .
I have felt many aftershocks .
My back is still in knots and my hands are still shaking .
I think a few of the aftershocks might just be my body shaking .

MACPOST Downtown Bolinas seems to be the part of town that 's worst off .
No power minimal phones and a mess of mayonnaise wine and everything else all over the floors of the big old general store and the People 's Co-op .
The quivers move through my house every few minutes at unpredictable intervals and the mouse that 's been living in my kitchen has taken refuge under my desk .
It runs out frantically now and then and is clearly pretty distressed .
I was in Stinson Beach when the quake rolled through town .
At first we were unfazed .
Then as things got rougher we ran for the door and spent the next few minutes outside watching the brick sidewalk under our feet oozing up and down and the flowers waving in an eerie rhythm .
Amazing what it does to one 's heart rate and one 's short-term memory .
Everyone looked calm but there was this surreal low level of confusion as the aftershocks continued .
4:02 a.m .
SHIBUMI Power is back on and UCSF medical center seems to have quieted down for the night they were doing triage out in the parking lot from the sound and lights of it .
A friend of mine was in an underground computer center in downtown SF when the quake hit .
He said that one of the computers took a three-foot trip sliding across the floor .
Today should be interesting as people realize how hard life is going to be here for a while .
4:30 a.m .
KIM I got home let the dogs into the house and noticed some sounds above my head as if someone were walking on the roof or upstairs .
Then I noticed the car was bouncing up and down as if someone were jumping on it .
I realized what was happening and screamed into the house for the dogs .
Cupboard doors were flying the trash can in the kitchen walked a few feet the dogs came running and I scooted them into the dog run and stood in the doorway myself watching the outside trash cans dance across the concrete .
When I realized it was over I went and stood out in front of the house waiting and praying for Merrill to come home shivering as if it were 20 below zero until he got there .
Never in my life have I been so frightened .

It 's a flimsy structure built up on supports and it was really rocking around .

Needless to say it was an interesting first session .

We ran into the house to get Mame but the next tremor threw me in the air and bounced me as I tried to get to my feet .
We are all fine here although Mame was extremely freaked .
Kitchen full of broken crystal .
Books and tapes all over my room .
Not one thing in the house is where it is supposed to be but the structure is fine .
While I was standing on the lawn with Mame waiting for another tremor I noticed that all the earthworms were emerging from the ground and slithering across the lawn .

Georgia-Pacific Corp. exceeding some analysts ' expectations said third-quarter earnings rose 56 % to 178 million or 2.03 a share from 114 million or 1.19 a share in the year-earlier period .
Sales increased 10 % to 2.65 billion from 2.41 billion .
Per-share earnings were enhanced by the company 's share buy-back program which reduced the average shares outstanding to 87.5 million in the quarter from 95.8 million in the same quarter of 1988 .
With strong prices in the company 's two major areas building products as well as pulp and paper analysts had expected a roaring quarter .
But the performance exceeded some estimates of around 1.90 a share .
Fueling the growth among other things were higher-than-expected prices for certain building products .
One reason efforts to protect the spotted owl led to restrictions on logging in the Pacific Northwest constricting supply and forcing prices up .
Another reason strikes both at Georgia-Pacific and other lumber companies also cut supplies and raised prices analysts said .
For the nine months Georgia-Pacific 's earnings increased 49 % to 504 million or 5.58 a share from 338 million or 3.41 a share .
Sales rose 11 % to 7.73 billion from 6.94 billion .
In composite New York Stock Exchange Trading Georgia-Pacific stock rose 1.25 a share yesterday to close at 58 .
The House Public Works and Transportation Committee approved a bill that would give the Transportation Department power to block airline leveraged buy-outs despite a clear veto threat from the Bush administration .
The 23-5 vote clears the way for consideration on the House floor next week or the week after .
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner in a letter to the committee warned that he would urge President Bush to veto the legislation if it passed Congress .
The Senate Commerce Committee already has approved similar legislation .
On Monday a letter from Mr. Skinner 's deputy Elaine Chao said the administration opposed the legislation in its present form .
Some of the bill 's supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter was n't signed by Mr. Skinner and that it did n't contain a veto threat .
The stepped-up administration warnings annoyed some lawmakers especially senior Republicans who supported the bill because they thought the Transportation Department favored it .
We backed this bill because we thought it would help Skinner one Republican said and now we 're out there dangling in the wind .
A few weeks ago Mr. Skinner testified before Congress that it would be cleaner more efficient if he had authority to block buy-outs in advance .
But he never took an official position on the bill and has steadfastly maintained that he already has enough authority to deal with buy-outs .
Under the committee bill the Transportation secretary would have 30 days and an additional 20 days if needed to review any proposed purchase of 15 % or more of a major U.S. airline 's voting stock .
The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier 's ability to compete or if it gave control to a foreign interest .
Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt .
Supporters of the bill are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt .
The panel 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market .
It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort Rep. James Oberstar D. Minn. chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee said during the panel 's deliberations .
I do n't believe in the airline business you can be totally laissez-faire because of the high degree of public interest at stake .
But Mr. Skinner disagreed calling the legislation a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry .
In his letter to Committee Chairman Glenn Anderson D. Calif. the secretary also said the bill would be at odds with the administration 's policies welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources .
Currently the Transportation Department does n't have the authority to block a takeover in advance .
However if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier unfit to operate the department may revoke its certificate grounding the airline .
Such authority is more than adequate say opponents of the legislation .
But supporters argue that grounding an airline is so drastic that the department would hesitate doing it .
The panel rejected a proposal pushed by AMR Corp. the parent of American Airlines to allow the Transportation secretary to block corporate raiders from waging proxy fights to oust boards that oppose a leveraged buy-out .
It also voted down proposals to give the secretary much more discretion on whether to block a buy-out and to require the department to consider the impact of a buy-out on workers .
London shares rallied to post strong gains after initial fears evaporated that the California earthquake would depress Wall Street prices .
Tokyo stocks which rebounded strongly Tuesday extended their gains yesterday but most other Asian and Pacific markets closed sharply lower .
In London the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped 34.6 points to close at its intraday high of 2170.1 .
The index was under pressure for most of the morning over concerns that the effects of Tuesday night 's major earthquake in the San Francisco area would undermine the U.S. market .
The mood changed after dealers reappraised the direct impact of the disaster on shares and Wall Street rebounded from early losses .
The Financial Times 30-share index settled 27.8 points higher at 1758.5 .
Volume was 449.3 million shares the slowest of a hectic week compared with 643.4 million Tuesday .
U.K. composite or non-life insurers which some equity analysts said might be heavily hit by the earthquake disaster helped support the London market by showing only narrow losses in early trading .
The insurers ' relative resilience gave the market time to reappraise the impact of the California disaster on U.K. equities dealers said .
Dealers said the market still has n't shaken off its nervousness after its bumpy ride of the past several sessions caused by interest-rate increases last week and Wall Street 's 6.9 % plunge Friday .
But technical factors including modest gains in the value of the pound helped draw buying back into the market and reverse losses posted a day earlier .

B.A.T Industries fell in early dealings but recovered to finish at 754 up 5 .
Dealers said the market was nervous ahead of a special B.A.T holders ' meeting today .
The session is to consider a defensive plan to spin off assets to fend off Sir James Goldsmith 's 13.4 billion bid for B.A.T .
The recent stock market drop has shaken confidence in the plan but dealers said the shares fell initially on questions about whether Mr. Goldsmith 's highly leveraged bid will come to fruition .

On Wednesday shares were pushed up by index-related buying on the part of investment trusts as well as small orders from individuals and corporations traders said .
Institutions meanwhile stepped back to the sidelines as the direction of U.S. interest rates remained unclear .
The uncertainty was multiplied by the persistent strength of the dollar traders said and by the U.S. trade deficit which widened by 31 % in August from the previous month .
Traders and analysts said they did n't see any effect on Tokyo stocks from the California earthquake .
The impact on Japanese insurers and property owners with interests in the San Francisco area is still being assessed they said .
Buying was scattered across a wide range of issues making the session fairly characterless traders said .
With uncertainty still hanging over interest rates and the dollar the market failed to find a focus that might lead to further investor commitments they said .
Some traders said the popularity of issues that gained yesterday wo n't last long as investors will rotate their buying choices over the short term .
Interest rate-sensitive shares such as steel construction and electric utility companies which rose early in the week saw their advance weaken yesterday .
Traders said these issues need large-volume buying to push up their prices so substantial gains are n't likely unless institutional investors participate .
An outstanding issue in yesterday 's session was Mitsubishi Rayon which surged 95 to 905 yen 6.34 a share .
Its popularity was due to speculation about the strong earnings potential of a new type of plastic wrap for household use a trader at County Natwest Securities Japan said .

Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective Geneva .
To make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100 .
The percentage change is since year-end .
Housing construction sank in September to its lowest level since the last recession the Commerce Department reported .
Work began on homes and apartments at an annual rate of 1,263,000 units last month down 5.2 % from August the department said .
The September decline followed an even steeper drop of 6.2 % in August and left housing starts at their weakest since October 1982 when the country was nearing the end of a recession .
Originally the department had reported the August decline as 5 % .
The numbers suggest that the housing industry is still suffering the effects of the Federal Reserve 's battle against inflation .
The industry had shown signs of recovery this summer after the central bank began to relax its
