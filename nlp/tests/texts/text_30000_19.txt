rcement efforts are working here albeit at a slower and more halting pace than we would like .
He acknowledged however that Washington 's drug-related murder rate is intolerably high .
The prisons are too crowded .
Drugs continue to be sold openly around schools parks and housing projects .
Mr. Bennett declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease Washington 's problem .
But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state .
Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city .
In a letter to Mr. Bennett 's office released yesterday Washington 's city administrator Carol Thompson complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital .
Referring to Mr. Bennett 's claim that the federal government would provide 97 million in emergency federal support Ms. Thompson wrote Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure .
Of his successes in Washington Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates .
He also noted that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration has established a federal-local task force responsible since April for 106 arrests and more than 2 million in seizures of drug dealers ' assets .
The Defense Department has lent the Washington U.S. attorney 10 prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has provided crime laboratory facilities and training he added .
What if it happened to us .
In the wake of the earthquake in California and the devastation of Hurricane Hugo many companies in disaster-prone areas are pondering the question of preparedness .
Some particularly in West Coast earthquake zones are dusting off their evacuation plans checking food stocks and reminding employees of what to do if emergency strikes .
Others say they feel confident that steps they 've already taken would see them through a disaster .
Preparedness involves more than flashlights and fire alarms these days .
Some big companies have teams of in-house experts focusing on safety and business resumption .
Many companies in the path of potential disaster have set up contingency offices in safe regions hoping they can transport employees there and resume operations quickly .
That means making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm 's way .
Some businesses like Disneyland claim that even if they became isolated in a crisis they would be able to feed and care for their people for as long as five days .
Self-sufficiency has to be the cornerstone of your plan says Stephanie Masaki-Schatz manager of corporate emergency planning at Atlantic Richfield Co. in Los Angeles .
If you do n't save your critical people you wo n't be able to bring up your vital business functions .
Although ARCO 's head office more than 300 miles from the epicenter was n't affected by this week 's tremors Ms. Masaki-Schatz used the occasion to distribute a three-page memo of Earthquake Tips to 1,200 ARCO employees .
You need to capitalize on these moments when you have everyone 's attention she says .
It was a good reminder that we all need to prepare prior to an event .
The ARCO memo urges employees to keep certain supplies at work such as solid shoes and heavy gloves to clear debris .
It also recommends that employees be aware of everyday office items that could be used for emergency care or shelter .
Among the suggestions Pantyhose and men 's ties could be used for slings while removable wooden shelves might aid in breaking through office walls .
ARCO maintains an office in Dallas that would take over if payroll operations in Pasadena were disrupted .
Two months ago the company set up a toll-free number based outside California to handle queries from employees about when they should report back to work after an earthquake or other disaster .
The ARCO plan takes into account such details as which aspects of business are busier at certain times of the year .
This way depending on when a quake might strike priorities can be assigned to departments that should be brought back on line first .
At Hewlett-Packard Co. the earthquake came just as the company was reviewing its own emergency procedures .
We were talking about scheduling a practice drill for November says Joan Tharp a spokeswoman .
Then we had a real one in the afternoon .
The Palo Alto Calif. computer maker scrambled to set up a special phone line to tell manufacturing and support staff to stay home Wednesday .
Sales and service employees were asked to report to work to help Bay area clients who called with computer problems .
Hewlett-Packard also called in its systems experts to restore its own computer operations .
That means we can accept orders and begin getting back to normal says Ms. Tharp .
Prompted by an earlier California earthquake as well as a fire in a Los Angeles office tower Great Western Bank in the past year hired three emergency planners and spent 75,000 equipping a trailer with communications gear to serve as an emergency headquarters .
Although officials of the savings and loan a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. used some of their new plans and equipment during this week 's quake they still lost touch for more than 24 hours with 15 branches in the affected areas not knowing if employees were injured or vaults were broken open .
Some people flat out did n't know what to do says Robert G. Lee vice president for emergency planning and corporate security at Great Western .
As it turned out bank employees were n't hurt and the vaults withstood the jolts .
Still says Mr. Lee We need to educate people that they need to get to a phone somehow some way to let someone know what their status is .
Some companies are confident that they 're prepared .
Occidental Petroleum Corp. holds regular evacuation drills and stocks food oxygen and non-prescription drugs at checkpoints in its 16-story headquarters .
The company also maintains rechargeable flashlights in offices and changes its standby supply of drinking water every three months .
We feel we are doing everything we can an Occidental spokesman says .
Walt Disney Co. 's Disneyland in Anaheim Calif. stocks rescue equipment medical supplies and enough food and water to feed at least 10,000 visitors for as long as five days in the event that a calamity isolates the theme park .
The park also has emergency centers where specially trained employees would go to coordinate evacuation and rescue plans using walkie-talkies cellular phones and a public-address system .
The centers are complete with maps detailing utility lines beneath rides and safe havens where people can be assembled away from major structures .
Vista Chemical Co. with three chemical plants in and near Lake Charles La. prepares for every hurricane that enters the Gulf of Mexico says Keith L. Fogg a company safety director .
Hurricane Hugo an Atlantic storm did n't affect Vista .
But two other major storms have threatened operations so far this year most recently Hurricane Jerry this week .
Because hurricanes can change course rapidly the company sends employees home and shuts down operations in stages the closer a storm gets the more complete the shutdown .
The company does n't wait until the final hours to get ready for hurricanes .
There are just tons of things that have to be considered Mr. Fogg says .
Empty tank cars will float away on you if you get a big tidal surge .
Still Vista officials realize they 're relatively fortunate .
With a hurricane you know it 's coming .
You have time to put precautionary mechanisms in place notes a Vista spokeswoman .
A situation like San Francisco is so frightening because there 's no warning .
Former Democratic fund-raiser Thomas M. Gaubert whose savings and loan was wrested from his control by federal thrift regulators has been granted court permission to sue the regulators .
In a ruling by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans Mr. Gaubert received the go-ahead to pursue a claim against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas for losses he suffered when the Bank Board closed the Independent American Savings Association of Irving Texas .
Mr. Gaubert who was chairman and the majority stockholder of Independent American had relinquished his control in exchange for federal regulators ' agreement to drop their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan .
As part of the agreement Mr. Gaubert contributed real estate valued at 25 million to the assets of Independent American .
While under the control of federal regulators Independent American 's net worth dropped from 75 million to a negative 400 million wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert 's real estate contribution and his stock in the institution .
Mr. Gaubert 's suit to recover his damages was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney of Dallas under the Federal Tort Claims Act which offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees .
Earlier this week a Fifth Circuit appellate panel upheld Judge Maloney 's dismissal of Mr. Gaubert 's claim as a shareholder but said the judge should reconsider Mr. Gaubert 's claim for the loss of his property .
It may depend on whether there was an express or implied promise that the federal officials would not negligently cause the deterioration of Independent American the court wrote .
Mr. Gaubert 's lawyer Abbe David Lowell of Washington D.C. says the impact of the ruling on other cases involving thrift takeovers will depend on the degree of similarity in the facts .
I do n't know if this will affect one institution or a hundred Mr. Lowell says .
It does establish a very clear precedent for suing the FHLBB where there was none before .
MAITRE'D CLAIMS in suit that restaurant fired her because she was pregnant .
In a suit filed in state court in Manhattan the American Civil Liberties Union is representing the former maitre 'd of the chic Odeon restaurant .
The suit which seeks compensatory and punitive damages of 1 million alleges that the firing of Marcia Trees Levine violated New York state 's human-rights law .
Among other things the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy .
The suit alleges that Ms. Levine was fired after she refused to accept a lower paying less visible job upon reaching her sixth month of pregnancy .
Ms. Levine told her employer that she was pregnant in February a month later the suit says the restaurant manager told Ms. Levine that she would be demoted to his assistant because he felt customers would be uncomfortable with a pregnant maitre 'd .
Kary Moss an attorney with the ACLU 's Women 's Rights Project said They wanted a svelte-looking woman and a pregnant woman is not svelte .
They told her We do n't hire fat people and we do n't hire cripples .
And pregnant women are fat .
Ms. Moss said Ms. Levine secretly taped many conversations with her bosses at the Odeon in which they told her she was being fired as maitre 'd because she was pregnant .
Paul H. Aloe an attorney for Odeon owner Keith McNally denied the allegations .
He said Ms. Levine had never been fired although she had stopped working at the restaurant .
The Odeon made a written offer to Marcia Levine on July 10 to return to work as the maitre 'd at the same pay same hours and with back pay accrued he said .
Mr. Aloe said the Odeon has no policy against hiring pregnant people .
LAWYERS IN Texas 's biggest bank-fraud case want out in face of retrial .
Lawyers representing five of the seven defendants in the case say their clients can no longer afford their services .
The trial of the case lasted seven months and ended in September with a hung jury .
The defendants were indicted two years ago on charges that they conspired to defraud five thrifts of more than 130 million through a complicated scheme to inflate the price of land and condominium construction along Interstate 30 east of Dallas .
The defense lawyers three of whom are solo practitioners say they ca n't afford to put their law practices on hold for another seven-month trial .
Some of the lawyers say they would continue to represent their clients if the government pays their tab as court-appointed lawyers .
Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Hart of Dallas says the government will oppose any efforts to bring in a new defense team because it would delay a retrial .
FEDERAL JUDGE ALCEE HASTINGS of Florida facing impeachment received an unanticipated boost yesterday .
Sen. Arlen Specter R. Pa .
urged acquittal of the judge in a brief circulated to his Senate colleagues during closed-door deliberations .
Among other things the brief cited insufficient evidence .
Sen. Specter was vice chairman of the impeachment trial committee that heard evidence in the Hastings case last summer .
A former prosecutor and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Sen. Specter is expected to exercise influence when the Senate votes on the impeachment today .

New York Times Co. 's third-quarter earnings report is reinforcing analysts ' belief that newspaper publishers will be facing continued poor earnings comparisons through 1990 .
The publisher was able to register soaring quarter net income because of a onetime gain on the sale of its cable-TV system .
However operating profit fell 35 % to 16.4 million .
The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines lower earnings from the forest-products group and what is proving to be a nagging major problem continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times the company 's flagship daily newspaper .
In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange New York Times closed at 28.125 a share down 37.5 cents .
Analysts said the company 's troubles mirror those of the industry .
Retail advertising which often represents half of the advertising volume at most daily newspapers largely is n't rebounding in the second half from extended doldrums as expected .
At the same time newspapers are bedeviled by lagging national advertising especially in its financial component .
Dow Jones & Co. recently reported net fell 9.9 % a reflection in part of continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine .
We expect next year to be a fairly soft year in newspaper-industry advertising said John Morton an analyst for Lynch Jones & Ryan .
Next year earnings will hold steady but we just do n't see a big turnaround in the trend in advertising .
John S. Reidy an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said The Times faces the same problem of other publishers linage is down .
It will be hard to do handstands until real linage starts heading back up .
In the quarterly report Arthur Ochs Sulzberger New York Times Co. chairman and chief executive officer said negative factors affecting third-quarter earnings will continue .
Analysts agreed with company expectations that operating profit will be down this year and in 1990 .
Mr. Sulzberger said the scheduled opening of a new color-printing plant in Edison N.J. in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs .
With the Edison plant coming on line next summer the Times is facing some tough earnings comparison in the future said Peter Appert an analyst with C.J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell .
But many newspapers are facing similar comparisons .
The sale of the company 's cable franchise brought an after-tax gain of 193.3 million part of which will be used to reduce debt .
The company also has a stock-repurchase plan .
Analysts said they were impressed by the performance of the company 's newspaper group which consists of the Times 35 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in the International Herald Tribune group operating profit for the quarter increased slightly to 34.9 million from 34.5 million on flat revenue .
Drexel Burnham 's Mr. Reidy pointed out that profits held up in a tough revenue environment .
That 's a good sign when profits are stable during a time revenue is in the trough .
Investors celebrated the second anniversary of Black Monday with a buying spree in both stocks and bonds .
But the dollar was mixed .
Stock and bond investors were cheered by last month 's encouragingly low inflation rate .
This news raised hopes for further interest-rate cuts .
Treasury-bond prices immediately rallied setting the stock market rolling from the opening bell .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average up about 60 points in mid-afternoon finished with a gain of 39.55 points to 2683.20 .
That brought the average 's cumulative gain this week to about 114 points .
Since the 1987 crash the industrials have soared more than 54 % and the widely watched market barometer is about 4 % below its record high set earlier this month .
The stock-market rally was led by blue-chip issues but unlike Monday 's rebound was broadly based .
Indeed over-the-counter stocks led by technology issues outleaped the industrial average .
The Nasdaq Composite Index soared 7.52 or 1.6 % to 470.80 its highest one-day jump in points this year .
Many takeover-related stocks rose after news that a group obtained financing commitments for the proposed buy-out of American Medical International Inc .
Among the biggest winners were brokerage-house stocks responding to heavy trading volume .
The government said consumer prices rose only 0.2 % last month .
Economists expected twice as large an increase .
That news plus recent signs of economic sluggishness greatly increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease credit further which in turn would be good news for stocks investment managers say .
I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt said Garnett L. Keith Jr. vice chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of America one of the nation 's largest institutional investors .
Fed officials probably wo n't drive down rates immediately Mr. Keith said .
Despite the inflation news several Fed officials still fear consumer-price pressures will intensify because they insist the economy is stronger than generally believed .
But Wall Street analysts expect further signs of economic weakness in government reports during the next few weeks .
If so that will cinch the case for another shot of credit-easing within a month or so .
That in turn is expected to persuade banks to cut their prime lending rate a benchmark rate on many corporate and consumer loans by half a percentage point to 10 % .
We 're not out of the woods yet by any means said George R. Mateyo president and chief executive of Carnegie Capital Management Co. Cleveland .
But the economy is slowing enough to give the Federal Reserve leeway to reduce interest rates .
But many individual investors are leery about stocks because of fresh signs of fragility in the huge junk-bond market .
Investors also are anxious about today 's witching hour the monthly expiration of stock-index futures and options and options on individual stocks .
This phenomenon often makes stock prices swing wildly at the end of the trading session .
In major market activity Stock prices surged in heavy trading .
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 198.1 million shares from 166.9 million Wednesday .
Gaining Big Board issues outnumbered decliners by 1,235 to 355 .
The dollar was mixed .
In New York late yesterday it was at 141.70 yen up from 141.45 yen late Wednesday .
But it fell to 1.8470 marks from 1.8485 .
Tuesday 's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that has n't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that at least at the federal level political ticket splitting has been on the rise over the past half century .
In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20 % of the nation 's congressional districts choose a different party 's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives .
Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 % .
As we know voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress .
In every presidential election over the past half century except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress .
Prior to 1932 the pattern was nearly the opposite .
What accounts for the results of recent decades .
A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth .
The theory relies on three assumptions 1 Voters can buy one of two brands when they select their political agents a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .
2 Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office dealing with national issues programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the population at large and attending to local issues constituency service and pork barrel .
3 Republican congressional representatives because of their belief in a minimalist state are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress .
If these assumptions hold voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive at the margin to lean Democratic .
If they put a Republican into office not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from bringing home the bacon to their respective constituencies .
Each legislator after all is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making .
In races for the White House a voter 's incentive at the margin is to lean Republican .
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district\/state such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts\/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits .
The individual voter 's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes .
While this theory is exceedingly simple it appears to explain several things .
First why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe .
Second it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency .
Third the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office .
For example first-term members of the House once the most vulnerable of incumbents have become virtually immune to defeat .
The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 .
Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role spreading the Reagan revolution in national policy making they were more vulnerable to defeat .
Fourth the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office .
Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent .
To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates .
Fifth the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South .
To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office .
Finally the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House .
Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts .
Is there any empirical support for this theory .
Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues .
First economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do .
To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns .
Second if the key assumption is valid Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking .
This is indeed what the data indicate particularly in the case of the House .
The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 .
Finally as shown in the table Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices .
An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 when control of that body changed party hands moreover reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise due to their majority-party status over other resources such as committee staff .
An additional piece of evidence from the Senate Holding other factors constant such as incumbency advantages and regional factors the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder .
Put more simply GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe .
Moreover ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level .
State government is more typically split along Republican-governor\/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse .
A cross-state econometric investigation furthermore reveals that holding other factors constant the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate .
In sum at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation .
Mr. Zupan teaches at the University of Southern California 's business school .
A House-Senate conference approved a nearly 17 billion State Justice and Commerce Department bill that makes federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement after next Oct. 1 .
The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then but beginning in fiscal 1991 the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as 500 million until the total liability of approximately 1.25 billion is paid .
The action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparat
