s says the company does n't compute much less disclose inflation-adjusted same-store sales .
He adds that short-term comparisons can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year .
Profit margins at company-owned McDonald 's outlets in the U.S. are holding up quite nicely says Mr. Greenberg .
Profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s he adds .
But Mr. Greenberg 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers .
Smaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail many in the industry predict .
Big franchise groups can ride out the storm a lot longer says Mr. Harty the Burger King operator in New York .
The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees .
Mr. Morrissey the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties or portion of sales that they must pay franchisers .
Franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting .
But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end says Lew Rudnick a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients .
He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing .
In any case many franchisees in order to stay on good terms with franchisers routinely go along with promotions .
Says Mr. Riese of National Restaurants If you resisted on prices maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise .

CalMat Co. said it completed a 32.8 million sale of assets from its Los Angeles area real estate portfolio for net income of 12 million .
CalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt concrete rock and sand .
And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an IRS audit .
Reggie Jackson the retired baseball star has found another use for them .
Mr. Jackson who won the nickname Mr. October for his World Series exploits is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as 500 each .
Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. Jackson 's canceled checks is unusual .
I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it says Jack Smalling a dealer in Ames Iowa and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs .
An initial batch of Mr. Jackson 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend .
Mr. Jackson showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well .
For someone who has everything else Reggie 's jersey cap and cards his checks might be a nice addition says William Vizas owner of Bill 's Sports Collectibles in Denver who examined the checks at the San Francisco card show .
For years the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold .
But these players were dead .
Maybe three years ago there were a lot of Ty Cobbs in the hobby and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks says Mr. Smalling .
However the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way .
Maybe I 'm a little stuffy but I would n't sell them sniffs Bob Machon owner of Papa 's Sports Cards in Menlo Park Calif .
Who knows how much they 'll be worth 100 years from now .
And Mr. Smalling does n't believe they 're worth all that much now .
I do n't think the checks are worth 15 apiece he says .
Why Mr. Jackson who could n't be reached for comment has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear .
He probably has n't done it for the cash .
I would say he 's definitely not in need of money says Matt Merola an agent of Mr. Jackson 's based in New York .
He has good investments .
And Mr. Jackson probably has opened new checking accounts too .
Or at least he should .
I assume those accounts are closed says Mr. Smalling referring to the accounts of the canceled checks .
I do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers .
USX Corp. and its Japanese partner Kobe Steel Ltd. agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products mainly for the automotive market .
Terms were n't disclosed for the plant which will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons .
The move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies .
Bethlehem Steel Corp. LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel .
The surge in production analysts say raises questions about capacity outpacing demand .
They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 when the current import trade restraint program ends which could result in more imports .
There 's too much capacity contended Charles Bradford an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
I do n't think there 's anyone not building one .
He does add however that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos instead of relying heavily on imported steel .
That trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet .
The hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills those spun off to employees .
Indeed USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 .
For the first eight months of 1989 analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % .
USX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 .
USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production .
Moreover it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons .
The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines .
Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel .
One of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly .
ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment the rest is easy right .
You just call your broker and say buy or sell .
Dream on .
There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing .
So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges .
Two things to keep in mind Not all exchanges accept every type of order .
And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer .
Market Order This is probably the most widely used order and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers since it imposes no price restrictions .
With a market order an investor tells a broker to buy or sell at the market .
It 's like saying get me in now or get me out now .
For example if wheat is being offered at 4.065 and bid at 4.060 a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price .
A recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers .
Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers .
Limit Order Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment .
Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it .
Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than 55 .
A limit order to sell could be entered at that price .
One risk Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls .
Unless the market goes at least one tick the smallest price increment permitted beyond the limit price investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price .
Stop Order Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level .
Once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get .
Stop orders are sometimes called stop-loss orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses .
While stop orders sound similar to limit orders there is a difference Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above .
In contrast sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below .
The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do .
An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at 90 under a stock that was trading at 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday .
Stop-Limit Order Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order .
Unlike stop orders which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price .
If it ca n't be made at that price it does n't get filled .
Investors who wish to be out of a position without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled .
But if the market moves quickly enough it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price .
Market-If-Touched Order Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached .
However unlike a buy-stop order a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it .
As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price .
Fill-Or-Kill Order The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades .
It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better .
But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately the order is automatically canceled .
Gregory Bessemer who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options .
I like to use them to feel out the market he says .
If they do n't fill it immediately then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price .
Not-Held Order This is another timing order .
It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment if they think they can get a better price by waiting .
Not-held orders which are also known as disregard the tape orders are always done at the customer 's risk .
One-Cancels-The-Other Order This is really two orders in one generally for the same security or commodity instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order .
In a fast-moving market it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security .
Specific-Time Order This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time .
On the close can be added to many types of orders .
For example market-on-close orders must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange .
Stop-close-only orders are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading .
Day orders expire at the end of the day on which they are entered good-till-canceled orders have no expiration date .
Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise .
On Oct. 19 1987 some investors learned the consequences of entering good-til-canceled limit orders and then forgetting about them .
They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel .
It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed .
Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are usually stuck with the consequences .
Mr. Angrist writes on the options and commodities markets for The Wall Street Journal .
IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments there 's probably no starting place better than beta .
But investors better not ignore its limitations either .
Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund .
For any given move in the overall market it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall .
Beta figures are widely available
