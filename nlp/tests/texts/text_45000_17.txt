Georgia-Pacific Corp. exceeding some analysts ' expectations said third-quarter earnings rose 56 % to 178 million or 2.03 a share from 114 million or 1.19 a share in the year-earlier period .
Sales increased 10 % to 2.65 billion from 2.41 billion .
Per-share earnings were enhanced by the company 's share buy-back program which reduced the average shares outstanding to 87.5 million in the quarter from 95.8 million in the same quarter of 1988 .
With strong prices in the company 's two major areas building products as well as pulp and paper analysts had expected a roaring quarter .
But the performance exceeded some estimates of around 1.90 a share .
Fueling the growth among other things were higher-than-expected prices for certain building products .
One reason efforts to protect the spotted owl led to restrictions on logging in the Pacific Northwest constricting supply and forcing prices up .
Another reason strikes both at Georgia-Pacific and other lumber companies also cut supplies and raised prices analysts said .
For the nine months Georgia-Pacific 's earnings increased 49 % to 504 million or 5.58 a share from 338 million or 3.41 a share .

The House Public Works and Transportation Committee approved a bill that would give the Transportation Department power to block airline leveraged buy-outs despite a clear veto threat from the Bush administration .
The 23-5 vote clears the way for consideration on the House floor next week or the week after .
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner in a letter to the committee warned that he would urge President Bush to veto the legislation if it passed Congress .
The Senate Commerce Committee already has approved similar legislation .
On Monday a letter from Mr. Skinner 's deputy Elaine Chao said the administration opposed the legislation in its present form .
Some of the bill 's supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter was n't signed by Mr. Skinner and that it did n't contain a veto threat .
The stepped-up administration warnings annoyed some lawmakers especially senior Republicans who supported the bill because they thought the Transportation Department favored it .
We backed this bill because we thought it would help Skinner one Republican said and now we 're out there dangling in the wind .
A few weeks ago Mr. Skinner testified before Congress that it would be cleaner more efficient if he had authority to block buy-outs in advance .
But he never took an official position on the bill and has steadfastly maintained that he already has enough authority to deal with buy-outs .
Under the committee bill the Transportation secretary would have 30 days and an additional 20 days if needed to review any proposed purchase of 15 % or more of a major U.S. airline 's voting stock .
The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier 's ability to compete or if it gave control to a foreign interest .
Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt .
Supporters of the bill are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt .
The panel 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market .
It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort Rep. James Oberstar D. Minn. chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee said during the panel 's deliberations .
I do n't believe in the airline business you can be totally laissez-faire because of the high degree of public interest at stake .
But Mr. Skinner disagreed calling the legislation a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry .
In his letter to Committee Chairman Glenn Anderson D. Calif. the secretary also said the bill would be at odds with the administration 's policies welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources .
Currently the Transportation Department does n't have the authority to block a takeover in advance .
However if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier unfit to operate the department may revoke its certificate grounding the airline .
Such authority is more than adequate say opponents of the legislation .
But supporters argue that grounding an airline is so drastic that the department would hesitate doing it .
The panel rejected a proposal pushed by AMR Corp. the parent of American Airlines to allow the Transportation secretary to block corporate raiders from waging proxy fights to oust boards that oppose a leveraged buy-out .
It also voted down proposals to give the secretary much more discretion on whether to block a buy-out and to require the department to consider the impact of a buy-out on workers .
London shares rallied to post strong gains after initial fears evaporated that the California earthquake would depress Wall Street prices .
Tokyo stocks which rebounded strongly Tuesday extended their gains yesterday but most other Asian and Pacific markets closed sharply lower .
In London the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped 34.6 points to close at its intraday high of 2170.1 .
The index was under pressure for most of the morning over concerns that the effects of Tuesday night 's major earthquake in the San Francisco area would undermine the U.S. market .
The mood changed after dealers reappraised the direct impact of the disaster on shares and Wall Street rebounded from early losses .
The Financial Times 30-share index settled 27.8 points higher at 1758.5 .
Volume was 449.3 million shares the slowest of a hectic week compared with 643.4 million Tuesday .
U.K. composite or non-life insurers which some equity analysts said might be heavily hit by the earthquake disaster helped support the London market by showing only narrow losses in early trading .
The insurers ' relative resilience gave the market time to reappraise the impact of the California disaster on U.K. equities dealers said .
Dealers said the market still has n't shaken off its nervousness after its bumpy ride of the past several sessions caused by interest-rate increases last week and Wall Street 's 6.9 % plunge Friday .
But technical factors including modest gains in the value of the pound helped draw buying back into the market and reverse losses posted a day earlier .
Among composite insurers General Accident rose 10 pence to 10.03 15.80 a share Guardian Royal climbed 5 to 217 pence Sun Alliance rose 3 to 290 and Royal Insurance jumped 12 to 450 .
Life insurers fared similarly with Legal & General advancing 3 to 344 although Prudential fell 2 to 184 1\/2 .
Pearl Group rose 5 to 628 and Sun Life finished unchanged at 10.98 .
Most banking issues retreated after a sector downgrade by Warburg Securities although National Westminister showed strength on positive comments from brokerage firms about its long-term prospects .
NatWest the most actively traded of the banks finished at 300 up 1 .
B.A.T Industries fell in early dealings but recovered to finish at 754 up 5 .
Dealers said the market was nervous ahead of a special B.A.T holders ' meeting today .
The session is to consider a defensive plan to spin off assets to fend off Sir James Goldsmith 's 13.4 billion bid for B.A.T .
The recent stock market drop has shaken confidence in the plan but dealers said the shares fell initially on questions about whether Mr. Goldsmith 's highly leveraged bid will come to fruition .

In early trading in Tokyo Thursday the Nikkei index rose 135.09 points to 35242.65 .
On Wednesday shares were pushed up by index-related buying on the part of investment trusts as well as small orders from individuals and corporations traders said .
Institutions meanwhile stepped back to the sidelines as the direction of U.S. interest rates remained unclear .
The uncertainty was multiplied by the persistent strength of the dollar traders said and by the U.S. trade deficit which widened by 31 % in August from the previous month .
Traders and analysts said they did n't see any effect on Tokyo stocks from the California earthquake .
The impact on Japanese insurers and property owners with interests in the San Francisco area is still being assessed they said .
Buying was scattered across a wide range of issues making the session fairly characterless traders said .
With uncertainty still hanging over interest rates and the dollar the market failed to find a focus that might lead to further investor commitments they said .
Some traders said the popularity of issues that gained yesterday wo n't last long as investors will rotate their buying choices over the short term .
Interest rate-sensitive shares such as steel construction and electric utility companies which rose early in the week saw their advance weaken yesterday .
Traders said these issues need large-volume buying to push up their prices so substantial gains are n't likely unless institutional investors participate .
An outstanding issue in yesterday 's session was Mitsubishi Rayon which surged 95 to 905 yen 6.34 a share .
Its popularity was due to speculation about the strong earnings potential of a new type of plastic wrap for household use a trader at County Natwest Securities Japan said .
Some laggard food issues attracted bargain-hunters traders said .
Kirin Brewery was up 100 at 2,000 and Ajinomoto gained 70 to 2,840 .

Housing construction sank in September to its lowest level since the last recession the Commerce Department reported .
Work began on homes and apartments at an annual rate of 1,263,000 units last month down 5.2 % from August the department said .
The September decline followed an even steeper drop of 6.2 % in August and left housing starts at their weakest since October 1982 when the country was nearing the end of a recession .
Originally the department had reported the August decline as 5 % .
The numbers suggest that the housing industry is still suffering the effects of the Federal Reserve 's battle against inflation .
The industry had shown signs of recovery this summer after the central bank began to relax its clamp on credit allowing interest rates to drop a bit after pushing them up for a year .
Sales of new homes rose and inventories of houses which had been climbing dropped .
But last month new construction in all types of homes waned from single-family houses to large apartment complexes .
It 's pretty much weak across the board said Martin Regalia chief economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions .
Mr. Regalia said the industry may be reluctant to step up building at the moment for fear the inventories of unsold homes will increase again .
Another reason for the weakness he said may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in March .
In August rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages started creeping up a bit but they inched down again through September .
Rates have n't really peeled off that much Mr. Regalia said .
We 've kind of settled now into an interest-rate environment that 's fairly high .
Work was begun on single family homes the core of the housing market at an annual rate of 971,000 in September a drop of 2.1 % from the previous month .
That followed a 3.3 % decline in August .
Construction of apartments and other multi-family dwellings slipped 2.2 % to an annual rate of 1,022,000 following a 3.5 % decline in August .
The number of building permits issued for future construction dropped 2.4 % to a 1,296,000 annual rate after rising 3.7 % in August .
All the numbers were adjusted for normal seasonal variations in building activity .
The housing starts numbers however are one of the least precise of the government 's economic indicators and are often revised significantly as more information is collected .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. posted a sharp third-quarter turnaround from a year earlier but net income would have dropped from the second quarter without a 37 million after-tax gain .
The securities firm posted third-quarter net of 66 million or 64 cents a share compared with a restated year-earlier loss of 3 million or 11 cents a share .
Revenue climbed 25 % to 3.3 billion from 2.6 billion .
The latest period included the gain which was 77 million before tax from the previously announced sale of the institutional money management business of Lehman Management Co .
The 1988 period was restated from net income of 8 million to correct an overstatement in the company 's Boston Co. subsidiary .
In the 1989 second quarter Shearson had net income of 55 million or 54 cents a share .
An average 102.5 million common shares were outstanding in the latest quarter up from 87.1 million .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Shearson shares lost 37.5 cents to 18.125 .
The company said the improved performance from a year ago reflects higher commissions and revenue from marketmaking and trading for its own account .
Commission revenue was 522 million up 49 % .
But industrywide trading activity slowed in September as institutional investors turned cautious and individuals continued to shy away from the market .
Investment banking revenue fell 32 % to 205 million in part reflecting the continued slowdown of the underwriting business .
In the nine months net fell 3 % to 106 million or 98 cents a share from 110 million or 1.05 a share .
Revenue advanced 26 % to 9.6 billion from 7.6 billion .
Two major drug companies posted strong third-quarter earnings in line with profits already reported by industry leaders and analysts ' expectations .
But Pfizer Inc. based in New York reported flat earnings .
Schering-Plough Corp. based in Madison N.J. reported a 21 % rise in earnings as American Home Products Corp. of New York posted an 11 % increase in net .
American Home Products American Home Products said sales and earnings for the third quarter and nine months were at record levels .
Sales for the third quarter increased 6.5 % to 1.51 billion from 1.42 billion .
Sales of health-care products increased 6 % in the third quarter based in part on strong sales of prescription drugs such as Premarin an estrogen-replacement drug and sales of the company 's infant formula .
American Home Products said net income benefited from a lower effective tax rate reflecting a reduction of foreign tax rates and additional operations in Puerto Rico .
Net also was aided by a gain on the sale of the company 's equity interests in South Africa effective Sept. 1 .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday American Home Products closed at 102.25 a share down 75 cents .
Pfizer Pfizer said third-quarter sales increased 4 % to 1.44 billion from 1.38 billion .
The company said net income was flat because of investment in research and development and costs related to launches of several products .
The company said the dollar 's continued strengthening reduced world-wide sales growth by three percentage points .
Pfizer posted its largest gains in healthcare sales up 3 % and consumer products up 23 % .
Sales by the specialty chemicals and materials science segments were flat and sales by the agriculture segment declined 5 % .
In the health-care segment pharmaceutical sales increased 4 % and sales of hospital products increased 1 % .
During the quarter Pfizer received federal approval of Procardia XL a calcium channel blocker approved for both angina and hypertension and Monorail Piccolino used to open obstructed coronary arteries .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Pfizer closed at 67.75 a share up 75 cents .
Schering-Plough Schering-Plough said sales gained 2.7 % to 743.7 million from 724.4 million .
In the period the company completed the sale of its European cosmetics businesses sold a majority interest in its Brazilian affiliate and announced the reorganization of its over-the-counter drug businesses into a new unit Schering-Plough Health Care Products .
These actions did n't affect results because the gain on the sale of the European cosmetics businesses was offset by provisions relating to the Brazil divestiture and drug restructuring .
U.S. pharmaceutical sales rose 15 % led by allergy asthma and cold products dermatological products anti-infectives and anti-cancer products and cardiovascular products .
World-wide consumer product sales declined 12 % primarily because of the European cosmetics sale .
Significantly lower sales of Stay Trim diet aids also were a factor in the drop .
The Maybelline beauty product line had higher sales following a sluggish first half .
In Big Board composite trading Schering-Plough shares fell 75 cents to close at 74.125 .
Swedish auto and aerospace concern Saab-Scania AB said it received a 250 million krona 39 million order from Swiss Crossair one of Europe 's leading regional air companies for five Saab 340B turboprop commuter aircraft .
It is quite unfortunate that you failed so miserably in reporting the Hurricane Hugo disaster .
Your Sept. 27 page-one article Charleston Lost Quite a Lot to Hugo Especially Gentility leaves the impression that the storm was little more than an inconvenience .
The damage reported focused on a select few who owned irreplaceable historic homes on the Battery .
Not mentioned were the 50,000 people rendered homeless and the more than 200,000 out of work for an indeterminable period the 1 billion-plus in losses to homes and personal property on the barrier islands the near and long-term impact on the state 's largest industry tourism not to mention the human suffering .
In centering on the disruption of a few proud local customs such as the historic homes tour and the damage to the antiquities your reporter served to only perpetuate an outdated and stereotypically provincial view of this otherwise thriving port city .
The damage will undoubtedly prove to be one of the epic human and economic disasters of the decade in this country .

Your story was tasteless and insensitive .
Depicting the people of a traumatized city reeling from a disaster of unprecedented proportions was at the very best ludicrous under the circumstances .
Your narrow focus appears to be a contrived attempt to show the people of that historic city to be doddering fools .
You had to have been blind not to see the scenario there for what it was and is and will continue to be for months and even years a part of South Carolina that has sustained a blow that the Red Cross expects will cost that organization alone some 38 million .

Affiliated Bankshares of Colorado Inc. said it agreed to sell its 10 % interest in Rocky Mountain Bankcard Systems for 18.5 million to Colorado National Bank of Denver and Central Bank of Denver .
Colorado National is a unit of Colorado National Bankshares Inc. and Central is a unit of First Bank System of Minneapolis .
Affiliated said it expects to record a pretax gain of about 18.5 million from the sale of the credit-card business which should more than offset any reduction in the carrying value of real estate and real-estate loans on its books .
The U.S. Export-Import Bank tentatively decided to guarantee commercial bank financing for the purchase of two Boeing Co. 767 airliners by Avianca Colombia 's international airline at a cost of about 150 million .
The loan guarantee would amount to about 127.5 million or 85 % of the cost of the aircraft .
Because of the size of the proposed loan guarantee the Ex-Im Bank 's preliminary commitment is subject to review by the House and Senate Banking committees .
Ex-Im Bank officials said this review process currently is under way .
Sebastian Guzman Cabrera took over the oil workers union Mexico 's most powerful labor organization only last January .
But even in that short time Mr. Guzman Cabrera has become as controversial in his own way as his deposed predecessor Joaquin Hernandez Galicia known as La Quina .
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari used the army to oust La Quina who reigned for 28 years over a graft-riddled empire that made state-run Petroleos Mexicanos or Pemex one of the world 's most inefficient oil companies .
Now Mr. Guzman Cabrera is facing accusations that he 's as much a company man as La Quina was a crook .
In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union 's role in subcontracting long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings .
And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment .
Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's new order has n't arrived without resistance .
Brawls between union factions still erupt at Pemex installations .
Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas publicly questioned Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's moral quality suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country 's oil a symbol of Mexican nationalism to foreigners .
The 61-year-old Mr. Guzman Cabrera takes such criticisms in stride .
This is n't a new kind of union leadership it 's a new Mexico .
We 're no longer afraid of associating with private or foreign capital he says .
Pemex which produces 40 % of government revenue desperately needs new investment .
Since world oil prices collapsed in 1982 the government has siphoned Pemex 's coffers to make payments on Mexico 's 97 billion foreign debt .
Little money has been returned to upgrade Pemex 's aging facilities .
While the government drains Pemex from above the union has drained it from below .
A bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused Pemex 's operating costs to balloon to 95 cents of each 1 in sales far above the industry norm .
The declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why Mexico has been importing gasoline this year .
Some projections show Mexico importing crude by the end of the century barring an overhaul of operations .
Whatever you tried to change whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners the big obstacle was the old union leadership says oil consultant George Baker .
Enter Mr. Guzman Cabrera who has a clear understanding of where union leaders fit in the pro-enterprise regime of President Salinas .
I 'm the secretary-general if there is one he says greeting a visitor to his office .
Beginning as a laborer in a refinery Mr. Guzman Cabrera put in more than 40 years at Pemex before being pushed into retirement by La Quina after a dispute two years ago .
Though he also long benefited from the system built by La Quina Mr. Guzman Cabrera says union perks had simply gotten out of hand .
They are at the base of all of the problems of corruption he says .
Thus in recent contract negotiations Mr. Guzman Cabrera gave up the union 's right to assign 40 % of all of Pemex 's outside contracts an enormous source of kickbacks .
The union also ceded the 2 % commission it had received on all Pemex maintenance contracts .
The union will keep a 2 % commission on construction projects .
The new contract also eliminates the 15 monthly coupon good only at union-owned grocery stores that was part of the salary of every worker from roughneck to chief executive .
About 9,800 technical workers notably chemists and lawyers were switched to non-union status .
Also because of its reduced capital budget Pemex has phased out about 50,000 transitory construction workers reducing the work force to about 140,000 the union leader says .
Mr. Guzman Cabrera says the union 's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22 % increase in compensation .
But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract .
We are retaking the instruments of administration says Raul Robles a Pemex subdirector .
Pemex officials would n't say how much money the new contract would save the company but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around 500 million a year .
Pemex 's customers also are pleased with the company 's new spirit .
Grupo Desc a big conglomerate has long depended on Pemex petrochemicals to produce plastic packing material .
But when the Pemex plant shut down for an annual overhaul it would never give notice to its customers .
The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations says Ernesto Vega Velasco Desc 's finance director .
This year for the first time Desc and other customers were consulted well in advance of the Pemex plant 's shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience .
Taming the union complements previous moves by the government to attract private investment in petrochemicals which Mexico has been forced to import in large quantities in recent years .
In May the government unveiled new foreign investment regulations that create special trusts allowing foreigners long limited to a 40 % stake in secondary petrochemical companies to own up to 100 % .
Later the government reclassified several basic petrochemicals as secondary products .
But Pemex 's courtship with private companies and especially foreign ones is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938 .
They are preparing the workers for what 's coming foreign control wrote Heberto Castillo a leftist leader .
Mr. Guzman Cabrera and government officials insist that foreigners will be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products .
But the new union leader makes no apologies for Pemex 's more outward-looking attitude .
If we do not integrate into this new world of interdependence sooner or later we 're going to become victims of our own isolation he says .
Couple Counseling Grows to Defuse Stress MORE EXECUTIVES and their spouses are seeking counseling as work and family pressures mount .
Some employers initiate referrals especially if work problems threaten a top manager 's job .
Many couples are like ships passing in the night a communications gulf that sparks problems on the job and at home says psychologist Harry Levinson .
His Levinson Institute in Belmont Mass. has seen in recent years a doubling in the number of executives and spouses at its weeklong counseling program .
Employers foot the bill he says figuring what 's good for the couple is good for the company .
One East Coast manufacturing executive faced with a job transfer his wife resented found that counseling helped them both come to grips with the move .
And the vice president of a large Midwestern company realized that an abrasive temperament threatened his career when his wife confided that similar behavior at home harmed their marriage .
More dual-career couples also are getting help with men increasingly bringing their working wives for joint counseling .
The level of stress for a woman is often so high it 's the husband who says I 'm worried about her says psychologist Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz .
Her Institute for Family and Work Relationships in La Jolla Calif. has noted a doubling in the number of couples seeking help the past two years .
No matter how competent and smart you both are the relationship almost certainly will erode if you do n't have time to talk to have fun and to be sexual says Ms. Shaevitz .
She urges client couples to begin a detoxification period purging social and other nonproductive activities and setting time apart for themselves .
Putting those times on the calendar she says is as important as remembering business appointments .
Power of Suggestion Stronger in Japan HERE 'S ONE more explanation for why Japan is a tough industrial competitor Two of three Japanese employees submit suggestions to save money increase efficiency and boost morale while only 8 % of American workers do .
And the Japanese make far more suggestions 2,472 per 100 eligible employees vs. only 13 per 100 employees in the Data for 1987 from the National Association of Suggestion Systems and the Japan Human Relations Association also indicate that Japanese employers adopt four of five suggestions while their U.S. counterparts accept just one in four .
In Japan small suggestions are encouraged .
Each new employee is expected to submit four daily in the first few months on the job .
U.S. companies tend to favor suggestions that go for the home runs says Gary Floss vice president of corporate quality at Control Data Corp .
That helps explain why American employers grant an average award of 604.72 per suggestion while Japan 's payment is 3.23 .
Still suggestions ' net savings per 100 employees is 274,475 in Japan vs. 24,891 in the U.S. .
U.S. companies developing management teams are wrestling with how to handle individual suggestion systems .
Control Data for one plays down its employee suggestion program because it favors the team-management focus .
Merger Fallout Beware Employee Dishonesty CORPORATE security directors increasingly worry that merger mania spawns a rise in employee dishonesty .
A Security magazine survey places the effect of takeovers and buy-outs among the industry 's 10 biggest challenges .
If it causes management to take their eye off the ball inventory shrinkage is going to be affected says Lewis Shealy vice president for loss prevention at Marshall Field 's the department store chain .
A separate study of the extent of employee misconduct linked general job satisfaction to property loss .
Co-author Richard Hollinger cites what happened at one family-owned company absorbed by a foreign giant .
Pilferage climbed dramatically as many angry employees felt abandoned by the former owners says the University of Florida sociologist .
But top management should watch for other tell-tale signs of employee misdeeds like expense-account fudging and phone misuse .
Security consultant Dennis Dalton of Ventura Calif. thinks mergers often trigger longer lunch hours and increased absenteeism conduct which can sap the bottom line more than thefts .
New management can take several steps to reduce dishonesty .
Most important experts say is to show that a company 's ethical tone is set at the top .
Mr. Dalton also recommends that the chief executive establish a rumor control center and move swiftly to bolster morale .
Consultant John Keller of Southlake Texas urges that top management adopt a tough hands-on approach with very tight controls and monitoring .
And security authority Robert L. Duston favors disciplining all employees who cheat .
Firms Walk Fine Line In Distributing Profits ARE CORPORATE profits distributed fairly .
A survey by Sirota Alper & Pfau a New York consulting firm underscores the difficulty for top management in satisfying employees and investors on that score .
Nearly seven of 10 investors think companies reinvest too little of their profits in the business .
And half the employees surveyed think companies dole out too little to them .
But both see a common enemy About 66 % of employees and 73 % of investors think senior managers get too big a slice of the profit pie .
Bank of New York Co. said it agreed in principle to acquire the credit-card business of Houston-based First City Bancorp. of Texas for between 130 million and 134 million .
The move subject to a definitive agreement is part of a trend by big-city banks that have been buying up credit-card portfolios to expand their business .
Just last month a Bank of New York subsidiary agreed to buy the credit-card operation of Dreyfus Corp. 's Dreyfus Consumer Bank for 168 million a transaction that is expected to be completed by the end of the year .
First City 's portfolio includes approximately 640,000 accounts with about 550 million in loans outstanding .
First City which issues both MasterCard and Visa cards has agreed to act as an agent bank .
At the end of the third quarter Bank of New York 's credit-card business consisted of 2.4 million accounts with 3.6 billion in loans outstanding .
Bank of New York is currently the seventh-largest issuer of credit cards in the First City said that because of increased competition in the credit-card business it had decided it either had to expand its own holdings substantially or sell them .
We think there 's a good prospect that competition is going to get pretty fierce in this market said James E. Day a First City vice president .
We see it becoming a bargain-basement kind of business .
The company estimated that the transaction would enhance its book value which stood at 28.55 a share on Sept. 30 by more than 100 million or about 4 a share .
The company also said the transaction would bolster after-tax earnings by 3.25 a share when completed and boost its primary capital ratio to 7 % from 6.63 % .
First City which recently purchased three small Texas banking concerns said it would use the proceeds to pursue additional expansion opportunities in the Southwest and elsewhere .
With that possibility in mind analysts said the transaction was a positive move for First City .
I think they 'll be able to move faster to make acquisitions in Texas said Brent Erensel an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette .
That 's something they can do very well .
British Airways PLC said it is seeking improved terms and a sharply lower price in any revised bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. following the collapse of a 6.79 billion 300-a-share buy-out bid .
Derek Stevens British Air 's chief financial officer told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report a price of 230 a share is certainly not too low and indicated his company would like to reduce the size of its 750 million cash investment .
He added the airline is n't committed to going forward with any new bid and has n't participated in bankers ' efforts to revive the transaction that collapsed .
We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all .
We 're not rushing into anything .
We do n't want to be party to a second rejection he said adding that coming up with a revised offer could easily take several weeks .
Mr. Stevens 's remarks confirming a report in The Wall Street Journal that British Air wants to start from scratch in any new bid for the nation 's second-largest airline helped push UAL stock lower for the fourth straight day .
UAL fell 6.25 a share to 191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase .
Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 UAL 's pilots planned to put up 200 million in cash and make 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake .
UAL management was to pay 15 million for 10 % and British Air was to receive a 15 % stake .
The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing .
Since then UAL stock has fallen 33 % in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever .
The tenor of Mr. Stevens 's remarks seemed to indicate that British Air will take a more active high-profile role in pursuing any new bid .
He said he believes UAL management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction .
Mr. Stevens said British Air has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group led by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and has n't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming .
As far as we 're concerned we 're waiting for the dust to settle he said .
Although British Air is waiting to see what the buy-out group comes up with Mr. Stevens said a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks .
He said the original proposal is dead and all aspects of a revised version are up for change in light of the changes in UAL 's market price the amount of debt banks are willing to fund and the price British Air would be willing to pay .
Mr. Stevens said he expects the new price will be considerably lower but declined to specify a figure .
Asked whether a 230-a-share figure circulating in the market yesterday is too low he said It 's certainly not too low .
He added the original offer was a pretty full price and that British Air 's contribution was quite a large chunk for us .
British Air was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a 15 % stake in the company but was n't particularly happy with paying 750 million .
If the new deal had us putting up less money but still having 15 % that would be a point in our favor he said .
In any new proposal British Air would expect a greater rate of return than the 20%-plus in the original proposal .
In the event that the buy-out group stalls in reviving its bid the UAL board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction even without any legal obligation to do so .
Roughly one-third of its stock is believed held by takeover stock traders who could vote to oust the board if they become impatient .
Meanwhile the buy-out group 's task of holding its fragile coalition together in the face of the bid 's collapse and internal opposition from two other employee groups has been further complicated by an apparent rift in the ranks of the pilot union itself .
A pilot representing a group of 220 pilots hired during United 's 1985 strike filed suit Friday in Chicago federal court to block the takeover .
The dissident pilots oppose the plan because it would cause them to lose their seniority .
UAL 's management agreed to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the United pilot union for the buy-out proposal .
The 220 pilots involved in the suit are n't members of the union .
The airline had allowed them to move ahead of some union members in seniority following the 1985 strike a move the union had contested in a previous lawsuit .

Corporate efforts to control health-care costs by requiring evaluations prior to planned hospitalization and surgery have n't been sweeping enough to reduce the long-term rate of cost increases according to a study by the Institute of Medicine .
In the last decade many corporations have embraced the utilization management cost containment strategy as a way to control health-care costs for employees .
These programs vary widely but often require second opinions on proposed surgery preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods .
Between 50 % and 75 % of today 's workers are covered by such plans up from 5 % five years ago .
Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers utilization management like most other cost containment strategies does n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs the Institute of Medicine an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences concluded after a two-year study .
Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends .
While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs according to the report by a panel of health-care experts .
The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow .
The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital and not the actual need for a particular procedure has been the main focus the panel said .
As a general rule prior-review programs have not made case-by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care .
The report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines .
