After slipping on news of a smaller-than-expected U.S. inflation figure the dollar rebounded later in the trading day .
The U.S. unit dipped to a session low against the mark just after the release of the U.S. consumer price index .
The report showed that September consumer prices rose just 0.2 % a smaller increase than expected .
The market had anticipated a 0.4 % rise in the price index .
The September index fueled speculation damaging to the dollar that the Federal Reserve soon will ease monetary policy further .
But foreign-exchange dealers said the dollar staged a quick comeback prompted by a round of short covering and some fresh buying interest later in the trading day .
Traders said that a nearly 40-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average fueled in part by news of a lower-than-expected price index had little influence on the dollar 's moves .
The market is beginning to disassociate itself from Wall Street said one New York trader .
In late New York trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 marks down from 1.8485 marks late Wednesday and at 141.70 yen up from 141.45 yen late Wednesday .
Sterling was quoted at 1.5990 up from 1.5920 late Wednesday .
In Tokyo Friday the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.93 yen up from Thursday 's Tokyo close of 141.55 yen .
Some analysts said the consumer price index reflects a more significant slowdown in the U.S. economy than earlier indicated .
They point out that September 's producer-price index showed a 0.9 % increase .
They noted that because the consumer price index known as the CPI is a more comprehensive measure of inflation and is rising less rapidly than the producer-price index or PPI it could signal further easing by Fed .
Others suggested however that the Fed will hold any changes in monetary policy in check leaving fed funds at around 8 3\/4 % down from the 9 % level that prevailed from July through September .
Kevin Logan chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corp. said that both PPI and CPI climbed around 4 1\/2 % year-to-year in September .
He argued that both CPI and PPI have in fact decelerated since spring .
The Fed wo n't be stampeded into easing Mr. Logan said predicting that for now interest rates will stay where they are .

Hotel Investors Trust and its affiliate Hotel Investors Corp. said the companies plan to sell all of the hotels the companies own and operate except for two hotel-casinos in Las Vegas Nev .
The hotels and management interests will be sold at an auction said John Rothman president and chief executive officer of the trust and a director of the corporation .
Value of the properties and management interests was n't disclosed .
In all the Los Angeles-based trust plans to sell its interests in 36 hotels while the corporation will sell its management interests in 32 of those properties .
Excluded from the sale are the interests of the trust and the corporation in two Las Vegas hotel-casinos .
After completing the sale and paying debts the trust and corporation will consider a number of options including a stock repurchase payment of special dividend or investment in more gaming properties .
The companies will retain their current regular quarterly dividend of 25 cents during the sale process Mr. Rothman said .
For the first six months the trust and corporation had a net loss of 244,000 .
Baxter International Inc. citing cost-cutting moves and increased sales of its home-care products and dialysis treatments posted a 20 % rise in third-quarter net income on a 5.9 % sales boost .
The Deerfield Ill. medical products and services company posted net of 102 million or 34 cents a share compared with 85 million or 28 cents a share a year ago .
Sales totaled 1.81 billion up from 1.71 billion the previous year .
For the nine-month period Baxter said net rose 15 % to 307 million or 1.02 a share from 267 million or 89 cents a share during the year-ago period .
Sales for the nine months were up 8 % to 5.44 billion from 5.04 billion in the same period in 1988 .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Baxter closed at 22.25 a share down 12.5 cents .
A group bidding for American Medical International Inc. New York said it formally received the final financing needed for a 3 billion bid for about 86 % of the hospital operator 's stock .
The offer from IMA Acquisition Corp. for as many as 63 million shares is set to expire Wednesday .
Earlier this month IMA said it had received about 1 billion of senior debt financing from Chemical Bank and six other banks Chemical Bank said it was highly confident it could arrange the balance of about 509 million .
In addition the 3 billion bid includes 1 billion of debt that will be assumed by IMA 600 million of high-yield junk bonds that will be sold by First Boston Corp. and 285 million of equity .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday American Medical closed at 23.625 up 1.875 .
American Medical has agreed to the offer but earlier this month said it had received new expressions of interest from two previous bidders .
American Medical said it would pursue the inquiries from the companies but would n't identify them unless they make firm offers .
H&R Block is one of the great success stories of U.S. business .
Oddly enough this presents a problem for the stock .
Some money managers are disenchanted with H&R Block because they suspect the company 's glory days are past or at least passing .
Block 's tax-preparation business is mature they say and some of its diversifications are facing tough competition .
It 's no secret that Block dominates the mass-market tax-preparation business .
The Street knows all about the predictability of its earnings which are headed for a ninth consecutive yearly increase .
The company has consistently earned more than a 20 % annual return on its net worth while many companies would be happy with 15 % .
But the tax-preparation business simply has no more room to grow says Mark Cremonie director of research for Capital Supervisors Inc. a Chicago firm that manages 6.5 billion .
You go to any medium-sized town in the U.S. and you 're going to see H&R Block tax services .
Mr. Cremonie 's firm once held about 4.8 % of H&R Block .
That was before the 1986 tax reform made taxes more complex than ever .
One thing you can bet on he says is that Congress will do stupid things with the Tax Code .
But Capital Supervisors sold the last of its H&R Block holdings earlier this year .
They 're thrashing around for diversification he says .
I think a lot of their businesses are just so-so .
Last week the stock hit an all-time high of 37 1\/4 before getting roughed up in the Friday-the-13th minicrash .
It closed yesterday at 34 3\/4 .
To be sure the stock still has a lot of fans .
If you invested 10,000 in the initial public offering in 1962 it would be worth well over 5 million today says Fredric E. Russell a Tulsa Okla. money manager .
I do n't know what the risk is of holding the stock .
Taxes are not going out of business .
Many of his peers feel the same way .
The number of big institutions that own H&R Block shares is 207 and growing according to a midyear tally by CDA Investment Technologies .
Brokerage houses are sweet on H&R Block too .
Zacks Investment Research counts five brokerage houses that consider the stock a buy and four that call it a hold .
None dare say to sell it .
But some money managers are doing just that .
Eugene Sit president of Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis says When we bought it we thought the growth rate was going to accelerate because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer which waits for Uncle Sam 's check .
But neither of those developments did much to juice up growth Mr. Sit says .
He figures Block earnings are now growing at about a 10 % annual rate down from about 14 % the past five years and will grow at an 8%-10 % rate in the future .
That 's not bad Mr. Sit says but it sure does n't justify Block shares being priced at 15 to 16 times estimated earnings for fiscal 1990 .
He wants stocks whose price\/earnings ratio is less than their growth rate as he figures it H&R Block does n't even come close .
Two other money managers in explaining why they have sold large amounts of H&R Block stock this year spoke on the condition they not be named .
The stock was going no place and the earnings were so-so said one .
In the past two years the stock almost stalled out .
It was above 33 adjusted for a subsequent split in 1987 and has n't gotten much higher since .
There 's no more growth in the tax business except for increasing prices the money manager added .
The CompuServe subsidiary which provides information to home-computer users is where the growth is he said but its format is still too complicated .
CompuServe provides about 20 % of both sales and earnings .
The tax business still provides about 70 % of earnings on about 50 % of sales .
Personnel Pool temporary workers mostly in the health-care area chips in close to 25 % of sales but only about 9 % of earnings .
The shortage of nurses is crimping profit at Personnel Pool said the second money manager .
He concedes H&R Block is well-entrenched and a great company but says it does n't grow fast enough for us .
We 're looking for something that grows faster and sells at a comparable price-earnings multiple .
Thomas M. Bloch president and chief operating officer says I would disagree that the tax business is mature .
For example he says the company is planning to go nationwide with a new service tested in parts of the country aimed at taxpayers who want refunds in a hurry .
Mr. Bloch concedes that a recent diversification attempt fell through .
We 're still interested in diversifying he says but we 'd rather be prudent than make a mistake .
He also says CompuServe 's earnings continue to grow 20 % to 30 % a year in spite of tough competition from giants like Sears and IBM .
And he says Block 's other businesses are growing although less consistently .

The Dayton Ohio maker of parts for the building and transportation industries said holders of the two issues can convert their stock into common shares through the close of business Dec. 1 .
Each 1 cumulative share can be converted into 4.92 common shares the ratio on the 3 cumulative is eight common shares for each 3 cumulative preferred .
Philips did n't indicate how many shares outstanding it has of either issue .
Company officials could n't be reached .
Earlier this month the company said its board approved a proposed management-led leveraged buy-out at 25.50 a share or 750 million .

PUTS AND CALLS STOCK MARKET PATOIS for options to sell or buy a company 's shares were long an arcane Wall Street art best left to the experts who used them either as a hedge or for pure speculation .
Options lost some of their mystery in 1973 when the Chicago Board of Trade set up a special exchange to deal in them .
Until then options had been traded only in the over-the-counter market mostly in New York and in an almost invisible secondary market operating chiefly by telephone .
The Chicago Board of Trade the No. 1 U.S. grain market had long chafed under the attention won by its innovative archrival the livestock-dealing Mercantile Exchange .
So the men who ran the grain pits listened when Joseph Sullivan a 35-year-old former Wall Street Journal newsman offered them the idea of all-options trading .
After four year of tinkering and 2.4 million in seed money the board set up the new marketplace titled it the Chicago Board Options Exchange and named Sullivan its first president .
The beginnings were modest .
The CBOE opened for business on April 26 1973 in what had been a Board of Trade lunchroom .
It listed just 16 options to buy a pilot list of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange .
Puts or sell options would not be added until 1977 .
The 282 members had paid 10,000 apiece for seats .
The 1989 price 250,000 .
The first day 's business was 911 contracts each for 100 shares of one of the listed stocks .
By the end of 1973 the number of underlying Big Board stocks had been increased to 50 and the options exchange had run up volume of 1.1 million contracts .
A year later it was 5.7 million .
Last year more than 1,800 traders on the CBOE bought and sold 112 million contracts on 178 listed stocks 60 % of all U.S. listed options trading .
The new exchange drew instant recognition from an unwelcome quarter .
The government campaigning against fixed brokerage commissions promptly sued the CBOE over its minimum-fee system .
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled unanimously that the financial troubles facing the Seabrook N.H. nuclear-power plant have no impact on whether the plant receives a full-power license .
Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon opposing the license said he will appeal the ruling in federal court .
Seabrook officials said the plant could receive a full-power license by the end of the year .
The NRC rejected Mr. Shannon 's argument that Public Service Co. of New Hampshire which owns the largest share of Seabrook and 11 other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plant 's safe operation .
Mr. Shannon was seeking a waiver of NRC policy that ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions .
In its ruling the NRC said that because Seabrook will be allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make payments on past construction costs consideration of the owners ' financial condition is pointless .
The commissioners found the circumstances of the case did n't undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available funds adequate for safe operation said a commission spokesman .
In January 1988 the utility filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code allowing it to continue to operate while protected from creditors ' lawsuits .
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. New York the newly merged drug and health-care-product company reported record third-quarter earnings for both companies in the merger .
Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp. Princeton N.J. merged Oct. 4 but the new company reported third-period earnings for both companies .
For the fourth quarter Bristol-Myers Squibb will report one set of earnings .
Bristol-Myers said net income rose 15 % to 266.2 million or 93 cents a share from 232.3 million or 81 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales gained 5 % to 1.59 billion from 1.52 billion .
Squibb Corp. said net rose 17 % to 144.5 million or 1.47 a share from 123 million or 1.25 a share .
Sales were 730.1 million up 7 % from 679.5 million .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 1.75 to 52.75 .
PPG Industries Inc. hurt by softness in the U.S. automotive and construction industries said third-quarter net income fell 5.5 % to 106.7 million or 97 cents a share from 112.9 million or 1.03 a share a year ago .
Sales were nearly identical to the year-earlier 1.36 billion .
The drop in earnings did n't surprise analysts who said the Pittsburgh glass coatings and chemical concern had been predicting a slow quarter because of the sluggish construction industry a major market for the company 's flat glass .
Glass sales to Canadian and European auto makers and sales of replacement auto glass in all markets increased .
The coating segment also posted higher sales particularly in North America and Europe .
But sale increases were offset by slumping sales in flat glass and fiberglass reinforcements the company said .
Also chemicals sales were slightly down because of lower prices for vinyl chloride monomer and other chlorine derivatives .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading PPG closed at 41 a share down 37.5 cents .
Jefferies Group Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 4 % to 2.2 million or 35 cents a share from 2.3 million or 31 cents a share on more shares a year earlier .
Revenue rose 15 % to 36 million from 31.2 million .
Jefferies a Los Angeles holding company primarily engaged in securities trading also said stock market declines since the quarter ended Sept. 30 created an unrealized pretax loss of about 6 million in its risk arbitrage account .
For the nine months Jefferies said net fell 39 % to 6.8 million or 1.07 a share from 11.1 million or 1.50 a share .
Revenue fell 3 % to 105.2 million from 108.4 million .
Sony Corp. New York said its bids for Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. have been cleared by federal antitrust regulators .
The Japanese company said the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act for the 3.4 billion bid for Columbia and the 200 million offer for Guber-Peters expired Monday .
Sony has agreed to buy both companies but is in a legal battle with Warner Communications Inc. over the services of producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters .
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Sony also said two more suits have been filed opposing the company 's agreement to buy Columbia .
Sony added that a hearing has been set for Thursday in the Delaware Chancery Court in one of the suits .

China said the question of Taiwan 's membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be considered only after China 's own membership in the 97-nation organization is restored .
Both China and Taiwan are seeking seats in GATT which sponsors trade-liberalizing agreements and sets world-commerce rules .
As one of China 's provinces Taiwan has no right to join GATT on its own Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said .
China under the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek was a founding member of GATT in 1947 .
The Nationalists withdrew in 1950 after their flight to Taiwan and the Communist government in Beijing applied for restoration of China 's membership in July 1986 .
The U.S. has voiced opposition to China 's bid for GATT membership saying China has yet to undertake needed economic reforms .

An appeals-court panel slashed all but 40,000 from the award the largest ever set by a British jury pending a reassessment of the damages .
But the panel dismissed the magazine 's contention that it had n't libeled Mrs. Sutcliffe when it accused her of trying to sell her story to capitalize on the notoriety of her husband .

Mr. Dang is alleged to have used the account of Singapore hotel and property magnate Ong Beng Seng to effect the transactions .
Japan says its economic growth will fall sharply if it cuts back on the use of oil coal and gas to cap emissions of carbon dioxide .
A Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said that a study found that Japan 's annual economic growth rate would eventually be only 0.8 % if carbon-dioxide emissions remained at this year 's level of 300 million tons .
The study will support arguments against capping carbon-dioxide emissions that Japan will make at a U.N.-backed conference on atmospheric pollution next month .
The study said Japan 's carbon-dioxide emissions would slightly more than double by 2010 unless the nation reduced its dependence on fossil fuels .
It said that expanding nuclear-power capability is the quickest way to lessen that dependence .
But increased reliance on nuclear power would meet stiff opposition from environmentalists a second ministry official said .

About 5,500 hourly workers will be laid off for a week beginning Oct. 23 and overtime has been eliminated at the plant for the fourth quarter a Chrysler spokesman said .
That 's a significant change from earlier this year when the plant worked substantial overtime only to have sales fall short of the company 's bullish expectations .
Sales of Cherokee the best-selling Jeep and the lower-volume Wagoneer were actually up about 10 % through the end of last month .
But that 's less than Chrysler officials had hoped when they set ambitious production schedules for the Toledo plant earlier this year .
Even when it became clear this spring that demand was n't coming up to expectations Chrysler officials resisted cutting output because Cherokee and Wagoneer are very profitable vehicles the spokesman said .
Instead Chrysler officials in late May slapped 1,000 cash rebates on the vehicles including the first such incentives on the popular four-door Cherokee since Chrysler bought Jeep in 1987 .
The incentives boosted sales for a while but the pace had cooled by last month .
The result Chrysler dealers had a bloated 82-day supply of the Cherokee as of the end of last month and a 161-day supply of the Comanche pickup which Toledo also builds .
A 60-day to 65-day supply is considered normal .
At Jasper Jeep-Eagle one of the largest Jeep dealerships in the country inventories have continued to swell .
Steve Lowe general manager of Jasper Ga. dealership said new rebates of 500 to 1,000 on the models have stimulated sales but not enough to significantly cut dealer stocks .
If people are n't buying you have to close plants he said .
Separately Chrysler said it will idle for four weeks the St. Louis assembly plant that builds the Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models .
Chrysler officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on Nov. 20. and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected .
General Motors Corp. meanwhile said it will idle for yet
