 referred to as poker chips .
Finally even the time-honored strategy called value investing no longer means what it once did .
Before the takeover mania of the '80s it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks especially those with shrewd management sound fundamentals and decent prospects .
Now says Mr. Biehl value investing often means looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble .
To institutional investors or brokers he adds a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up .

I was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries .
If the whole story were told it would read something like this During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and Use of Proceeds confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made .
The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings and management bonuses the price a sea of bad loans .
For the past several years the banks lacking a private navy to enforce their interests have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury to underwrite their bad LDC credits .
The Treasury wisely has refused but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans the Brady Plan .
The banks will threaten not to make further loans but in truth lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy they have no alternative but to go along .
George A. Wiegers Gillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to its board increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11 .
Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought 600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11 % stake and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board .
Separately Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2 % to 65.2 million or 57 cents a share from 63.9 million or 57 cents a share in the year-earlier period per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a 10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period .
Sales rose 9 % to 921.6 million from 845.7 million with sales of the company 's international\/diversified operations well above the year earlier-period .
For the nine months Gillette 's net income declined 1 % to 205.3 million or 2.02 a share from 207 million or 1.82 a share in the 1988 period .
Sales rose 6 % to 2.77 billion from 2.61 billion .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange the company closed yesterday at 45.50 a share up 25 cents .
When Walter Yetnikoff the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a 3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio Mr. Guber jumped at the chance .
Within two days he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony .
And before the week was out Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner Jon Peters the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business .
Not only that Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia 's future profits and buy their company Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for 200 million almost 40 % more than the market value of the company .
There was just one sticking point The two had a prior commitment .
Just seven months earlier they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for Warner Bros. for which they had just produced the smash hit Batman .
But Mr. Guber figured that Warner Communications Inc. chairman Steven Ross would empathize and let the producers go knowing the Sony offer was the culmination of a life 's work .
He figured wrong .
Last week following fruitless settlement talks Warner now merging with Time Inc. filed a 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters .
Sony promptly countersued charging Warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the U.S. movie business .
The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides As one Sony executive puts it It 's World War III .
That two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside Hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business .
And they are a very odd team in any case .
Mr. Guber was raised in Boston and educated in New York .
He is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees .
Mr. Peters is a high-school dropout who came to fame as Barbra Streisand 's hairdresser .
Yet they are far and away the most prolific producers in Hollywood .
And despite their share of duds they make movies that make money .
That is a skill Sony badly needs and Warner is loath to lose .
Although Columbia had a good summer with Ghostbusters II and When Harry Met Sally rivals such as Warner Paramount Pictures Walt Disney Co. and Universal Studios have been thrashing Columbia at the box office .
After five years of management turmoil with four different studio heads Columbia sorely needs a stable savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters are n't universally loved in Hollywood but they are well connected .
Their stock in trade as executive producers is sniffing out hot properties locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them .
Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a Flashdance or buy rights to a best seller such as The Color Purple .
It falls to others to do the writing directing and producing .
With MGM\/UA 's Rainman for instance Messrs. Guber and Peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production but their names still appear in big letters on the credits and they are inevitably associated with its success .
Sometimes as with Batman the pair really do make the film .
In that case Guber Peters acquired the rights in 1979 nursed the movie through a dozen scripts and were on the set in London for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production .
They 're the best production talent around says Brian De Palma beholden to Guber Peters for hiring him to direct the Warner movie of Tom Wolfe 's novel Bonfire of the Vanities .
On that film which is to start shooting in a few months they 've been very much involved hiring talent and discussing the development of the script .
And when you 're making a movie this big you need all the help you can get Mr. De Palma adds .
I wish they were around 24 hours a day .
And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention .
Warner executives blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in Caddyshack II for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure .
We 've had a few bombs admits Mr. Peters .
But by and large this company has only been profitable .
He says his company 's prowess at packaging and marketing is why we 'll be good at Columbia .
We practically ran our own studio .
Longtime Hollywood associates describe Mr. Guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing .
Peter is a major piece of Hollywood manpower who has really earned his success says Robert Bookman an agent at Creative Artists Agency .
Mark Johnson the producer of Rainman chimes in He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority .
It 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material .
Mr. Peters on the other hand has fewer fans in Hollywood and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully .
He gets better reviews as a creative whiz an enthusiast an idea man .
He also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did .
Barbra Streisand made him famous .
He cut her hair .
He lived with her .
He came to produce her records and her movies A Star Is Born and The Main Event .
Thrice married but now single Mr. Peters got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress Kim Basinger during the making of Batman .
Mr. Guber by contrast has been married to one woman for more than 20 years .
But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences they make the perfect good cop bad cop team Hollywood associates say .
Peter is the bright sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal says one agent .
If there 's a problem Peter disappears and all of a sudden Jon shows up .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way .
Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer who shepherded Flashdance through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie bristle when Messrs. Guber and Peters take credit for the film .
Says Mr. Simpson The script was unreadable .
We reinvented it .
We are the producers of that movie .
They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit as executive producers .
When Roger Birnbaum an executive who worked for Guber Peters in the early 1980s left to take a job as head of production at the United Artists studio they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop including Rainman and Batman .
Mr. Peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner .
I was upset with Roger I fumpered and schmumpered says Mr. Peters .
But he wanted to pursue his own dream and he went .
Still Mr. Birnbaum says his relationship with Guber Peters was one of the most successful I 've had in Hollywood .
The two have a wonderful chemistry Jon is very impulsive and Peter is very compulsive adds Mr. Birnbaum who is now head of production at News Corp. 's 20th Century Fox Film Co .
Jon Peters will come barreling into a room say he 's got a great idea and be gone .
Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific .
Mr. Birnbaum recalls that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey which became Gorillas in the Mist .
He says Within a few weeks we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey .
I think Peter even made some deals with the gorillas .
Universal Studios was working on a competing film but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with Guber Peters and Warner .
More recently Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest .
Messrs. Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man 's widow for months showing her a tape of Gorillas in the Mist to impress her with the quality of their work .
Money helped too .
Ultimately they paid more than 1 million for the rights .
The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband 's followers .
Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest .
It 's hardly astonishing given the men 's track record that Sony wants Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters .
But it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first .
Some note that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract .
But though people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters it 's good to have a partner and obviously the chemistry works says Steven Tisch a producer who once worked for Mr. Guber .
This business is n't about personalities at the end of the day it s about whether the ink is red or black .
In the case of Peter and Jon the ink has been very very black .
Mr. Guber got his start in the movie business at Columbia two decades ago .
Recruited from New York University 's MBA program he rose within two years to head of production overseeing such films as The Way We Were Taxi Driver Tommy and Shampoo .
In 1976 he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks later called Polygram Pictures where they produced such hits as as The Deep and Midnight Express .
In 1980 Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters by then a successful producer in his own right after the death of Mr. Bogart .
While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others their record was n't always so impressive .
Among their clinkers were The Legend of Billie Jean VisionQuest Clue and Clan of the Cave Bear .
And the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates .
The studio says it stuck with them even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner .
Mr. Guber replies that this is a Goliath this Time Warner trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters maintain that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse but that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony .
From the beginning they knew we had a goal and a dream says Mr. Guber .
On a number of occasions he adds he tried to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright .
They always listened but they never acted Mr. Guber says .
In 1987 Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a 28 % stake in Barris Entertainment a small-fry TV production company controlled by Giant Industries Inc. Chairman Burt Sugarman .
In July a year later Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs. Guber Peters and Sugarman made a 100 million offer to buy 25 % of MGM\/UA .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters planned to run the nearly dormant MGM studio and the two even tried to interest Warner Bros .
President Terry Semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal .
But the MGM plan collapsed just two weeks later .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price .
Their relationship with Mr. Sugarman soured shortly thereafter .
Last May he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co .
Meanwhile Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract .
The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind both financially and in terms of creative freedom .
But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month the chance at last to run a major studio about 50 million in deferred compensation up to 10 % of Columbia 's future cash flow 8 % of the future appreciation of Columbia 's market value and annual salaries of 2.7 million for each .
The producers ' 28 % share of publicly held Guber Peters would net them an additional 50 million .
Sony also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to Warner .
Sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only 42 million last year .
And earnings have been erratic .
In the the latest quarter thanks in part to Batman Guber Peters earned 5.8 million or 50 cents a share compared to a loss of 6.8 million or 62 cents a share in last year 's quarter .
Guber Peters stock which traded as low as 6 a share last year closed yesterday at 16.625 .
The two sides now are accusing each other of lying .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise .
But in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court Mr. Ross Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made .
Warner in its court filings calls it a piece of fiction created for this litigation .
Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different .
For one thing according to Mr. Daly the producers requested a release in advance .
Moreover the old contract was about to expire and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now .
Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights and it was in Warner 's interest to accommodate MGM\/UA Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives Mr. Daly said in his affidavit .
Warner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia .
At the very least Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony .
During settlement talks for example Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner according to executives involved in the talks .
In any settlement Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years notably sequels to Batman .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner .
And they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts .
The last time Columbia Pictures was looking for a studio chief they note Warner released producer David Puttnam from his contract then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at Columbia .
In his affidavit filed yesterday Warner 's Mr. Ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument If Sony succeeds here no written contract in Hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on .
THE SALES PITCH could n't sound better .
First there 's the name asset-backed securities .
Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing .
And there 's more .
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest and most secure institutions .
Most earn high ratings from credit agencies .
Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues .
And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors .
Ready to jump .
Well think twice .
The concept may be simple Take a bunch of loans tie them up in one neat package and sell pieces of the package to investors .
But the simplicity may be misleading .
Skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk .
They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them and those are hard to evaluate .
Moreover the securities were introduced only about 4 1\/2 years ago the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession .
A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters says Owen Carney director of the investment securities division of the U.S. comptroller of the currency .
We do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn .
Such concerns however have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products .
Since the spring of 1985 financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities .
They have sold issues backed by car loans boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans .
They have offered bundles of homeequity loans as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares .
Last year there was an issue of death-backed bonds securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders .
Some predict there will be Third World bonds backed by loans to Brazil Argentina and other debt-ridden nations .
And the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables sometimes known as plastic bonds .
This is the heyday of debt says James Grant editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer a newsletter .
Before the sun sets on the '80s it seems nothing will be left unhocked .
The result is a 45 billion market according to Securities Data Co .
That includes more than 9.5 billion issued through August of this year up sharply from 6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period and more than in all of 1987 .
Most issues have been sold to professional money managers pension funds bank trust departments and other institutions .
But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market .
The entry fee is affordable Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of 1,000 .
We expect additional offerings of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors says Bill Addiss a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
The process typically begins when an institution such as Citibank or Sears Roebuck & Co. takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust .
The trust then issues securities generally due in five years or less that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors .
Issues typically come with credit enhancements such as a bank letter of credit and thus have received high credit ratings .
Enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions .
Asset-backed securities are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds says Craig J. Goldberg managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
But skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks .
Consider a 500 million offering of 9 % securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables .
The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues .
On a 10,000 investment that 's a difference of only 50 a year .
That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street .
But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have that margin is meaningless .
If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby then even an extra 25 basis points 0.25 percentage point becomes an important consideration on a career basis says Mr. Grant .
But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again then that is n't of overwhelming importance .
Moreover the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level .
That 's why some investment managers such as Alex Powers a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states such as New York or California .
But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts such as retirement plans .
He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts .
Another concern is liquidity or how easily a security can be converted into cash .
The secondary or resale market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues .
That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature .
That 's particularly true analysts say for certain of the securities such as those backed by time-share loans .
You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market says Jonathan S. Paris a vice president of European Investors Inc. a New York investment-management firm .
In addition an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange can simply check newspaper listings .
There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities .
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem .
Investors for instance may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities .
It is n't .
The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks Citibank N.A. Citicorp or any affiliate thereof .
In other words if there 's a problem do n't expect Citibank to come to the rescue .
The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency .
That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received .
That also is n't easy .
Take the credit enhancements which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company .
The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities .
Nor does it cover the entire portfolio .
Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue .
Still they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim .
But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper .
When you buy an asset-backed issue you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties .
If a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of say its loans to Third World nations that could also affect the ratings liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports .
Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions .
But despite the credit enhancements despite the high ratings some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets .
At a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times .
At the very least a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find that is Treasurys .
That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities as well as make it tougher to unload the latter .
But it could be much worse .
Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues .
For one thing credit-card loans are unsecured .
In addition they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession .
A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds says Craig Corcoran of Davis\/Zweig Futures Inc. an investment advisory firm .
What about triple-A-rated asset-backed issues .
Nope we still say to stick with Treasurys Mr. Corcoran replies .
Ratings he notes are subject to change .
All this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people .
And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. of what he calls DeVoe 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1 More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations scams and frauds of all time .

IF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence it would probably be a one-word sentence Diversify .
Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc. serious investors have taken that advice to heart .
Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal 's poll providing an in-depth look at their portfolios .
Those portfolios are remarkably diversified .
By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area be it stocks bonds or real estate .
For example about 88 % of Journal readers owned stock down slightly from 91 % in a similar poll last year .
But only 17.5 % said they had more than half their money in the stock market .
Similarly 57 % of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund and 33 % own municipal bonds .
But only 6 % to 7 % of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives .
The poll conducted Aug. 7-28 also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics .
It found them in a cautious but not downbeat mood .
Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire 951 replied .
The response rate more than 63 % allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence .
The results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors though .
Journal readers are relatively affluent with a median household income of between 75,000 and 99,000 .
Nearly half of the respondents 47 % said their investment portfolio was worth 250,000 or more and 17 % said it was worth 1 million or more .
The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago .
For example 12 % of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months .
Last year only 8 % were expecting a recession .
An additional 56 % of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months .
Only 42 % of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth .
Apparently the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much .
A slim majority 51 % think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989 .
Their verdict on real estate is almost the same .
Some 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months .
By contrast only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold .
Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control .
Even though only 12 % actually predicted a recession many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance .
Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession .
For the most part the changes were slight .
The two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who do n't believe in trying to predict the markets about 31 % and investors who do n't expect a recession about 15 % or are unsure if and when a recession might come about 22 % .
A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents .
Most own two to 10 stocks and buy or sell no more than three times a year .
Some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year only 57 % had sold any .
But the lurking shadow of 1987 's stock-market crash still seems dark .
About 33 % considered another crash likely while about 63 % said one is unlikely .
Those percentages hardly changed from the previous year 's poll .
And the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual .
About 60 % of them said they would ordinarily have at least 25 % of their money in stocks .
But as of August only 50 % actually had stock-market investments of that size .
Most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll .
But it appears that many Journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon .

Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage .
That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage .
Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies said Noel D. Matchett a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc. Silver Spring Md .
It may well be that theft of business data is as serious a strategic threat to national security as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms said Michelle Van Cleave the White House 's assistant director for National Security Affairs .
The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association a joint industry-government trade group .
Any secret can be pirated the experts said if it is transmitted over the air .
Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder .
They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait .
You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time Mr. Matchett said adding It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught .
The only way to catch an electronic thief he said is to set him up with erroneous information .
Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year most are n't yet taking precautions the experts said .
By contrast European firms will spend 150 million this year on electronic security and are expected to spend 1 billion by 1992 .
Already many foreign firms especially banks have their own cryptographers conference speakers reported .
Still encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy .
One expert whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers for example doubling as foreign spies .
Moreover he said technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been erased from a computer 's memory .
He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read .
No personal computer not even the one on a chief executive 's desk is safe this speaker noted .
W. Mark Goode president of Micronyx Inc. a Richardson Texas firm that makes computer-security products provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev 's campaign for greater openness known commonly as glasnost .
Under Mr. Gorbachev Mr. Goode said the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications .
He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East .
Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company which had n't been invited to submit a bid .
The Soviets ' eavesdropping paid off however because they got the contract .
The University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp .
The University said the two companies agreed to spend 25 million Canadian dollars 21.3 million over 10 years on research at Canadian universities if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine maker .
It said 10 million would go to the University of Toronto .
Ciba-Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of 866 million for Connaught and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of 942 million .
The University is seeking an injunction against the Merieux bid arguing that Connaught 's predecessor company agreed in 1972 that Connaught 's ownership would n't be transferred to foreigners .
The university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if Ciba-Geigy and Chiron are successful with their lower bid .
It said the new agreement would replace the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover .
Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught this accord would enhance research and development in Canada said James Keffer the university 's vice president of research .
Ciba-Geigy is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and Chiron is based in Emeryville Calif .
In a statement Jacques-Francois Martin director general of Merieux said the French company is still determined to acquire Connaught .
While he did n't comment directly on the pact between Ciba-Geigy and the university he said Merieux can transfer new products and technologies to Connaught more rapidly than other companies not currently producing and marketing vaccines who can only promise this for some years in the future .

Row 21 of Section 9 of the Upper Reserved at Candlestick Park is a lofty perch only a few steps from the very top of the stands .
From my orange seat I looked over the first-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the World Series .
It was five in the afternoon but that was Pacific time .
Back in New York the work day was already over so I did n't have to feel guilty .
Even still I did feel self-indulgent and I could n't help remembering my father 's contempt for a rich medical colleague who would go to watch the Tigers on summer afternoons .
This ballpark the Stick was not a classic baseball stadium too symmetrical too much bald concrete .
And it did n't have the crowded wild intimacy of Yankee Stadium .
But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me liked it that they 'd brought their children found it charming that true citizens of the state of the future they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event .
Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history .
The broadcasters were after all documenting the game ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick .
Why not watch or hear your experience historicized while you were living it .
The day was saturated with the weight of its own impending history .
Long lines of people waited to buy special souvenir World Series postcards with official postmarks .
Thousands of us had paid 5 for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on Series trivia its historical photographs of great moments in Series past and its instructions in English and Spanish for filling in the scorecard .
Pitcher = lanzador .
Homerun = jonron .
Players ran out on the field way below and the stands began to reverberate .
It must be a local custom I thought stamping feet to welcome the team .
But then the noise turned into a roar .
And no one was shouting .
No one around me was saying anything .
Because we all were busy riding a wave .
Sixty thousand surfers atop a concrete wall waiting for the wipeout .
Only at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what was going on .
Then I remembered the quake of '71 which I experienced in Santa Barbara in a second-story motel room .
When the swaying of the building woke me up I reasoned that a I was in Southern California b the bed was moving c it must be a Magic Fingers bed that had short-circuited .
Then I noticed the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what had happened .
What should I do .
Get out of the possibly collapsing building to the parking lot .
But the lot might split into crevasses so I had better stand on my car which probably was wider than the average crevasse .
Fortunately the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood .
At the Stick while the world shook I thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different .
If I survived I would have achieved every journalist 's highest wish .
I was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment .
What was my angle .
How would I file .
All these thoughts raced through my head in the 15 seconds of the earthquake 's actual duration .
The rest is of course history .
The Stick did n't fall .
The real tragedies occurred elsewhere as we soon found out .
But for a few minutes there relief abounded .
A young mother found her boy who had been out buying a hotdog .
The wall behind me was slightly deformed but the center had held .
And most of us waited for a while for the game to start .
Then we began to file out to wait safely on terra firma for the opening pitch .
It was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the Stick that I really understood the point of all those Walkmen and Watchmen .
The crowd moved in clumps clumps magnetized around an electronic nucleus .
In this way while the Stick itself was blacked out we kept up to date on events .
Within 15 minutes of the quake itself I was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the Bay Bridge .
Increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before I got to my car .
And by then expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the gridlocked parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black plume of smoke we saw on the northern horizon .
Darkness fell .
But the broadcasts continued through the blacked-out night with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in Oakland and firefighting in the Marina district .
By then our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of listeners and viewers .
Everyone at the Stick that day had started out as a spectator and ended up as a participant .
In fact the entire population of the Bay Area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience .
The reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters .
The outstanding example of this was the motorist on the Bay Bridge who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway .
The tape was on tv before the night was out .
Marshall McLuhan you should have been there at that hour .
Investors who received Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions .
The first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank except for the page numbers .
Rather than printing devils Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market .
The plunge made Shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date .
In fact last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week .
Shearson a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co. did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so We decided to kill our strategy pieces says Jack Rivkin the head of Shearson 's research department .
The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary and that 's why it purged its pages .
Investors recalled that Shearson last week had been a
