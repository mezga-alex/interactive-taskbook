another week its Linden N.J. assembly plant bringing to three weeks the total time that plant will be idled during October .
GM said the assembly plant which builds the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30 .
The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars .
Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM to offer 800 rebates on those cars .
The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet but sales of the cars are off 9.6 % for the year and fell a steep 34.2 % early this month .
GM has scheduled overtime at its Lordstown Ohio and Janesville Wis. assembly plants which build the Chevrolet Cavalier .
Ford Motor Co. said it will shut down for one week its Kentucky Truck Plant because of a shortage of dealer orders .
The shutdown will idle 2,000 hourly employees and eliminate production of about 1,300 medium and heavy duty trucks .
The assembly plant is scheduled to resume production on Oct. 30 .
Meanwhile the nine major U.S. auto makers plan to build 143,178 cars this week down 11.7 % from 162,190 a year ago and flat with last week 's 142,117 car output .

LOTUS DEVELOPMENT Corp. 's net income rose 61 % in the third quarter from the year-earlier period .
Yesterday 's edition misstated the percentage increase .
First Fidelity Bancorp. Lawrenceville N.J. reported a 24 % drop in third-quarter profit because of a decline in earning assets lower loan volume and tighter interest margins .
The bank holding company posted net income of 54.4 million or 87 cents a share including 1.7 million or three cents a share in one-time tax benefits .
A year earlier net was 71.6 million or 1.22 a share .
First Fidelity said non-performing assets increased to 482.3 million Sept. 30 from 393.1 million June 30 .
The rise resulted from the transfer to non-accrual status of 96 million owed by two national borrowers and one local commercial real-estate customer First Fidelity said .
It said it does n't anticipate any loss of principal on two of the loans comprising 85 million of these credits .
First Fidelity said it boosted its loan-loss provision to 50.9 million from 20.4 million a year ago primarily because of a weaker real-estate sector in the region .
VIACOM Inc. 's loss narrowed to 21.7 million in the third quarter from 56.9 million a year ago .
Thursday 's edition misstated the narrowing .
Coastal Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement with Aruba to restart a 150,000-barrel-a-day oil refinery .
Coastal would n't disclose the terms .
Coastal a Houston oil and gas company said it expects to begin operations in October 1990 .
The company said it may install additional processing units at the refinery to produce higher octane gasolines and other products .
The company said it was leasing the site of the refinery from Aruba .
Exxon Corp. built the plant but closed it in 1985 and sold off much of the equipment to dismantling contractors from whom Coastal bought back much of the equipment .
A Coastal spokesman said the biggest expense will be to refurbish the refinery but would n't say how much that would be .
The prime minister of Aruba has said it could cost around 100 million .
Coastal said the refinery 's expected daily production will include 34,000 barrels of jet fuel 32,000 barrels of low-sulfur diesel fuel 30,000 barrels of naphtha 17,000 barrels of residual fuel oil 8,000 barrels of asphalt and 25,000 barrels of low-sulfur catalytic cracker feedstock .
Loral Corp. said fiscal second-quarter net income was 19.8 million or 79 cents a share compared with year-earlier earnings from continuing operations of 15.6 million or 62 cents a share .
Year-earlier net of 21 million or 84 cents a share included the results of Loral 's former Aircraft Braking Systems and Engineered Fabrics divisions which were sold April 27 to the company 's chairman Bernard L. Schwartz .
The defense electronics concern attributed the operating improvement to higher profit margins and lower net interest expense .
Loral also reported that its bookings more than doubled to 654 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from 257 million in the year-before period .
The increase was due mainly to a 325 million order from Turkey to equip its fleet of F-16 fighters with Loral 's ALQ-178 Rapport III electronic countermeasures system .
The order is the biggest in the company 's history .
Sales in the latest period edged up to 295.7 million from 293.9 million .
Mr. Schwartz said the recent increase in orders puts us well on the way to our goal of 1.6 billion in bookings for the year .
He added I expect to see the earnings momentum we experienced this quarter continue for the rest of the year .
Loral said it expects sales to accelerate in both the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year .
Loral 's profit from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal 1990 was 36.4 million or 1.44 a share up 31 % from 27.8 million or 1.11 a share a year earlier .
Net income fell 8.6 % to 37.1 million or 1.43 a share from 40.6 million or 1.56 a share .
Fiscal first-half sales slipped 3.9 % to 528.4 million from 549.9 million .
Bookings for the first half totaled 813 million compared with the 432 million recorded last year .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Loral closed at 33.25 down 37.5 cents .
HealthVest said two of its lenders have given it notices of default on bank loans and said they may take actions to recover their loans .
HealthVest an Austin Texas real estate investment trust said that Chemical Bank the lead bank under its domestic bank agreement told it that if 3.3 million owed to the bank group is n't paid by today the group will call the 120 million that HealthVest has outstanding under the credit line .
The bank group also said that it wo n't make additional advances under the 150 million credit line .
HealthVest missed a payment to the group that was due in late September .
In addition HealthVest said Bank of Tokyo Trust Co. also has notified it of a default and said it might take action to cure the default .
HealthVest missed an interest payment to Bank of Tokyo on Oct. 1 .
However HealthVest said the Tokyo bank indicated that it wo n't accelerate HealthVest 's 50 million loan .
HealthVest is in a severe liquidity bind because its affiliate Healthcare International Inc. has failed to make about 10.6 million in principal and interest payments owed since August .
Healthcare operates many of the health-care properties that HealthVest owns .
EMPIRE PENCIL later called Empire-Berol developed the plastic pencil in 1973 .
Yesterday 's Centennial Journal misstated the company 's name .
Storage Technology Corp. had net income of 8.3 million or 32 cents a share for its fiscal-third quarter ended Sept. 29 almost 15 times the 557,000 or two cents a share it posted for the year-ago period .
Storage Louisville Colo. which makes data-storage devices for mainframe computers said the huge increase in net reflects strong sales of its tape products particularly the 4400 Automated Cartridge System which holds a library of tape cartridges .
The company said it recently sold its 750th cartridge system which cost 400,000 to 500,000 each .
Quarter revenue was 232.6 million up 12 % from 206 million last year .
The stock market reacted strongly to the news .
Storage rose 1.125 a share to close at 14 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
For the nine months Storage had net of 25.5 million or 98 cents a share including an 11.3 million extraordinary gain for the anticipated proceeds from liquidating an Irish unit .
Net was up 69 % from 15.1 million or 57 cents a share last year .
Revenue for the latest period was up 11 % to 682.7 million from 614.6 million .
A Canadian government agency conditionally approved proposed exports to the U.S. of natural gas from big untapped fields in the Mackenzie River delta area of the western Canadian Arctic .
Three companies Esso Resources Canada Ltd. Shell Canada Ltd. and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. applied to the Canadian National Energy Board to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta natural gas over 20 years starting in 1996 .
To be economically feasible the 11 billion Canadian dollar 9.37 billion project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices .
It also faces numerous other hurdles including an agreement on a pipeline route for the gas .
The board said the export licenses would be issued on the condition that Canadian interests would also be allowed to bid for the Mackenzie delta gas on terms similar to those offered to U.S. customers .
U.S. buyers have already been lined up .
They include Enron Corp. Texas Eastern Corp. Pacific Interstate Transmission Co. and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co .
The project could result in the U.S. taking more than 10 % of its natural gas supplies from Canada up from about 5 % currently .
It would bring 13 gas fields into production at a combined rate of about 1.2 billion cubic feet a day .
The board estimated that the cost of building a pipeline from the Mackenzie delta to Alberta would be about 5.9 million .
It also said projections of surging U.S. demand for natural gas and price forecasts of 5.25 per thousand cubic feet by 2005 would make the project economically viable .
Esso a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd. which is 71%-owned by Exxon Corp. will be allowed to export 5.1 trillion cubic feet to the U.S. in the 20-year period .
Shell a subsidiary of Royal Dutch\/Shell Group will be allowed to export 0.9 trillion cubic feet and Gulf a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. will be allowed to export 3.2 trillion cubic feet .
Combustion Engineering Inc. Stamford Conn. said it sold and agreed to sell several investments and nonstrategic businesses for about 100 million which will be used for reducing debt and general purposes .
The transactions are unrelated .
The company agreed to sell its minority investments in makers of steam-generating and related equipment Stein Industrie and Energie & Verfahrenstechnik to the major shareholder in the companies Dutch-based GEC Alsthom N.V .
Combustion Engineering which provides engineered products systems and services for power generation also sold Illinois Minerals Co. based in Cairo Ill .
That unit of its Georgia Kaolin Co. subsidiary was sold to a unit of Unimin Corp .
Assets of Construction Equipment International Houston were sold to Essex Crane Inc. and the assets of Elgin Electronics Erie Pa. were sold to closely held Charter Technologies Inc .
Where do Americans put their money .
It depends on when you look .
In 1900 for instance less than 8 % of assets went into bank deposits .
That rose to nearly 18 % during the Depression and has n't changed much since .
Pension reserves on the other hand made up a relatively small part of household assets until the last decade when they skyrocketed .
And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms .
That 's some of what emerges from the following charts which show how Americans have changed their investment patterns over the past 90 years .
Some results are self-explanatory .
But other figures are surprising .
Housing for instance has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade although common wisdom would have expected an increase .
There is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth says Edward N. Wolff professor of economics at New York University .
But it has n't increased much relative to other assets .
It suggests that households accumulate wealth across a broad spectrum of assets .
And housing though it appears in the popular mind as being the major growing household asset is n't .
In addition investors ' desire to hold stocks directly and through mutual funds has held surprisingly steady stocks ' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market and not a shift in stock-holding preferences .
Stocks have not spread to the general public despite the fact that the environment is much different concludes Robert Avery an economist at Cornell University .
To me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets we have ways of holding wealth similar to 100 years ago .

McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it sent a letter to LIN Broadcasting Corp. clarifying its revised tender offer for LIN and asking LIN to conduct a fair auction .
The letter apparently came in response to a request for clarification by LIN earlier this week .
LIN which has agreed with BellSouth Corp. to merge their cellular-telephone businesses said then that it would n't take a position on McCaw 's revised tender offer .
Earlier this month McCaw revised its offer to 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares .
McCaw is seeking 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern the revised offer includes a feature requiring McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN .
The letter outlines broad powers for an independent group of directors provided for in the revised offer .
In a statement Craig O. McCaw chairman and chief executive officer of McCaw said We trust LIN will take no further actions that favor BellSouth .
McCaw said the three independent directors provided for in the offer would be designated by the current board .
The successors would be nominated by the independent directors .
LIN would have a priority right to pursue all opportunities to acquire U.S. cellular interests in markets other than those in which McCaw holds an interest or which are contiguous to those markets unless LIN has an interest there or contiguous to it .
Independent directors would have veto rights to any acquisition if they unanimously decide it is n't in LIN 's best interest .
Independent directors would be able to block transactions they unanimously deem would be likely to depress the private market value of LIN at the time it is to be sold in five years .
If LIN is put up for sale rather than purchased by McCaw in five years McCaw wo n't submit a bid unless the independent directors request it and the independent directors will run the bidding .
The directors would be able to sell particular assets to enable such buyers as the regional Bell operating companies to purchase the company 's interests .
MCA Inc. said third-quarter net fell 6.3 % to 50.8 million or 69 cents a share from 54.3 million or 74 cents a share a year earlier .
MCA said revenue rose 14 % to 918.4 million from 806.7 million .
The entertainment concern said the success of several movies released during the quarter including Parenthood and Uncle Buck contributed to record revenue for its film unit .
Both MCA 's music-entertainment and book-publishing units also posted record revenue and operating profit .
The parent company 's net included a loss which it did n't specify that was related to the company 's 50 % stake in Cineplex Odeon Corp .
Cineplex a Toronto theater chain had a second-quarter net loss of 38.7 million .
MCA said net also included certain reserves related to the restructuring of its LJN Toys ' international operations .
These items were partly offset MCA said by an unspecified gain on the sale of its Miller International unit a maker and distributor of budget-priced audio cassettes .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading MCA rose 1.50 to 64 .
In the nine months net rose 35 % to 120.1 million or 1.64 a share from 89.2 million or 1.22 a share a year earlier .
Revenue increased 22 % to 2.5 billion from 2.1 billion .

Helmsley Enterprises Inc. plans to close its company-owned insurance business and is seeking other brokers to take over its policies according to individuals familiar with the New York firm .
Helmsley Enterprises is the umbrella organization for companies controlled by Harry B. Helmsley .
These include office and residential real estate giant HelmsleySpear Inc. and Helmsley Hotels .
The insurance brokerage agency just a fragment of Helmsley 's vast empire would be the first piece of the company to be stripped away since last summer when Mr. Helmsley 's wife Leona Helmsley was found guilty of tax evasion .
Industry sources estimate the agency brokers property and casualty premiums worth about 25 million annually and has revenue based on a standard 10 % commission rate of about 2.5 million .
The insurance firm acts as a broker on policies covering buildings managed by HelmsleySpear and others .
Many of the properties are owned through limited partnerships controlled by Mr. Helmsley .
New York State law prohibits insurance brokerages from deriving more than 10 % of revenue from insuring affiliated companies .
Helmsley 's insurance division had slightly exceeded that percentage sources say but the division was n't considered significant enough to the company to be restructured particularly at a difficult time for the firm .
Adverse publicity from the scandal surrounding its founder 's wife and related management strife have put pressure on the entire Helmsley organization .
However individuals close to the company insist shuttering the insurance division a sideline from the company 's core property management business is n't the beginning of a sale of assets .
Helmsley 's insurance premiums are expected to be transferred to several different insurance brokerage companies .
Frank B. Hall Inc. of Briarcliff Manor N.Y. is reportedly working out an agreement with Helmsley .
Officials there declined to comment as did Helmsley management .
Outside the white-walled headquarters of the socalled Society of Orange Workers all seems normal in South Africa 's abnormal society .
A pickup truck driven by a white farmer rumbles past with a load of black workers bouncing in the back .
Over at Conradies the general store a black stock boy scurries to help an elderly white woman with her packages .
Down the street a car pulls into the Shell station and is surrounded by black attendants .
But inside the white walls of the Orange Workers ' office just about the largest building in town save for the Dutch Reformed Church and the school South Africa 's neat racial order is awry .
A dozen white office workers fold newsletters and stuff them into envelopes .
White women serve tea and coffee and then wash the cups and saucers afterwards .
White children empty the wastepaper baskets and squeegee the windows .
There is n't a black worker in sight .
Not in the kitchen or the storeroom or the book shop .
If we want to have our own nation then we must be willing to do all the work ourselves says Hendrik Verwoerd Jr. son of the former prime minister and the leader of the Orange Workers founded in 1980 .
They do indeed want their own nation .
The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of South Africa with Johannesburg opening its public facilities to all races blacks storming the all-white beaches of the Cape and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned African National Congress .
But here in Morgenzon a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal the Orange Workers are holding the pillars steady .
The Orange Workers who take their name from William of Orange of the Netherlands a hero of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners believe that the solution to South Africa 's racial problems is n't the abolition of apartheid it 's the perfection of apartheid complete and total separation of the races .
Here then is where the Orange Workers have come to make apartheid 's last stand .
Their idea is to create a city first and then an entire nation without blacks .
This may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in Africa .
And the fact that there are only 3,000 card-carrying Orange Workers may put them on the loony fringe .
But their ideal of an Afrikaner homeland an all-white reserve to be carved out of present-day South Africa is a mainstream desire of the right-wing which embraces about one-third of the country 's five million whites .
Afrikaner philosophers and theologians have long ruminated on the need for a white homeland .
The Orange Workers are just putting this preaching into practice .
Thus farmer Johan Fischer his T-shirt and jeans covered in grease crawls around under his planter tightening bolts and fixing dents .
On almost every other farm in South Africa black workers do the repairs .
But not here .
Mr. Fischer plows his own fields sows his own corn and sunflowers and feeds his own sheep .
Over at the fiberglass factory four white workers assemble water tanks on their own and in their spare time they build townhouses across the road .
On Main Street Alida Verwoerd and her daughters look after the clothes and fabric shop then hurry home to fix lunch for the rest of the family .
Down by the stream a group of Orange Workers puts the finishing touches on a golf course .
If whites want to play there by themselves says consulting engineer Willem van Heerden whites should also build it by themselves .
If we want to survive as a people he says we have to change our way of life .
The Afrikaner must end his reliance on others .
In their quest to perfect apartheid the Orange Workers have discovered a truth that most of privileged white South Africa tries mightily to deny The master ca n't become dependent on the slave and expect to remain master forever .
If apartheid means you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that go with it but you also want to exclude the blacks from social and political integration then these are two contradictions that ca n't go on forever says Mr. Verwoerd .
He is sitting in his living room beneath a huge portrait of his late father Hendrik F. Verwoerd apartheid 's architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966 .
Somewhere the son sighs things went terribly wrong with apartheid today whites even rely on blacks to police their separation .
People took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it .
But my father meant it to mean real separation says the son .
The Orange Workers speak sincerely .
We agree with world opinion that the status quo in South Africa is morally wrong says Pieter Bruwer the Orange Workers ' chief scribe and pamphleteer .
We must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly .
Morgenzon has long been a special domain of Afrikanerdom .
According to Mr. Verwoerd the early Afrikaner pioneers were the first people to settle in the eastern Transvaal even before the blacks .
Then when Morgenzon was incorporated in 1908 the farmer who owned the land stipulated that only whites could reside in town blacks could work there but they had to leave at night .
Today Morgenzon is a town of 800 whites and two paved roads .
Weeds push up through the cracks in the sidewalks and many houses and storefronts are empty .
There are few factories and no mines .
It was an ideal place for the Orange Workers to start their new nation unencumbered by the demographics that have undermined apartheid elsewhere in South Africa .
So far about 150 Orange Workers have moved here spending nearly 1 million buying up property over the past three years .
Still complete and total segregation remains elusive .
Just beyond the city limits is a shantytown of 2,000 blacks who are employed throughout the area .
Despite the Orange Workers ' intention to put them all out of work they are in no hurry to leave .
A young man called July that 's when he was born who works at the railroad station just up the street from the Orange Workers office points at the whitewalled building and says matter-of-factly We 're not allowed in there that 's all I know .
The 650-or-so local whites who are n't Orange Workers are more troubled .
Try as they might they just ca n't conceive of life without black workers .
Impossible impossible say the Conradies an elderly couple who have run the general store for decades .
We ca n't do without their help says Mrs. Conradie .
Oh no .
We need them and I thank God for them .
Over at the Shell station owner Rudi van Dyk who doubles as Morgenzon 's mayor worries that the Orange Workers have made his town the laughingstock of the nation .
What they want us to do just is n't practical he says noting that he employs 16 blacks .
I could n't afford to hire 16 whites .
The only Afrikaners who would be willing to work for this salary would n't know how to handle money .
Back at the Verwoerd house Hendrik Sr. peers down over the shoulder of Hendrik Jr .
The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no turning back the integration of South African society and politics Morgenzon will boom .
We urge our people not to wait until they have to fight for their own nation says Mr. Verwoerd .
By populating a place now we make ourselves a power any new government will have to take into account .
Curiously he compares the Orange Workers to the ANC which his father outlawed in 1960 .
The ANC wo n't be stopped until there is a provision for black aspirations says Mr. Verwoerd .
Likewise no government will stop this idea of the Afrikaners .
He apologizes for sounding pushy .
Look he says If the rest of South Africa wants to have an integrated melting pot that 's their choice .
We 'll leave them alone .
We just want to have our own cup of tea .
And they will even serve it themselves .
Okay now you can pick up that phone .
But do n't do anything rash .
After last Friday 's stock-market plunge investment professionals cautioned people to resist the urge to call their brokers and sell stocks .
Not selling into a panic turned out to be very good advice Despite the market 's volatility the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged 114 points in the past four days .
Now with a semblance of normalcy returning some advisers say it 's time for investors to take a hard cold look at the stocks they own and consider some careful pruning .
The market is sending nervous signals says Peter J. Canelo chief market strategist for Bear Stearns & Co. and it 's unwise to be overcommitted to stocks .
Alan Weston president of Weston Capital Management a Los Angeles money-management firm adds that in periods of uncertainty like today it 's a good time to cut out the dead branches of your portfolio .
Not everybody agrees that it 's time to trim .
We are n't inclined to prune stock portfolios now says Steven G. Einhorn chairman of the investment policy committee of Goldman Sachs & Co .
Investors should stay with their stocks .
We expect a choppy and sloppy market for a short period but we do n't think it will be ugly .
The downside is limited .
And even those who say some selective selling may be in order stress that individuals need to be in the stock market to achieve their long-term investment objectives and to help balance their other assets .
Any selling they say should be well thought-out and executed gradually during market rallies .
They offer these suggestions GET RID OF THE DOGS .
Sell stocks that are n't doing well now and that do n't have good earnings prospects says Alfred Goldman technical analyst at St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards & Sons .
Most people do just the opposite They sell their winners and keep their losers .
Which types of stocks are most likely to qualify .
Technology stocks says Mr. Goldman .
WATCH FOR EARNINGS DISAPPOINTMENTS .
A company does n't have to post a loss to be a candidate for sale says Charles I. Clough Jr. chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co .
If earnings do n't live up to analysts ' expectations he says that 's enough to dump the stock .
John Markese director of research for the American Association of Individual Investors raises a cautionary note .
Substituting a rule of thumb for your own judgment can be a mistake he says .
An earnings disappointment may reflect a situation that 's short-term .
But Mr. Clough says The risk is that earnings disappointments will continue .
The economy is decelerating after six good years and right now it 's better to shoot first and ask questions later .
Which types of stocks currently have the greatest earnings risks .
Computer companies commodity cyclical stocks like autos and retailing stocks he says .
BEWARE OF HEAVY DEBT .
The companies apt to run into earnings problems soonest are the ones with heavy debt loads says Larry Biehl partner in the San Mateo Calif. money-management firm of Bailard Biehl & Kaiser .
Mr. Canelo of Bear Stearns agrees If we do have an economic slowdown he says companies with high debt ratios will be dumped en masse .
The best course for individual investors is to sell these stocks now the two advisers say .
SELL WHISPER STOCKS .
UAL Corp. 's difficulty in obtaining bank financing for its leveraged buy-out and its resulting price plunge is a tip-off to what 's going to happen to takeover stocks says Mr. Canelo .
Takeover activity will slow down as more and more banks tighten their lending requirements he says .
There 'll be fewer and fewer deals .
Moreover many financial advisers say individuals should be in the stock market as long-term investors not as traders trying to catch the next hot stock .
In general they say avoid takeover stocks .
COMPARE P\/E RATIOS WITH PROSPECTS .
Mr. Canelo suggests that investors compare price\/earnings ratios the price of a share of stock divided by a company 's per-share earnings for a 12-month period with projected growth rates .
If you think earnings will grow at 20 % a year it 's all right to pay 20 times earnings he says .
But do n't pay 30 times earnings for a company that 's expected to grow at 15 % a year .
Mr. Canelo thinks the market will probably go higher but will be ruthless with stocks if the earnings are n't there .
Mr. Markese cautions that investors should n't slavishly follow any specific price\/earnings sell trigger .
If you say sell anytime a company 's price\/earnings ratio exceeds 15 that knocks out all your growth stocks he says .
You eliminate companies with substantial prospects that are moving up in price .
EXAMINE WHAT HAS CHANGED .
Tom Schlesinger market analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. says investors should consider selling if there has been a fundamental change in a company since they bought its stock .
Say you purchased a stock because of a new product that was in the works .
Now because of various difficulties the product has been scrapped .
Time to sell says Mr. Schlesinger .
Similarly he says suppose you were attracted to a company because of expectations that sales would hit 200 million by 1990 .
If things have n't worked out that well and sales wo n't hit 200 million until 1992 it 's time to consider selling he says .
USX Corp. declined a United Steelworkers request for a reopening of its four-year labor contract that is due to expire Jan. 31 1991 .
The union on Oct. 5 requested that the contract be reopened to restore all pay and benefits that the union gave up in the 1982-83 and 1986-87 rounds of bargaining .
A United Steelworkers spokeman said Lynn Williams the union 's president was out of town .
The union wo n't respond to the USX statement until Mr. Williams has studied it the spokesman said .

BankAmerica Corp. reported a 34 % jump in third-quarter earnings as its rocket-like recovery from nearly ruinous losses several years ago continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans higher interest margins and negligible loan losses .
For the quarter BankAmerica said it earned 254 million or 1.16 a share compared with 190 million or 97 cents a share a year earlier .
BankAmerica spokesmen said preliminary reports indicate the company was n't materially affected by the Tuesday earthquake .
All but eight of the 850 branches which had some structural damage reopened yesterday for business .
Automated teller machine operations also were up and operating yesterday a bank spokesman said .
For the first time in nearly two years BankAmerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters but the decline from the second quarter was attributable to special factors .
Third-quarter profit was 16 % below the 304 million or 1.50 a share earned in the 1989 second quarter .
The company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter totaling 63 million compared with 28 million in the third quarter .
Excluding tax credits profit was 6 % below the second quarter .
But that drop was caused entirely by a decline in Brazilian interest paid to 5 million from 54 million the second quarter .
Moreover BankAmerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to 170 million about the same as the previous quarter but well above the 100 million in the year-earlier quarter .
The provision rate was far above BankAmerica 's actual net credit losses of 24 million in the third quarter compared with 18 million in the seco
