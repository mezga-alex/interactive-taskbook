of trading Friday the Agriculture Department reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8.06 million cattle on Oct. 1 down 6 % from that date a year earlier .
Most analysts had expected the government to report a 4 % decline .
Feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef .
The government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5 % compared with the year-earlier quarter .
Many industry analysts had been projecting a 3 % decline in placements for the quarter .
In the 1988 quarter many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches .
The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable .
A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy .
The Agriculture Department also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered in the quarter dropped by 5 % from the 1988 quarter which was in line with projections by analysts .
Energy Friday 's 44-cent-a-barrel price drop to 19.98 in the expiring November contract for West Texas Intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board .
Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions .
Barring any petroleum-related news events trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm .
Copper Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon .
For example copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at 1.2345 a pound .
Pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes .
On Friday one analyst said rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia .
In Mexico the analyst added employees at the Cananea mine who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force .
The mine is expected to return to production in about a week .
On Friday selling dominated the afternoon curb session in London which takes place at noon EDT .
The premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed indicating weaker demand for cash copper .
Long-term support for the December contract was believed to be at 1.25 a pound .
A technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it .
That brought in considerable fund selling which continued until the close of trading .
In general it was a bearish close said Ben Hanauer a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co. a major commodities trading and brokerage firm .
But whether this price break has implications for this week he said we will know more when the London Metal Exchange copper stock levels are released Monday morning .
Another analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued .
Bernard Savaiko senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. said that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks they perceived a bearish sign .
He also noted that the Japanese who had been buying at prices just above the 1.25 level apparently pulled back from the market on Friday .
Mr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to 1.05 a pound .
Hewlett-Packard Co. will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other .
Called Task Broker the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together .
If a machine has a big computing task Task Broker asks other computers in the network for bids on the job .
It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine .
Hewlett-Packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast .
The new Hewlett-Packard program said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc. a computer-market research company is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing .
In today 's computer networks some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed .
With the Hewlett-Packard program he said You get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers .
The program which will be shipped in January 1990 runs on the Unix operating system .
Hewlett-Packard will charge 5,000 for a license covering 10 users .
The program now works on all Hewlett-Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford Conn .
Hewlett-Packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines .
The Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network .
A previously available program called Network Computing System developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division for instance takes a task and splits it up into parts divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing .
But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system .
Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker Hewlett-Packard said and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work .
The Task Broker turns that network into as far as the user is concerned one giant computer said Bill Kay general manager of Hewlett-Packard 's workstation group .
Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys the franchisees .
When elephants start fighting ants get killed says Murray Riese co-owner of National Restaurants a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut Roy Rogers and other chains .
As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another franchisers are struggling desperately for market share slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions .
The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees .
The chains used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow but in the last year or so discounting has become a 12-month thing says Donald Harty president of Charisma Group Inc. a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain .
Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year Mr. Harty says profits will be flat or lower .
And Bill Konopnicki a Safford Ariz. licensee of McDonald 's Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory Board says some fast-food outlets could be in serious trouble based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on .
Until recently the huge fast-food industry with sales of about 60.1 billion last year kept price-skirmishing to a minimum .
But early this year PepsiCo Inc. 's Taco Bell unit and Wendy 's International Inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions says John Rohs an analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Co .
That brought a chain reaction in the industry .
The situation was further aggravated early this month when McDonald 's set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons .
It also decided to go national with pizza which it has been test-marketing .
Now two-for-one deals on pizza are common so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high .
The discounting say fast-food operators occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before .
The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even laying off middle managers and working harder to make less .
Joe Mack a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. a Burger King operator in Omaha Neb. says discounting is so prevalent that we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers to keep sales level .
It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food he says .
Alan D'Agosto president of Panda 's Inc. an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha says All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming but we are n't increasing sales .
With fast-food outlets on every corner he like many does n't think he has a choice in the price war Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon .
If the battle continues much longer many fast-food businesses will close or merge predicts Vincent Morrissey who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest .
The industry is overbuilt he says .
Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available .
The National Restaurant Association says quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 the last year for which figures are available .
With the market so crowded says a spokesman for Wendy 's in Columbus Ohio If you 're doing well you 're doing well at someone else 's expense .
Simply put there is n't enough business for every store to grow .
According to Mr. Rohs inflation-adjusted same-store sales at company-owned Wendy 's units in the U.S. have trailed year-earlier levels throughout 1989 except for August .
McDonald 's has also been running negative all year the analyst says .
Spokesmen for Wendy 's and McDonald 's criticized Mr. Rohs 's calculations .
Jack Greenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald '
