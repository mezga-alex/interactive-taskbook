In East Germany where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism they 're not laughing about their new leader Egon Krenz .
Mr. Krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him .
You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes says an East German mother of two who loves swapping political barbs with her friends .
With Krenz we just do n't know what to expect .
Mr. Krenz does n't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old Politburo member was selected last week to succeed Erich Honecker .
But he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either .
According to East Germany 's ADN news agency Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged East Germany could learn from Moscow 's glasnost policies .
Already last week Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media .
On Thursday a day after he took office East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer .
The regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet-style glasnost .
It was quite a shock says a 43-year-old East German shopkeeper .
For the first time in my life I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television .
Other changes including easing restrictions on travel for East Germans are expected .
But whether such moves can win back the confidence of East Germans who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes depends largely on whether they feel they can trust Mr. Krenz .
And that 's a problem .
Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor Mr. Honecker but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators .
I hope he grows with the job says Rainer Eppelmann a Protestant pastor in East Berlin .
The most important thing is that he have a chance .
Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades .
Unlike Mr. Honecker who tended to lecture people about socialist values Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions .
Indeed one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers a la Gorbachev .
He was later shown on television fielding questions .
At one point he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies .
The worker 's tart reply It 's more than just travel .
People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society .
The exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies .
This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring .
Rather than trying to lecture us says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting Mr. Krenz wanted to listen .
Rep. Ronnie Flippo D. Ala. one of the members of the delegation says he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz 's ready admission that East Germany needed to change .
He 's a very tough man but one who 's also open to arguments adds an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
But there 's another side to Mr. Krenz .
Born in a Baltic town in an area which is now part of Poland he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus .
He moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron Mr. Honecker and emerged as the heir apparent .
Barbara Donovan an expert on East Germany at Radio Free Europe in Munich says Mr. Krenz may project a smooth image but she doubts he 's a true reformer .
Even if he is she adds he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party 's ruling Politburo .
Against this background the new East German leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing .
The sudden growth of the opposition movement together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers ' uprising in 1953 .
He does n't have any honeymoon period says a Western diplomat based in East Berlin .
But if he 's sharp and quick he has a chance .
The diplomat adds that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him .
The East German economy is strong compared with other East bloc nations .
And his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image contrasting with the perception of Mr. Honecker as an out-of-touch old man .
For average East Germans Mr. Krenz remains a puzzle .
Either he was n't being real in the past or he is n't being real right now says a 30-year-old East German doctor .
Either way I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed .
The doctor was among dozens of people milling through East Berlin 's Gethsemane Church Saturday morning .
The walls of the church are covered with leaflets news clippings and handwritten notes associated with the country 's political opposition .
I have to come here to read the walls says the doctor because it 's information I still ca n't get through the newspapers .
Meanwhile East Germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor .
Television last week carried a new report on East Berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production .
East Germans remember a comment a few years ago by Kurt Hager the government 's top ideologist that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper there 's no reason to change your own .
His point was there is no reason for East Germany to copy Soviet-style changes .
It 's hard to know whether it was intended to be funny says the East Berlin shopkeeper But everyone I know laughed about it .
The list of laboratories claiming to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from cold fusion experiments is slowly growing .
But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms .
New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions leaving only the finding of tritium in a Texas experiment to support University of Utah chemists ' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures .
The latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in 24 reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the Electrochemical Society the first scientific meeting in five months to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments .
The meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research .
Of the 1,300 chemists registered for the society 's weeklong meeting fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week 's end .
This was in contrast with the society 's meeting last May at the height of the controversy when more than 1,500 scientists along with scores of reporters and TV crews crowded into a Los Angeles hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject .
Neither of the two chemists whose Utah experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons were at the meeting .
But some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the Department of Energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience .
The committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether DOE should support cold fusion research .
Most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons .
The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into heavy water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium .
When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes the heavy water did begin to break up or dissociate .
Ordinarily the electrolysis or breakup of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy .
But Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat .
The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in they reported .
Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation they asserted that the excess heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod .
As of last weekend a dozen labs also have reported measuring excess heat from similar electrolytic experiments although amounts of such heat vary widely .
One of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by Richard A. Oriani professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota .
Mr. Oriani said his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results .
But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who said they were getting excess heat .
The results were fascinating he said .
On the fourth run with the borrowed rod the experiment began producing excess heat .
The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument .
When it was restarted heat output really took off and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down he said .
Typical of other experiments Mr. Oriani said his experiment was very erratic .
It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down .
The excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water .
Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times as some scientists have suggested .
There is a reality to the excess energy he said .
Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time .
The bursts often occur they said after they perturbed the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied or switching the current off and on .
One chemist privately suggested this hinted that some anomalous chemical reactions might be producing the heat .
One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements .
Typically the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt .
One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells .
A cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it reported Turgut M. Gur an associate of materials scientist Robert A. Huggins head of the Stanford experimental team .
One of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist John Bockris of Texas A&M University .
Mr. Bockris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water .
He said that within the past few days he 's gotten evidence that there is a weak correlation between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium .
There is n't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water so it 's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon .
Increasingly careful attempts to measure neutron
