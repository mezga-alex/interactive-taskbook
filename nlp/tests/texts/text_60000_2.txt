s says the company does n't compute much less disclose inflation-adjusted same-store sales .
He adds that short-term comparisons can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year .
Profit margins at company-owned McDonald 's outlets in the U.S. are holding up quite nicely says Mr. Greenberg .
Profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s he adds .
But Mr. Greenberg 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers .
Smaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail many in the industry predict .
Big franchise groups can ride out the storm a lot longer says Mr. Harty the Burger King operator in New York .
The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees .
Mr. Morrissey the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties or portion of sales that they must pay franchisers .
Franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting .
But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end says Lew Rudnick a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients .
He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing .
In any case many franchisees in order to stay on good terms with franchisers routinely go along with promotions .
Says Mr. Riese of National Restaurants If you resisted on prices maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise .

CalMat Co. said it completed a 32.8 million sale of assets from its Los Angeles area real estate portfolio for net income of 12 million .
CalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt concrete rock and sand .
And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an IRS audit .
Reggie Jackson the retired baseball star has found another use for them .
Mr. Jackson who won the nickname Mr. October for his World Series exploits is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as 500 each .
Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. Jackson 's canceled checks is unusual .
I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it says Jack Smalling a dealer in Ames Iowa and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs .
An initial batch of Mr. Jackson 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend .
Mr. Jackson showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well .
For someone who has everything else Reggie 's jersey cap and cards his checks might be a nice addition says William Vizas owner of Bill 's Sports Collectibles in Denver who examined the checks at the San Francisco card show .
For years the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold .
But these players were dead .
Maybe three years ago there were a lot of Ty Cobbs in the hobby and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks says Mr. Smalling .
However the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way .
Maybe I 'm a little stuffy but I would n't sell them sniffs Bob Machon owner of Papa 's Sports Cards in Menlo Park Calif .
Who knows how much they 'll be worth 100 years from now .
And Mr. Smalling does n't believe they 're worth all that much now .
I do n't think the checks are worth 15 apiece he says .
Why Mr. Jackson who could n't be reached for comment has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear .
He probably has n't done it for the cash .
I would say he 's definitely not in need of money says Matt Merola an agent of Mr. Jackson 's based in New York .
He has good investments .
And Mr. Jackson probably has opened new checking accounts too .
Or at least he should .
I assume those accounts are closed says Mr. Smalling referring to the accounts of the canceled checks .
I do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers .
USX Corp. and its Japanese partner Kobe Steel Ltd. agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products mainly for the automotive market .
Terms were n't disclosed for the plant which will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons .
The move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies .
Bethlehem Steel Corp. LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel .
The surge in production analysts say raises questions about capacity outpacing demand .
They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 when the current import trade restraint program ends which could result in more imports .
There 's too much capacity contended Charles Bradford an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
I do n't think there 's anyone not building one .
He does add however that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos instead of relying heavily on imported steel .
That trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet .
The hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills those spun off to employees .
Indeed USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 .
For the first eight months of 1989 analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % .
USX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 .
USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production .
Moreover it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons .
The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines .
Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel .
One of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly .
ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment the rest is easy right .
You just call your broker and say buy or sell .
Dream on .
There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing .
So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges .
Two things to keep in mind Not all exchanges accept every type of order .
And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer .
Market Order This is probably the most widely used order and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers since it imposes no price restrictions .
With a market order an investor tells a broker to buy or sell at the market .
It 's like saying get me in now or get me out now .
For example if wheat is being offered at 4.065 and bid at 4.060 a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price .
A recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers .
Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers .
Limit Order Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment .
Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it .
Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than 55 .
A limit order to sell could be entered at that price .
One risk Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls .
Unless the market goes at least one tick the smallest price increment permitted beyond the limit price investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price .
Stop Order Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level .
Once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get .
Stop orders are sometimes called stop-loss orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses .
While stop orders sound similar to limit orders there is a difference Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above .
In contrast sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below .
The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do .
An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at 90 under a stock that was trading at 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday .
Stop-Limit Order Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order .
Unlike stop orders which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price .
If it ca n't be made at that price it does n't get filled .
Investors who wish to be out of a position without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled .
But if the market moves quickly enough it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price .
Market-If-Touched Order Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached .
However unlike a buy-stop order a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it .
As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price .
Fill-Or-Kill Order The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades .
It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better .
But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately the order is automatically canceled .
Gregory Bessemer who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options .
I like to use them to feel out the market he says .
If they do n't fill it immediately then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price .
Not-Held Order This is another timing order .
It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment if they think they can get a better price by waiting .
Not-held orders which are also known as disregard the tape orders are always done at the customer 's risk .
One-Cancels-The-Other Order This is really two orders in one generally for the same security or commodity instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order .
In a fast-moving market it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security .
Specific-Time Order This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time .
On the close can be added to many types of orders .
For example market-on-close orders must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange .
Stop-close-only orders are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading .
Day orders expire at the end of the day on which they are entered good-till-canceled orders have no expiration date .
Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise .
On Oct. 19 1987 some investors learned the consequences of entering good-til-canceled limit orders and then forgetting about them .
They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel .
It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed .
Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are usually stuck with the consequences .
Mr. Angrist writes on the options and commodities markets for The Wall Street Journal .
IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments there 's probably no starting place better than beta .
But investors better not ignore its limitations either .
Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund .
For any given move in the overall market it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall .
Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret .
The beta of the broad market typically defined as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index is always 1.0 .
So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile and so on .
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas .
Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market .
Remember though that beta also has important limitations .
Beta is only part of the risk in a stock says William F. Sharpe the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure .
There is risk that is not associated with market moves and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that .
In particular beta does n't measure the company and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock .
That business risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio .
Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer .
In particular the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired .
Concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the American Association of Individual Investors to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual-fund guide .
Our fear was people would look just at the beta of a gold fund and say here is an investment with very low risk says John Markese director of research for the Chicago-based group .
In reality it 's very volatile but the movements are not because of market movements .
READY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio .
First a pop quiz .
When you think of the words risk and investment what 's the specific peril that comes to mind .
Pencils down .
If you 're like most people you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding .
People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension says Timothy Kochis national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte Haskins & Sells .
But therein lies another aspect of investment risk the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others .
This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs .
Risk wears many disguises and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other less obvious kinds .
U.S. Treasury bonds for example are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity .
But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments .
Risk is also a function of time .
When financial professionals measure risk mathematically they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns .
Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills for example because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider .
That is usually measured by the standard deviation or divergence of annual results from the average return over time .
But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals .
For instance some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash last Friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings .
But the stock market despite some stomach-churning declines has far outperformed other securities over extended periods .
By retreating to the apparent security of say money-market funds investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement .
That 's the biggest risk of all the risk of not meeting your objectives says Steven B. Enright a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services .
As a result financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients ' portfolios .
They estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year .
They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals .
And they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified .
The portfolios of two hypothetical families one a couple at retirement age and another a two-income couple at age 45 illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider .
For instance the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk .
But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk .
The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue .
Note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return 10.1 % vs. 8.8 % as calculated by Seidman Financial Services which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman .
That largely reflects the heavy stockholdings .
But one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility as reflected in the higher standard deviation that Seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio .
Here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it .
Then take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation .
In two of three years the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate .
Then add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range .
There 's a 95 % probability any year 's result will fall in the range .
Of course the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals .
Indeed the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans .
They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market says John H. Cammack a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington .
But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future .
Ms. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau .
When it comes to investing trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver or the ups and downs that will occur along the way .
Looking to the past can provide some clues .
Over several decades for instance investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and cash investments like Treasury bills .
But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself .
For instance some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market .
And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past .

Portfolio B Two-income couple age 45 150,000 portfolio .
A letter from Senator John Kerry chides us today for implying that he had flip-flopped on Manuel Noriega .
He correctly says he has been down on Noriega for some time hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup .
Our October 12 editorial should have been more precise .
It meant to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega to include other notorious Central American drug runners .
The Sandinistas of Nicaragua for example also are part of the Castro-Medellin cartel nexus .
In his letter and on the basis of his losing vote Tuesday against U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan opposition Senator Kerry makes clear he has not made that intellectual leap .
We were wrong .
THROUGHOUT THE 1980s investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning .
Capital has been democratized and people want in .
Too often however small investors are left with the same stale solutions that appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists .
Now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit .
This is particularly good news for those who hate risk who are incapable of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way .
You know who you are .
My revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion .
Like all Americans seeking chronic prosperity I do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools if only to assuage my father-in-law who believes in such things .
So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs and tinkered with stocks bonds and mutual funds as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market .
Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative .
Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I 've invested in during this prosperous decade see accompanying illustration WSJ Oct. 20 1989 .
Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 at which point the industry while not lighting up any Christmas trees began a slow recovery .
Likewise mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was for me a serious investment .
By 1987 these properties were in a tailspin causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she 'd never seen anything like it .
Concerned for her state of mind I dropped them and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health .
Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years .
Disgusted I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me I was doing it already .
We 've all got money to spend some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it .
Bank it .
Not really .
Sock it away in long-term instruments .
Nonsense .
Daily living is the best possible investment .
Your priorities may be different but here in Figure 2 is where I 've chosen to build for the future personal space automotive pursuits children 's toys gardening equipment bulbs and shrubs and finally entertainment perhaps the best investment of all .
All have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential .
At least according to my calculations .
Personal space Figure 3 has grown 35 % annually over the course of the decade a performance that would compare positively with an investment in say synthetic-leather products for the interiors of cold-weather vehicles which my cousin got into and sort of regrets to this day .
The assortment of expensive children 's toys that I have purchased wisely at a host of discount-toy brokerage firms Figure 4 has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except perhaps for my record collection whose worth I think it 's safe to say is incalculable .
Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy Figure 5 with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value .
According to my calculations these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than 22,000 on the open market Figure 6 where I plan to offer it shortly .
Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale .
I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers .
My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold according to my conservative calculations .
At the same time my share in a wide variety of entertainment pursuits has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning .
Over the course of the decade for instance my return on investment in the area of poker alone Figures 7A and 7B has been most impressive showing bodacious annual expansion with given the way my associates play no sign of abatement into the 1990s and beyond .
With this personal strategy firmly in place I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage .
My kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending although I 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it .
But with every step I take I 'm building wealth .
You can too if you like me refuse to bite the bullet .
So go out there and eat that debt .
You 're right there in the mainstream of American business building value on the back of insupportable expenditures .
Henry Kravis watch out .
Mr. Schwartz is a business executive and writer in New York .
WHEN JAMES SCHWARTZ was just a lad his father gave him a piece of career advice .
He told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre I could be great recalls Mr. Schwartz now 40 .
He tried management consulting traded in turquoise for a while and even managed professional wrestlers .
Now he has settled into a career that fits the bill financial planning .
It should be noted that Mr. Schwartz who operates out of Englewood Colo. is a puckish sort who likes to give his colleagues the needle .
But in this case the needle has a very sharp point .
Though it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent the fact remains that as one wag puts it anybody who can fog a mirror can call himself a financial planner .
Planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars but in effect they operate in the dark .
There is no effective regulation of planners no accepted standard for admission into their ranks a dog got into one trade group no way to assess their performance no way even to know how many of them there are estimates range from 60,000 to 450,000 .
All anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning .
So it should come as no shock that the profession if that 's what it is has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients ' money .
Alarmed state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners .
Industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards too they 're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine .
But reform has n't taken hold yet .
The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days says Scott Stapf director of investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Association .
An admittedly limited survey by NASAA whose members are state securities-law regulators found that between 1986 and 1988 fraud and abuse by financial planners cost 22,000 investors 400 million .
The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons a compulsive gambler or two various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother .
What 's more the losses they and the others caused are just what we are stumbling over says Mr. Stapf adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected .
So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners .
Nobody can estimate the toll but John Gargan a Tampa Fla. planner and head of one trade group the International Association of Registered Financial Planners thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is humongous far greater than that from crookery .
His group like others wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners .
Surveying all this some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all .
For most investors the benefits just are n't worth the risks says Barbara Roper who follows financial-planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America a consumer-advocacy organization based in Washington .
She concedes that such a position is unfair to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it .
She says her group used to give tips on selecting planners check educational and experience credentials consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus but found that even some people who took these steps were still getting ripped off .
The bad news however has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning .
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business .
But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners IAFP the industry 's biggest trade group is still nearly triple what it was in 1980 and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well .
An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners and the pool of capital they influence is enormous .
A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months .
The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult if not impossible to regulate .
Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as investment advisers people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity .
The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers about the same as in 1980 even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade .
Currently a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years .
A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years .
It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem says Kathryn McGrath director of the SEC 's division of investment management .
So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers which operates in the brokerage business .
Such an organization could among other things set minimum standards for competence ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules .
The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with .
Mr. Schwartz the puckish planner from Englewood Colo. says that allowing the business to police itself would be like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank .
Mr. Gargan the Tampa planner who heads one trade group favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff .
Mr. Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP the major industry organization .
When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners Mr. Gargan 's group was excluded .
That may be because Mr. Gargan smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group enrolled his dog Beauregard as a member of the IAFP .
Then he sent the pooch 's picture with the certificate of membership it was made out to Boris Bo Regaard to every newspaper he could think of .
The states have their own ideas about regulation and certification .
NASAA the organization of state securities regulators is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states .
It requires financial planners to register with states pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest .
The most common conflict involves compensation .
NASAA estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they recommend .
The issue Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments or the ones that garner the biggest commissions .
In 1986 the New York attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp. an Albany financial-planning firm that had invested 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors .
In its notice of action the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into balanced investment portfolios instead the attorney general alleged the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings coins and Florida condos .
Those investments paid big commissions to First Meridian payments investors were never told about the attorney general alleged .
Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted .
In practice the attorney general alleged in an affidavit if an investor had access to cash the chances of being turned down by First Meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month Club .
And the attorney general added First Meridian 's president Roger V. Sala portrayed himself as a financial expert when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma work as a real-estate and insurance salesman and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth .
First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general .
Harry Manion Mr. Sala 's attorney says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general 's contentions about First Meridian 's business practices are incorrect .
As for Mr. Sala 's qualifications the snooty attorneys for the state of New York decided Mr. Sala was n't qualified because he did n't have a Harvard degree says Mr. Manion .
Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common .
Two such actions both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta could be particularly embarrassing to the industry both name J. Chandler Peterson an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP as defendant .
One suit filed by more than three dozen investors charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest .
Those companies in turn paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees the suit alleges .
The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale Ariz .
One plaintiff a doctor testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician the privilege of making additional investments with Mr. Peterson .
In affidavits each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned .
Mr. Peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors .
Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots he opened up his briefcase and dumped 1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors says Myron Diebel the bank 's president .
He said he wanted to show the color of his money recalls Mr. Diebel .
Bank officials however showed him the door and the sale never came off .
According to the suit Mr. Peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment .
They want it back .
Mr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits saying he prefers to save such responses for court .
But he does say that all of his activities have been entirely proper .
On the suit by the limited partners he says he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs .
The suit he adds is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people .
Rearding the suit over the bank bid Mr. Peterson says it is filled with inflammatory language and half truths .
He declines to go into specifics .
Mr. Peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a sign of the times in which people generally are more prone to sue .
I do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation he says .
Mr. Peterson also says he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore .
He now calls himself an investment banker .
In many scams or alleged scams involving planners it 's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm 's way .
Using it would n't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner .
Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies If it sounds too good to be true it probably is .
Certificates of deposit do n't pay 23 % a year for example but that did n't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner .
Now they 're losers and he 's in jail in Mobile County .
CDs yielding 40 % are even more implausible especially when the issuing bank in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator but investors fell for that one too .
And the Colorado planner who promised to make some of his clients millionaires on investments of as litle as 100 .
Never mind .
You already know the answer .
Mr. Emshwiller is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Los Angeles bureau .
At the ritzy Fashion Island Shopping Center the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy Southern California beach community disembark from their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs for another day of exercising their credit cards .
They root among the designer offerings at Neiman-Marcus and Bullocks Wilshire .
They stroll through the marble-encased corridors of the Atrium Court .
They graze at the Farmers Market a combination gourmet food court and grocery store while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies .
The beautiful look of wool croons the show 's narrator slightly Victorian in its influence .
Meanwhile in the squat office buildings that ring Fashion Island the odds are good that someone is getting fleeced .
Law-enforcement authorities say that at any given time a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here .
They seem to like these industrial parks says Kacy McClelland a postal inspector who specializes in mail fraud .
We call them fraud farms .
Welcome to that welter of contradictions known as Newport Beach .
This city of more than 70,000 is known for sunshine yachts and rich residents .
It is also known as the fraud capital of the U.S. dubbed by investigators and the media as the Cote de Fraud .
How does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for low-lifes .
Clearly the existence of the former lures the latter .
The places renowned for breeding bunco like the Miami neighborhood known as the Maggot Mile and Las Vegas 's flashy strip of casinos invariably offer fast cars high rollers glamorous women and lots of sunshine .
You do n't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in Green Bay or Buffalo .
Con men hate snow .
Newport Beach fits the scam artists ' specifications perfectly .
What more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for .
Nothing seems hard here .
The breezes are soft the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily .
Nightlife is plentiful .
Moreover ostentation is appreciated .
The median price of homes is 547,000 more than 9,000 vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest pleasure-boat harbor .
Blondes cocaine and Corvettes mutters Mr. McClelland .
That 's what they 're after .
The rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability .
One reason they use Newport Beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses says David Katz a U.S. attorney who until recently headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force .
Newport Beach is known in Rhode Island for having a lot of rich people .
No wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here from phony tax-sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders .
But above all this is the national headquarters for boiler-room operators those slick-talking snake-oil salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish .
Because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest .
I 've heard that there is 40 billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year Mr. McClelland says .
If that 's true Orange County has to be at least 10 % of that .
And most of the truly big scams in Orange County seem to originate in Newport Beach or one of the other well-heeled communities that surround this sliver-like city that hooks around a point of land on the California coast south of Los Angeles .
In fact sophisticated big-bucks boiler-room scams are known generically among law-enforcement types as Newport Beach operations .
That contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as Hollywood scams .
Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot .
The investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals .
In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses caused by employees due to dishonesty destruction or disappearance according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month .
Thus falsely reassured investors sent 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses the indictment charges .
Douglas Jones an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr. the chairman and president of Capital Trust says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors .
There were some business deals that went bad Mr. Jones says but no intent to defraud .
Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars .
Traditionally boiler rooms operate on the cheap since few if any customers ever visit their offices .
Indeed the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space near the boiler room .
But says Mr. Katz the U.S. attorney the interesting thing about Newport Beach operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices with plush furnishings .
When we go there it 's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses .
The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately .
Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals .
Mr. Valentine who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle an island in Newport 's harbor according to investigators .
With the 3 million received from investors he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits .
It 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas Mr. Katz says .
All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element .
Vincent M Ciavarella regional manager of Property Management Systems insists he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co. the owner and developer of the project .
Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided incomplete financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators are not easily detectable .
Investigators stress that building owners are victims too since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent .
Richard Luehrs president of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce calls boiler rooms a negative we wish we could get rid of .
Actually we do n't get much negative publicity about this he insists except for the press who write about it .
Mr. Lancaster is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal 's Dallas bureau .
YOU WENT to college and thought you got an education .
Now you discover that you never learned the most important lesson How to send your kids to college .
True when you went to college there was n't that much to learn .
Stick some money in an interest-bearing account and watch it grow .
Now investment salesmen say it 's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your toddler a ticket to Prestige U. in 18 years .
In short throw away the passbook and go for the glory .
The reason is cost .
Nothing in the annals of tuition readied parents for the 1980s .
Tuitions at private colleges rose 154 % in the 10 years ended in June of this year that 's twice the 77 % increase in consumer prices for the same period .
A year at Harvard now goes for 19,395 .
By 2007 when this year 's newborns hit campus a four-year Ivy League sheepskin will cost 300,000 give or take a few pizzas-with-everything at exam time .
Stanford MIT and other utmosts will cost no less .
So what 's a parent to do .
Some investment advisers are suggesting in effect a bet on a start-up investment pool maybe even on margin .
Others prefer deep-discount zero-coupon bonds .
Still others say Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund .
You 're not going to make it in a 5 % bank account says James Riepe director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price .
To get the necessary growth adds Murray Ruffel a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group you need to go to the stock market .
In other words a little volatility never hurt .
It never hurt anyone that is unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to .
Or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid 's tuition .
That 's the dilemma for today 's parent .
Although many experts are advising risk no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off .
Help may be on the way .
The antitrust division of the Justice Department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools .
Fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s .
And then there 's always State U .
But parents ' craving for a top-rated education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine .
Belatedly aware of public concern lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes .
Their message explicit or implicit is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore .
Forget about Treasury bills or a money-market fund .
The latest wave of marketing is instructive .
Several outfits including the Financial Programs Franklin and T. Rowe Price mutual-fund groups and the Edward D. Jones brokerage house are advertising college planner tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly .
The calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of 8 % annually a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one place the stock market .
Most of the mailers are free but Denver-based Financial Programs sells for 15 a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice .
The figures are shocking .
To build a nest egg that would pay for Stanford when a current first-grader reaches college age parents would need to set aside 773.94 a month for 12 years .
They can cut this to 691.09 a month if the investing keeps up through college .
And they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier when mother and child come home from the hospital .
Plugging a cheaper college into the formulas still does n't generate an installment most people can live with .
Using a recent average private-school cost of about 12,500 a year T. Rowe Price 's planner prescribes 450 monthly if the plan begins when the child is six .
Since the formula assumes an 8 % before-tax return in a mutual fund there would also be 16,500 in taxes to pay over the 12 years .
Not everyone is so pessimistic .
People are basically peddling a lot of fear says Arthur Hauptman a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington .
He takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution which reduces most parents ' burden substantially .
Still he says it 's no bad thing if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more .
The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income he says .
That 's crazy .
His advice Do n't panic .
Parents he says should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford .
Half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal he adds .
That way parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition .
Mr. Hauptman reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages .
He favors either an all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds .
In their anxiety however parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes .
They have laid out about 1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bonds so far offered by Connecticut Illinois Virginia and eight other states .
And they have bought about 500 million in prepaid-tuition plans offered in Michigan Florida and Wyoming .
The prepaid plans take payment today usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow .
The baccalaureate bonds tax-free offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity seem to be tailor-made for college savers .
Like other zeros they pay all their interest at maturity meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when Junior graduates from high school .
Their compounding effect is also alluring .
In June Virginia sold bonds for 268.98 that will pay 1,000 in 2009 .
But Richard Anderson head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives at Columbia University a research group partly financed by the federal government says zeros are particularly ill-suited .
Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up .
That wo n't matter if they are held to maturity but if for any reason the parents need to sell them before then there could be a severe loss of principal .
Had zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time aiming for their children 's 1988 enrollment they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years Mr. Anderson figures .
Most other bonds however would probably not have fared much better .
The prepaid plans may be a good bet provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure .
Issuing states generally limit the guarantees to in-state institutions however and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools .
Two private groups are seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval for plans that could be more broadly transferable .
Mr. Anderson wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan .
The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee .
Prepayments much like mutual-fund purchases are pooled for investment .
Sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns .
But buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so .
One problem is that the Internal Revenue Service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable .
The colleges as educational institutions had hoped that would n't be the case .
Based on historical rates of return Mr. Anderson reckons a 100 % stock portfolio indexed to the market would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century .
But sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market .
And they 're leaning more toward fixed income whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases .
I 'm not sure they 're going to make it work says Mr. Anderson .
What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions .
Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack .
Not so Michigan .
Its plan is set up as an independent agency .
The state says there 's no worry investment returns combined with fees and the gains from unused plans will provide all the cash it needs .
Mr. Putka covers education from The Wall Street Journal 's Boston bureau .
If you start saving for your child 's eduction on Jan. 1 1990 here 's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at Yale Notre Dame and University of Minnesota .
Figures assume a 7 % annual rise in tuition fees room and board and an 8 % annual investment return .

AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County Miss. Allen D. Tharp of Isola was one of the best known and most enterprising .
He sold quarter-inch fingerlings to stock other farmers ' ponds and he bought back one-pound-or-so food-fish that he live-hauled to market along with his own whiskery crop .
And he nearly always bought and sold for cash .
Along the way Mr. Tharp omitted a total of 1.5 million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years .
The returns landed in the hands of an Internal Revenue Service criminal investigator Samuel James Baker .
Mr. Baker interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers live-haulers and processors throughout the South before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales in pounds and dollars by Mr. Tharp and others .
Unknown to Mr. Tharp he had fouled his net on a special IRS project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes .
Confronted with the evidence Mr. Tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined 5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison .
He also owes a lot of back taxes interest and civil fraud penalties .
