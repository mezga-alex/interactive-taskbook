2 .
Formally or informally train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's due-process approach .
See that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards for it is the law governing company courts and adjudicators .

Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator .
A panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and for the panelists mutual support .

International Business Machines and Bank of America are among the companies using the single-adjudicator approach .
4 .
Make your due-process system visible .
It wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it .
Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints .
On the other hand they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists .

Naturally one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it .
