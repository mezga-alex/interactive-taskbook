a chance .
Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades .
Unlike Mr. Honecker who tended to lecture people about socialist values Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions .
Indeed one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers a la Gorbachev .
He was later shown on television fielding questions .
At one point he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies .
The worker 's tart reply It 's more than just travel .
People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society .
The exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies .
This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring .
Rather than trying to lecture us says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting Mr. Krenz wanted to listen .
Rep. Ronnie Flippo D. Ala. one of the members of the delegation says he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz 's ready admission that East Germany needed to change .
He 's a very tough man but one who 's also open to arguments adds an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
But there 's another side to Mr. Krenz .
Born in a Baltic town in an area which is now part of Poland he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus .
He moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron Mr. Honecker and emerged as the heir apparent .
Barbara Donovan an expert on East Germany at Radio Free Europe in Munich says Mr. Krenz may project a smooth image but she doubts he 's a true reformer .
Even if he is she adds he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party 's ruling Politburo .
Against this background the new East German leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing .
The sudden growth of the opposition movement together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers ' uprising in 1953 .
He does n't have any honeymoon period says a Western diplomat based in East Berlin .
But if he 's sharp and quick he has a chance .
The diplomat adds that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him .
The East German economy is strong compared with other East bloc nations .
And his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image contrasting with the perception of Mr. Honecker as an out-of-touch old man .
For average East Germans Mr. Krenz remains a puzzle .
Either he was n't being real in the past or he is n't being real right now says a 30-year-old East German doctor .
Either way I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed .
The doctor was among dozens of people milling through East Berlin 's Gethsemane Church Saturday morning .
The walls of the church are covered with leaflets news clippings and handwritten notes associated with the country 's political opposition .
I have to come here to read the walls says the doctor because it 's information I still ca n't get through the newspapers .
Meanwhile East Germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor .
Television last week carried a new report on East Berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production .
East Germans remember a comment a few years ago by Kurt Hager the government 's top ideologist that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper there 's no reason to change your own .
His point was there is no reason for East Germany to copy Soviet-style changes .
It 's hard to know whether it was intended to be funny says the East Berlin shopkeeper But everyone I know laughed about it .
The list of laboratories claiming to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from cold fusion experiments is slowly growing .
But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms .
New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions leaving only the finding of tritium in a Texas experiment to support University of Utah chemists ' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures .
The latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in 24 reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the Electrochemical Society the first scientific meeting in five months to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments .
The meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research .
Of the 1,300 chemists registered for the society 's weeklong meeting fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week 's end .
This was in contrast with the society 's meeting last May at the height of the controversy when more than 1,500 scientists along with scores of reporters and TV crews crowded into a Los Angeles hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject .
Neither of the two chemists whose Utah experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons were at the meeting .
But some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the Department of Energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience .
The committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether DOE should support cold fusion research .
Most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons .
The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into heavy water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium .
When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes the heavy water did begin to break up or dissociate .
Ordinarily the electrolysis or breakup of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy .
But Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat .
The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in they reported .
Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation they asserted that the excess heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod .
As of last weekend a dozen labs also have reported measuring excess heat from similar electrolytic experiments although amounts of such heat vary widely .
One of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by Richard A. Oriani professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota .
Mr. Oriani said his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results .
But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who said they were getting excess heat .
The results were fascinating he said .
On the fourth run with the borrowed rod the experiment began producing excess heat .
The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument .
When it was restarted heat output really took off and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down he said .
Typical of other experiments Mr. Oriani said his experiment was very erratic .
It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down .
The excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water .
Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times as some scientists have suggested .
There is a reality to the excess energy he said .
Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time .
The bursts often occur they said after they perturbed the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied or switching the current off and on .
One chemist privately suggested this hinted that some anomalous chemical reactions might be producing the heat .
One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements .
Typically the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt .
One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells .
A cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it reported Turgut M. Gur an associate of materials scientist Robert A. Huggins head of the Stanford experimental team .
One of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist John Bockris of Texas A&M University .
Mr. Bockris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water .
He said that within the past few days he 's gotten evidence that there is a weak correlation between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium .
There is n't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water so it 's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon .
Increasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions continue to be negative .
Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable .
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque N.M. reported they went so far as to take a cold fusion experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays .
A number of times they detected neutrons in one sometimes two of the three detectors but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors and they think that was a spurious event .
Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it .
In subsequent experiments one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time .
They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment .
At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted reported Philip Ross from the California laboratory .
Dow Jones & Co. announced Wall Street Journal advertising rates for 1990 .
The rates which take effect Jan. 2 include a 4 % increase for national edition advertising .
The Journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts .
The increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a 6.5 % increase in 1989 .
Newsprint and postage prices this year have not gone up said Peter R. Kann president of Dow Jones .
We have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without substantially increasing our costs .
Fundamental fairness and a sense of responsibility lead us to share operating efficiencies with our customers .
Advertising rates for the Eastern Midwest Western and Southwest editions will increase an average 5.5 % and rates for localized advertising editions will increase 7.5 % .
Rates for the Wall Street Journal Reports will remain unchanged .
A one-time noncontract full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal national edition will cost 99,385 .
Advertising rates for The Wall Street Journal\/Europe published in Brussels and printed in the Netherlands and Switzerland will increase 9 % .
Rates for The Asian Wall Street Journal published and printed in Hong Kong and also printed in Singapore and Tokyo will rise 8 % .
Rates for The Asian Wall Street Journal Weekly published in New York for North American readers will rise 6 % .
Dow Jones also publishes Barron 's magazine other periodicals and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services .
It owns 67 % of Telerate Inc. a leading supplier of computerized financial information on global markets .
Reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending Texas Instruments Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 31 % and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier .
Net fell to 65 million or 67 cents a common share from 93.7 million or 1.03 a share a year ago .
Sales fell 2.5 % to 1.54 billion from 1.58 billion .
For the nine months the electronics and defense concern had net of 255.8 million or 2.70 a share down 5.6 % from 271 million or 3.01 a share in the year-ago period .
Sales were 4.66 billion up 1.3 % from 4.6 billion .
Jerry Junkins chairman president and chief executive officer said sluggish consumer-electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductors .
That coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher semiconductor-depreciation expense contributed to the decline in sales and profit .
In addition cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a 10 million charge to reduce the work force of Texas Instruments ' defense-electronics division also reduced net .
However the quarter results included 28 million in royalty income from patent licenses up from 21 million in the year-earlier period .
The nine months include 125 million of royalty income up from 98 million last year .
Mr. Junkins was n't optimistic about the short-term outlook hinting that further workforce reductions may be needed .
We expect near-term sluggishness in the electronics market he said and we will take ongoing cost-reduction actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand .
Further he said an internal reorganization to combine several divisions into the Information Technology Group is expected to affect fourth-quarter results by an undisclosed amount .
Lynch Corp. said its Lynch Telephone Corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of Western New Mexico Telephone Co. for 20 million plus assumption of 24 million of debt .
Western New Mexico Telephone Silver City had net income of 1.9 million on revenue of about 10 million last year .
It is an independent phone company with a service area of 15,000 square miles in southwest New Mexico .
It is also a partner in the wireline cellular franchise covering most of western New Mexico .
The transaction represents Lynch 's entry into the telephone business .
The company which has interests in television trucking services and glass-making and food-processing equipment said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry .
Nelson Bunker Hunt 's attempted corner on silver a decade ago is still haunting the market in this metal .
Silver now trading around 5 an ounce surged to an all-time peak of 50 an ounce in January 1980 from around 9 in mid-1979 .
Mr. Hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression says Lesley Edgar managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd. London bullion brokers .
While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use Mr. Edgar says .
Photographic developers for example bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs negatives and processing solutions .
Meanwhile the photographic industry which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption continues to look for substitutes .
Japanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require silver dealers say .
Silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors dealers say .
Even in the present uncertain investment climate investors are preferring quality assets such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold silver and platinum dealers say .
Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation dealers say .
Silver however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum .
Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s .
Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals says Frederick R. Demler analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
A further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the U.S. he says .
Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union .
Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico Mr. Demler says .
Meanwhile total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row he says .
Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces .
Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance Mr. Demler says .
Despite intermittent rallies in the past few years improvements in the supply-demand balance have n't managed to push silver prices into a higher range .
There 's just too much silver around says Tom Butler an analyst at Samuel Montagu & Co. a London bullion house .
A huge silver stockpile at exchanges refiners consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report .
This year alone inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces because of producer deliveries de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors says Rhona O'Connell London-based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton .
Silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend Ms. O'Connell says .
Moreover while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price silver does n't have the same mystique dealers say .
Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold says Urs Seiler senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland .
Yet if gold prices improve silver prices could rally sharply he says .
However dealers caution that any increase would be 1 to 2 at most .
Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week Livestock and Meats Analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found fewer-than-expected cattle on feedlots .
After the close of trading Friday the Agriculture Department reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8.06 million cattle on Oct. 1 down 6 % from that date a year earlier .
Most analysts had expected the government to report a 4 % decline .
Feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef .
The government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5 % compared with the year-earlier quarter .
Many industry analysts had been projecting a 3 % decline in placements for the quarter .
In the 1988 quarter many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches .
The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable .
A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy .
The Agriculture Department also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered in the quarter dropped by 5 % from the 1988 quarter which was in line with projections by analysts .
Energy Friday 's 44-cent-a-barrel price drop to 19.98 in the expiring November contract for West Texas Intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board .
Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions .
Barring any petroleum-related news events trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm .
Copper Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon .
For example copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at 1.2345 a pound .
Pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes .
On Friday one analyst said rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia .
In Mexico the analyst added employees at the Cananea mine who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force .
The mine is expected to return to production in about a week .
On Friday selling dominated the afternoon curb session in London which takes place at noon EDT .
The premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed indicating weaker demand for cash copper .
Long-term support for the December contract was believed to be at 1.25 a pound .
A technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it .
That brought in considerable fund selling which continued until the close of trading .
In general it was a bearish close said Ben Hanauer a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co. a major commodities trading and brokerage firm .
But whether this price break has implications for this week he said we will know more when the London Metal Exchange copper stock levels are released Monday morning .
Another analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued .
Bernard Savaiko senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. said that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks they perceived a bearish sign .
He also noted that the Japanese who had been buying at prices just above the 1.25 level apparently pulled back from the market on Friday .
Mr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to 1.05 a pound .
Hewlett-Packard Co. will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other .
Called Task Broker the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together .
If a machine has a big computing task Task Broker asks other computers in the network for bids on the job .
It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine .
Hewlett-Packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast .
The new Hewlett-Packard program said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc. a computer-market research company is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing .
In today 's computer networks some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed .
With the Hewlett-Packard program he said You get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers .
The program which will be shipped in January 1990 runs on the Unix operating system .
Hewlett-Packard will charge 5,000 for a license covering 10 users .
The program now works on all Hewlett-Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford Conn .
Hewlett-Packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines .
The Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network .
A previously available program called Network Computing System developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division for instance takes a task and splits it up into parts divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing .
But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system .
Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker Hewlett-Packard said and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work .
The Task Broker turns that network into as far as the user is concerned one giant computer said Bill Kay general manager of Hewlett-Packard 's workstation group .
Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys the franchisees .
When elephants start fighting ants get killed says Murray Riese co-owner of National Restaurants a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut Roy Rogers and other chains .
As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another franchisers are struggling desperately for market share slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions .
The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees .
The chains used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow but in the last year or so discounting has become a 12-month thing says Donald Harty president of Charisma Group Inc. a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain .
Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year Mr. Harty says profits will be flat or lower .
And Bill Konopnicki a Safford Ariz. licensee of McDonald 's Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory Board says some fast-food outlets could be in serious trouble based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on .
Until recently the huge fast-food industry with sales of about 60.1 billion last year kept price-skirmishing to a minimum .
But early this year PepsiCo Inc. 's Taco Bell unit and Wendy 's International Inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions says John Rohs an analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Co .
That brought a chain reaction in the industry .
The situation was further aggravated early this month when McDonald 's set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons .
It also decided to go national with pizza which it has been test-marketing .
Now two-for-one deals on pizza are common so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high .
The discounting say fast-food operators occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before .
The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even laying off middle managers and working harder to make less .
Joe Mack a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. a Burger King operator in Omaha Neb. says discounting is so prevalent that we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers to keep sales level .
It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food he says .
Alan D'Agosto president of Panda 's Inc. an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha says All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming but we are n't increasing sales .
With fast-food outlets on every corner he like many does n't think he has a choice in the price war Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon .
If the battle continues much longer many fast-food businesses will close or merge predicts Vincent Morrissey who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest .
The industry is overbuilt he says .
Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available .
The National Restaurant Association says quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 the last year for which figures are available .
With the market so crowded says a spokesman for Wendy 's in Columbus Ohio If you 're doing well you 're doing well at someone else 's expense .
Simply put there is n't enough business for every store to grow .
According to Mr. Rohs inflation-adjusted same-store sales at company-owned Wendy 's units in the U.S. have trailed year-earlier levels throughout 1989 except for August .
McDonald 's has also been running negative all year the analyst says .
Spokesmen for Wendy 's and McDonald 's criticized Mr. Rohs 's calculations .
Jack Greenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald '
