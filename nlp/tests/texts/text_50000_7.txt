a portfolio .
In a nutshell pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in defensive industries .
A heavy dose of cash is prescribed along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds preferably government bonds .
It 's tempting to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand .
But that may not be possible because recessions often take investors by surprise .
They always seem to come a bit later than you expect .
When they do hit they hit fast says David A. Wyss chief financial economist at the Data Resources division of McGraw-Hill Inc .
Though he himself does n't expect a recession soon Mr. Wyss advises people who do that the best thing to be in is long that is 20-year to 30-year Treasury bonds .
The reason is simple Mr. Wyss says Interest rates almost always decline during recession .
As surely as a seesaw tilts falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds .
They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do .
That effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds .
But short-term bonds ca n't rise too much because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon .
Long-term bonds with many years left before maturity swing more widely in price .
But not just any bonds will do .
Corporate bonds are usually not a good bet in a recession Mr. Wyss says .
As times get tougher investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts .
This hurts the price of corporate bonds .
Also he notes most corporate bonds are callable .
That means that a corporation after a specified amount of time has passed can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value plus in some cases a sweetener .
When interest rates have dropped it makes sense for corporations to do just that they then save on interest costs .
But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny .
If corporate bonds are bad in recessions junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all .
It 's an absolute necessity to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing says Avner Arbel professor of finance at Cornell University .
Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside and this could be a disaster .
Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government .
During an economic slump local tax revenues often go down raising the risks associated with at least some municipals .
And like corporates many municipal bonds are callable .
But a few experts going against the consensus do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing .
One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co. a brokerage house in Houston who thinks that we 're either in a recession or about to go into one .
What 's more he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual Once the downturn comes it 's going to be very hard to reverse .
Investors he advises should be cautious holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds .
Because he sees a 5 % to 6 % base rate of inflation in the economy he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon .
Instead Mr. Beach says investors probably should be carrying a very high level of cash by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills .
Greg Confair president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown Pa. also recommends that investors go heavily for cash .
He is n't sure a recession is coming but says the other likely alternative reignited inflation is just as bad .
This late in an expansion the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession Mr. Confair says .
The Federal Reserve Board 's plan for a soft landing he says requires the Fed to navigate an ever-narrowing corridor .
A soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all Mr. Confair adds .
It has to be engineered over and over again month after month .
He believes that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw .
And in a sense that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios .
It comes down to a question of whether to try to time the market .
For people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad stocks have been rewarding long-term investments .
Most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9 % to 10 % including both dividends and price appreciation .
That 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid .
Moreover because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing .
Trying to time the economy is a mistake says David Katz chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York .
Mr. Katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years .
Investors who listened and lightened up on stocks have just hurt themselves he says .
Mr. Katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70 % of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy .
Frequent trading runs up high commission costs .
And the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time .
Still few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming .
After all in all five recessions since 1960 stocks declined .
According to Ned Davis president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis Fla. the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21 % and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started .
By the time a recession is official two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product much of the damage to stocks has already been done and in the typical case the recession is already half over .
About six months before a recession ends stocks typically begin to rise again as investors anticipate a recovery .
The average recession lasts about a year .
Unfortunately though recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't reliably be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases .
But whatever their advice about timing none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession .
For the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks professionals have a number of suggestions .
Mr. Katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios that is low prices in relation to the company 's earnings per share .
Low P-E stocks he says vastly outperform others during a recession or bear market .
In good times he says they lag a bit but overall they provide superior performance .
Prof. Arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small companies .
Small-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession he says .
And in any case he argues stocks of small companies are almost as overpriced as they were Sept. 30 1987 just before the crash .
For example Mr. Arbel says stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow .
Cash flow basically earnings plus depreciation is one common gauge of a company 's financial health .
That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash Mr. Arbel says .
And it 's way above the ratio 7.5 times cash flow that bigger companies are selling for .
Another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in defensive industries .
Food tobacco drugs and utilities are the classic examples .
Recession or not people still eat smoke and take medicine when they 're sick .
George Putnam III editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston offers one final tip for recession-wary investors .
Keep some money available for opportunities he says .
If the recession does hit there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest .
Mr. Dorfman covers investing issues from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau .
Some industry groups consistently weather the storm better than others .
The following shows the number of times these industries outperformed the Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index during the first six months of the past seven recessions .
Bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt .
But while the overall market improved the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count casualties even as junk-bond prices rose .
Yesterday Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it postponed a 220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by York International Corp .
And Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a 475 million debenture offering by Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. that was still being negotiated late last night .
The issue by Chicago & North Western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar .
Some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk .
Since last week 's junk-bond market debacle many new issues of high-yield high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back delayed or dropped .
On Wednesday Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines ' junk-bond offering to 71 million from 150 million .
Salomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co. 's 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction .
Last week the Grand Union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock .
Prudential-Bache said the York issue was delayed because of market conditions .
Everything is going through firehoops right now and Chicago & North Western is no exception said Mariel Clemensen vice president high-yield research at Citicorp .
Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals .
Dan Baldwin managing director of high-yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management said the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured in part because several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package .
If you 're going to take the risk in this market you want something extra .
Mr. Baldwin likes the offering .
But several mutual-fund managers nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class .
While they consider the Chicago & North Western issue to be good they do n't view it as the best .
To lure buyers to the Chicago & North Western bonds portfolio managers said Donaldson Lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10 % equity kicker .
The bonds are expected to have a 14 1\/2 % coupon rate .
The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10 % of the stock of CNW Corp. Chicago & North Western 's parent company .
Donaldson Lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring .
According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations the 10 % of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank Blackstone Group which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5 % each .
That would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60 % stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15 % .
Despite the problems with new issues high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary or resell market .
Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership rising one point .
In the Treasury market the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point or 8.75 for each 1,000 face amount .
The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows .
That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower .
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2 % last month slightly lower than some economists had expected .
But there were also rumors yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term Treasurys .
Short-term Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher .
Yesterday the Fed executed four-day matched sales a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system .
The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the Fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 3\/4 % at which it has been hovering around during the past week .
The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans .
It is considered an early signal of Fed credit policy changes .
The fact that they did four-day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively .
They are telling us that 8 3\/4 % is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate said Robert Chandross at Lloyds Bank PLC .
Treasury Securities The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 25\/32 to yield 7.955 % compared with 100 29\/32 to yield 8.032 % Wednesday .
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 9\/32 to yield 7.937 % compared with 99 26\/32 to yield 8.007 % .
Short-term rates rose yesterday .
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % .
Meanwhile the Treasury sold 9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday .
The average yield on the bills was 7.35 % down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21 .
Yesterday 's yield was the lowest since 7.22 % on July 27 .
Here are details of the auction Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it .
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year .
Corporate Issues Junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities .
Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1\/4 to 1\/2 point with so-called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one-point gains .
Petrolane Gas Service 's 13 1\/4 % debentures traded at 102 after trading around par earlier this week and RJR 's 13 1\/2 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5\/8 after trading at below par earlier this week .
Investment-grade bonds were unchanged .
Municipals Activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector .
Traders estimated that more than 140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers .
There was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios .
According to market participants the bonds were met with decent bids but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield .
Away from the general obligation sector activity was modest .
Long dollar bonds were flat to up 3\/8 point .
New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was up 3\/8 at 98 3\/8 bid to yield about 7.32 % down 0.03 percentage point .
The debt of some California issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday 's massive earthquake although traders said market participants remained cautious .
California expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its 1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated 500 million to 1 billion in damages resulting from the quake according to a state official .
It 's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve said Cindy Katz assistant director of California 's department of finance although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated .
Meanwhile new issuance was slow .
The largest sale in the competitive arena was a 55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority .
A balance of 25.8 million remained in late order-taking according to the lead manager .
Mortgage-Backed Securities Mortgage securities generally ended 6\/32 to 9\/32 point higher but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts .
Premium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon rates of 13 % and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by Congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages .
Ginnie Mae 13 % securities were down about 1\/4 at 109 30\/32 .
If the refinancing plan clears Congress there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities hurting any investor paying much above par for them .
In the current-coupon sector a shift in the Treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings .
Ginnie Mae 9 % securities ended at 98 6\/32 up 9\/32 and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 % securities were at 97 10\/32 up 6\/32 .
The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 9.42 % to a 12-year average life assumption as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48 .
While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the Treasury yield curve underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable .
Two new Remics totaling 900 million were announced by Freddie Mac yesterday .
Foreign Bonds British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson .
The Treasury 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 was down 2\/32 at 111 29\/32 to yield 10.09 % while the 11 3\/4 % notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 19\/32 to yield 12.94 % .
In Japan the bellwether No. 111 4.6 % bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72 to yield 5.32 % and in West Germany the 7 % benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02 % .
THE PANHANDLER approaches makes his pitch .
It may be straightforward he wants money for food or incredibly convoluted his sister is at this very moment near death in Hoboken he has lost his wallet and has only 1.22 in change to put toward a bus ticket costing 3.83 and wo n't you give him the difference .
No .
Well how about a loan he 'll take your name and address Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this .
But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer famine child abuse or what have you .
Most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals .
But will it .
In a distressing number of cases no .
In fact the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler at least he has no overhead and he might even be telling the truth .
Last year more than 100 billion was donated to the nation 's 400,000 charities .
While the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for it 's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in expenses claimed by other operators including fraudulent expenses .
In many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries .
It 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs high-living operators and downright fraud .
But the problem clearly is widespread and persistent .
State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging .
The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year measuring them against minimum standards for accountability for accuracy and honesty in solicitation and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established .
The Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program .
Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test .
Which it should be added does n't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway .
Without a microscope and a subpoena it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself .
On this basis there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one says David Ormstedt an assistant attorney general in Connecticut .
A lot of donors just get taken .
Including those he contends who put about 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center .
The state has sued these charities in state court complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent 82 % says Mr. Ormstedt went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives for fur coats trips to Florida Lucullan restaurant tabs .
The telephone number for the charity in Shelton Conn. has been disconnected and the former officials could n't be located .
Running a charity does cost money but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed .
The Arthritis Foundation the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90 % of their income on programs not overhead .
With some other charities however it s the other way around .
The fledgling National Children 's Cancer Society for example took in 2.5 million last year to finance bone-marrow transplants for children .
By the time it paid its expenses it only had 120,000 left not enough to treat even one child .
The state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago along with Telesystems Marketing Inc. its Houston-based fund raiser .
Both deny wrongdoing .
The charity admits spending a lot on fund raising but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come .
Michael Burns president of Telesystems says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children 's .
Meanwhile a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds .
Enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising .
State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income usually half that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court .
It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression .
This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently .
The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere .
In making cases the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers .
Illinois for instance currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there .
Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give .
Attorneys general in several states including Illinois are already suing Watson & Hughey Co. an Alexandria Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America .
According to the Illinois attorney general 's suit Watson & Hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes and could win up to an additional 1,000 on top of them if they contributed as little as 7 .
But the total value of the prizes was only 5,000 and most winners will receive just 10 cents according to the attorney general 's office .
The suit is still pending in Illinois state court .
Watson & Hughey has denied the allegations in court officials decline to comment further .
While they can target some of the most obvious miscreants enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface .
There are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious operators they say that it is probably impossible to stop them all .
One maneuver the public education gambit .
The solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue .
What it does n't say is that the entire campaign may be the fund-raising letter itself .
All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as Do n't smoke .
or Wear suntan lotion ' says William Webster attorney general of Missouri .
By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters .
Mr. Webster cites a four-page mailing from the United Cancer Council that offers a chance to win 5,000 in gold bullion to those giving as little as 5 to cancer education .
A few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages .
I think some people may believe they 're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters he says .
Officials at the Washington D.C.-based charity did n't return repeated phone calls .
Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs .
The established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it .
We ca n't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name .
Most of them do n't last for long but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they are n't connected with us says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association .
And sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it .
A couple in Rockford Ill. raised 12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving without permission from the group .
MADD did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for 613 along with a letter saying that was the charity 's share .
The Illinois Attorney General won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without MADD 's permission .
The couple could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left Rockford law enforcement officials report .
Denise McDonald a spokeswoman for MADD says It 's scary because anybody could do this .
Mr. Johnson is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Chicago bureau .
Overhead costs at some of the largest charities in millions of dollars British Airways PLC a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp. washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of United Airlines .
Specifically the British carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for UAL .
In addition British Air officially withdrew its support for the previous 300-a-share bid in a terse statement that said the original deal is closed .
Company officials said later that British Airways believes its involvement in the UAL buy-out ended last Friday when the buy-out group which also includes UAL 's management and pilot union failed to obtain financing for the 6.79 billion transaction .
The carrier stopped short of saying it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for UAL .
However company officials said they plan to take no initiatives to resurrect the transaction and are n't aware of any restructured bid in the making .
Collectively the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for UAL will ever get off the ground .
The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last Friday with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place .
However in response to the British Air decision United 's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out .
Pilot union Chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky said advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL 's board at the earliest time possible .
Pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without British Air 's participation .
UAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement .
UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf who is leading the management end of the buy-out has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal .
In another setback yesterday United 's machinist union asked the Treasury Department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws .
In an effort to derail the buy-out the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission Transportation Department and Labor Department .
But there was one bright spot yesterday .
The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake .
The pilot union the only one to support the buy-out thus far said the flight attendants ' decision enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable .
Still without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid .
Under the previous plan British Air would have received a 15 % stake in UAL in exchange for a 750 million equity investment with a 75 % stake going to UAL employees and 10 % to UAL management .
British Air officials said the airline 's chairman Lord King was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier .
The previous reports were based on remarks by British Air 's chief financial officer Derek Stevens who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL 's stock in the past week .
UAL stock dropped 1.625 yesterday to 190.125 on volume of 923,500 shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
UAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement .
In an interview Wednesday with Dow Jones Professional Investor Report Mr. Stevens said We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all .
We 're not rushing into anything .
We do n't want to be party to a second rejection .
Indeed British Air seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment .
The original transaction fell through on the same day British Air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the British succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution .
The carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its American counterparts .
The buy-out consortium ceased to exist because our American partners were not capable of organizing the financing a British Air spokesman said .
British Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the Transportation Department forced Northwest 's Airlines ' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in that carrier .
Most of the department 's statements since the Northwest transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in U.S. carriers .
Even before British Air 's announcement pilot union leaders had been meeting in Chicago yesterday to consider their options .
The leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing Wednesday by the union 's advisers Lazard Freres & Co. and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .
They also unanimously re-elected Mr. Dubinsky the union chairman who has led the pilots ' 2 1\/2-year fight to take control of the airline .
UAL 's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid .
They have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction .
The buy-out fell through after Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. the lead banks in the transaction failed to obtain 7.2 billion in financing needed for the plan .
Italy 's industrial wholesale sales index rose 13.2 % in June from a year earlier the state statistical institute Istat said .
The June increase compared with a rise of 10.5 % in May from a year earlier .
Domestic wholesale sales rose 11.9 % from a year earlier while foreign sales jumped 17.3 % Istat said .
For the first six months wholesale sales rose 12.3 % from the year before reflecting to a 11.5 % jump in domestic sales and a 14.6 % boost in foreign sales .
Sales of capital goods to foreign and domestic destinations increased 16.6 % in the January-June period from a year earlier .
Sales of consumer goods rose 6.9 % in the same period while sales of intermediate goods were up 13.8 % from a year ago .
Senate Democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided under pressure from their leaders not to offer their own proposal placing another obstacle in the path of President Bush 's legislative priority .
A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets .
The plan was complete except for finishing touches and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday .
But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell D. Maine a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday .
Sen. Mitchell urged them to desist .
Afterward leaders of the dissident Democrats relented and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned .
The decision is a setback for President Bush who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled Senate .
Having a proposal sponsored by Democrats would have given the president an advantage .
Having only a Republican measure makes the task harder .
Still Sen. Bob Packwood R. Ore. the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year .
He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect .
But Sen. Mitchell buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats strongly disagreed .
Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year .
Yesterday in an interview he added that the Democrats ' decision increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year .
Mr. Mitchell 's first victory came last week when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision .
That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators .
The House version of the bill does include the tax cut .
Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation .
To help lay the groundwork for that fight President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue .
The president apparently will have only one bill to push Sen. Packwood 's and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it .
I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor said Sen. David Boren D. Okla. a leader of those Democrats .
The Packwood plan as expected would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year .
The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35 % after seven years .
The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 .
As an alternative taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index .
For corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % .
That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years .
The Packwood plan also would include a proposal designed by Sen. William Roth R. Del. that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts .
The Roth plan would create a new non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home education expenses and medical expenses .
Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax though no penalty .
Westmoreland Coal Co. realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity reported sharply improved third-quarter results .
The producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said net income for the quarter was 5.9 million or 71 cents a share on revenue of 145.4 million .
For the year-earlier period the company reported a loss of 520,000 or six cents a share .
In the latest nine months the company earned 8.5 million or 1.03 a share .
Last year 's net loss of 3,524,000 included a benefit of 1,640,000 from an accounting change .
Revenue for the nine months rose to 449 million from 441.1 million .
In an interview Pemberton Hutchinson president and chief executive cited several reasons for the improvement higher employee productivity and good natural conditions in the mines as well as lower costs for materials administrative overhead and debt interest .
In the latest nine months Mr. Hutchinson said total coal sales rose to about 14.6 million tons from about 14.3 million tons a year earlier .
In addition long-term debt has been trimmed to about 72 million from 96 million since Jan. 1 .
He predicted the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters .
Westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region .
The operating territory includes coal terminals on the Ohio River and in Newport News Va .
Westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas .
For the past couple of years Westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business .
Marginal operations and assets have been sold .
The size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 .
About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated .
Even perks have been reduced .
For example the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits the company used to pay 100 % .
I think the ship is now righted the bilges are pumped and we are on course Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program .
Much of what we set out to do is completed .
But he cautioned that Westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth so investors should n't just multiply the third quarter by four and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained .
One difference he said is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season .
I do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now he said .
We have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient .
It 's a process that never really ends .
Nevertheless Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be solidly profitable for Westmoreland and that 1990 would bring more of the same .
For all of 1988 the company reported an after-tax operating loss of 134,000 on revenue of 593.5 million .
An accounting adjustment made net income 1.5 million or 18 cents a share .
In a move that complements the company 's basic strategy its Westmoreland Energy Inc. unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in Virginia .
Some of the coal the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines .
Mr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s will be exciting .
He said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the Mississippi River .
Westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s .
We see coal 's piece of the action growing Mr. Hutchinson said .
Coal prices while not skyrocketing will grow modestly in real terms we think .
Chase Manhattan Corp. after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower Manhattan operations building has exercised its option to purchase the 50-story office tower .
Chase had purchased an option to buy the building at One New York Plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late Sol Atlas as part of its original lease in 1970 .
The current transaction cost the bank approximately 140 million .
Of that amount 20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself .
The building houses about 4,500 Chase workers most of whom will be moved to downtown Brooklyn after the bank 's new back office center is completed in 1993 .
The move is part of Chase 's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof .
The headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza .
As part of its decision to leave the building Chase tried to sell its interest along with the Atlas estate 's interest shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash .
Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations .
He said Chase and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for 400 million to 475 million but did n't get an offer for more than 375 million .
As the building 's new owner Chase will have its work cut out for it .
Chase is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space and Salomon Brothers Inc. whose headquarters is in the building also plans to move shortly .
In addition another major building tenant Thomson McKinnon Inc. 's Thomson McKinnon Securities likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation .
New York real estate brokerage Edward S. Gordon Co. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants .
Even with its striking views of the New York harbor the building is considered antiquated by modern office standards .
And Chase will have to spend approximately 50 million to remove asbestos from the premises .
WALL STREET SHAKE hands with George Orwell .
The author of the futuristic novel 1984 invented a language called Newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought that is anything negative about the policies and practices of the state .
Wall Street has n't gotten that far yet but it has made a promising start .
Its language call it Streetspeak is increasingly mellifluous reassuring and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better safer or cheaper than they really are .
When something undeniably nasty happens a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers .
For example we 'll bet you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago .
Wrong .
According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market it never happened .
In their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19 1987 was just a big blip .
Trotting out a much-beloved Streetspeak term New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan recently declared that history would record the event as only a major technical correction .
Another much-beloved saying however this one in plain English holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it is a duck .
On Oct. 29 1929 a date historians stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded C-word the DJ industrials fell 12.8 % .
In the technical correction of two years ago they lost a whopping 22.6 % .
Customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock .
These people used to be called brokers but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction when terrified customers could n't raise brokers on the phone .
Either way the word broker is clearly out of favor .
Of the major New York-based securities firms only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers .
At Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. they are financial consultants .
At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Prudential Bache Securities and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. they are account executives .
At PaineWebber Inc. they are investment executives .
Such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified broad-scale competence and expertise in selling today 's myriad financial products .
It is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up for them to peddle do n't feel .
It s almost product de jour grouses one account executive at Dean Witter .
The transmogrified brokers never let the C-word cross their lips instead stressing such terms as safe insured and guaranteed even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product .
The names of some of these products do n't suggest the risk involved in buying them either .
A case in point government-plus bond funds .
What could imply more safety than investing in government bonds .
What could be better than getting a tad more income from them the plus than other people .
Indeed conservative investors many of them elderly have poured more than 50 billion into such funds which promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options a gambler 's game .
When a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker .
This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments .
They are still being sold but more and more often as direct investments with all the same risks they had under the old label .
In such cases the game has n't changed only the name .
In others a familiar old name still prevails but the underlying game has changed .
For example no load mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a frontend sales commission .
Getting out of them however may be a different story now .
Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee usually a modest one they imposed no other fees and many still do n't .
In recent years though a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges all the way up to 6 % when an investor sells his shares .
Should n't they properly be called exit-load funds .
The mutual-fund industry is debating the question but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well .
And do n't expect anyone to change the term blue chip either even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for one is still a favorite of widows orphans and trust departments but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture .
Also blue chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent years .
Larry Biehl a money manager in San Mateo Calif. blames that on the advent of program trading in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail .
Blue chips he says are now being
