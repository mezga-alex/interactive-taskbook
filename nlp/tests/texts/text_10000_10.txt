s which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions continue to be negative .
Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable .
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque N.M. reported they went so far as to take a cold fusion experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays .
A number of times they detected neutrons in one sometimes two of the three detectors but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors and they think that was a spurious event .
Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it .
In subsequent experiments one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time .
They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment .
At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted reported Philip Ross from the California laboratory .

Reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending Texas Instruments Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 31 % and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier .
Net fell to 65 million or 67 cents a common share from 93.7 million or 1.03 a share a year ago .
Sales fell 2.5 % to 1.54 billion from 1.58 billion .
For the nine months the electronics and defense concern had net of 255.8 million or 2.70 a share down 5.6 % from 271 million or 3.01 a share in the year-ago period .
Sales were 4.66 billion up 1.3 % from 4.6 billion .
Jerry Junkins chairman president and chief executive officer said sluggish consumer-electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductors .
That coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher semiconductor-depreciation expense contributed to the decline in sales and profit .
In addition cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a 10 million charge to reduce the work force of Texas Instruments ' defense-electronics division also reduced net .
However the quarter results included 28 million in royalty income from patent licenses up from 21 million in the year-earlier period .
The nine months include 125 million of royalty income up from 98 million last year .
Mr. Junkins was n't optimistic about the short-term outlook hinting that further workforce reductions may be needed .
We expect near-term sluggishness in the electronics market he said and we will take ongoing cost-reduction actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand .
Further he said an internal reorganization to combine several divisions into the Information Technology Group is expected to affect fourth-quarter results by an undisclosed amount .
Lynch Corp. said its Lynch Telephone Corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of Western New Mexico Telephone Co. for 20 million plus assumption of 24 million of debt .
Western New Mexico Telephone Silver City had net income of 1.9 million on revenue of about 10 million last year .
It is an independent phone company with a service area of 15,000 square miles in southwest New Mexico .
It is also a partner in the wireline cellular franchise covering most of western New Mexico .
The transaction represents Lynch 's entry into the telephone business .
The company which has interests in television trucking services and glass-making and food-processing equipment said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry .
Nelson Bunker Hunt 's attempted corner on silver a decade ago is still haunting the market in this metal .
Silver now trading around 5 an ounce surged to an all-time peak of 50 an ounce in January 1980 from around 9 in mid-1979 .
Mr. Hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression says Lesley Edgar managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd. London bullion brokers .
While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use Mr. Edgar says .
Photographic developers for example bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs negatives and processing solutions .
Meanwhile the photographic industry which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption continues to look for substitutes .
Japanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require silver dealers say .
Silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors dealers say .
Even in the present uncertain investment climate investors are preferring quality assets such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold silver and platinum dealers say .
Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation dealers say .
Silver however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum .
Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s .
Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals says Frederick R. Demler analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
A further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the U.S. he says .
Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union .
Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico Mr. Demler says .
Meanwhile total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row he says .
Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces .
Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance Mr. Demler says .
Despite intermittent rallies in the past few years improvements in the supply-demand balance have n't managed to push silver prices into a higher range .
There 's just too much silver around says Tom Butler an analyst at Samuel Montagu & Co. a London bullion house .
A huge silver stockpile at exchanges refiners consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report .
This year alone inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces because of producer deliveries de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors says Rhona O'Connell London-based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton .
Silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend Ms. O'Connell says .
Moreover while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price silver does n't have the same mystique dealers say .
Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold says Urs Seiler senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland .
Yet if gold prices improve silver prices could rally sharply he says .
However dealers caution that any increase would be 1 to 2 at most .
Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week Livestock and Meats Analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found fewer-than-expected cattle on feedlots .
