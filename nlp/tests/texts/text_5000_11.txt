a 98 % of the bank but with the understanding that Mr. Ty had repurchase rights .
His ability to match any bid has scared off many potential buyers .
Separately the government will try again within a month to sell the 36 % stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines or Picop as the paper mill is known .
The price will depend on how much Picop shares fetch on the local stock market .
But according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill price is n't the only consideration .
As it stands now the government would continue to hold 45 % of Picop after the 36 % stake is sold .
About 7.5 % of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity .
Potential buyers mostly foreign companies are reluctant to take a non-controlling stake in a company that by the government 's own reckoning needs some 100 million in new capital for rehabilitation .
The prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers including a member of the Elders group of Australia to pull out of the bidding the bankers and analysts say .
Mr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer .
Under government regulations however foreign ownership of Picop 's equity is limited to 40 % .
Even though the government would retain the 45 % stake in Picop critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners .
A series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short-changing the government over the Picop sale .
Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale both prompted by the criticism of the agency .
The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines in which it has a 99 % stake .
The carrier has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed .
