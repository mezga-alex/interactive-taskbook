In East Germany where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism they 're not laughing about their new leader Egon Krenz .
Mr. Krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him .

I hope he grows with the job says Rainer Eppelmann a Protestant pastor in East Berlin .
The most important thing is that he have
