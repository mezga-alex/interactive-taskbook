 Chairman Stephen M. Wolf who is leading the management end of the buy-out has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal .
In another setback yesterday United 's machinist union asked the Treasury Department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws .
In an effort to derail the buy-out the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission Transportation Department and Labor Department .
But there was one bright spot yesterday .
The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake .
The pilot union the only one to support the buy-out thus far said the flight attendants ' decision enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable .
Still without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid .
Under the previous plan British Air would have received a 15 % stake in UAL in exchange for a 750 million equity investment with a 75 % stake going to UAL employees and 10 % to UAL management .
British Air officials said the airline 's chairman Lord King was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier .
The previous reports were based on remarks by British Air 's chief financial officer Derek Stevens who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL 's stock in the past week .
UAL stock dropped 1.625 yesterday to 190.125 on volume of 923,500 shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
UAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement .
In an interview Wednesday with Dow Jones Professional Investor Report Mr. Stevens said We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all .
We 're not rushing into anything .
We do n't want to be party to a second rejection .
Indeed British Air seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment .
The original transaction fell through on the same day British Air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the British succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution .
The carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its American counterparts .
The buy-out consortium ceased to exist because our American partners were not capable of organizing the financing a British Air spokesman said .
British Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the Transportation Department forced Northwest 's Airlines ' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in that carrier .
Most of the department 's statements since the Northwest transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in U.S. carriers .
Even before British Air 's announcement pilot union leaders had been meeting in Chicago yesterday to consider their options .
The leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing Wednesday by the union 's advisers Lazard Freres & Co. and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .
They also unanimously re-elected Mr. Dubinsky the union chairman who has led the pilots ' 2 1\/2-year fight to take control of the airline .
UAL 's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid .
They have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction .
The buy-out fell through after Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. the lead banks in the transaction failed to obtain 7.2 billion in financing needed for the plan .
Italy 's industrial wholesale sales index rose 13.2 % in June from a year earlier the state statistical institute Istat said .
The June increase compared with a rise of 10.5 % in May from a year earlier .
Domestic wholesale sales rose 11.9 % from a year earlier while foreign sales jumped 17.3 % Istat said .
For the first six months wholesale sales rose 12.3 % from the year before reflecting to a 11.5 % jump in domestic sales and a 14.6 % boost in foreign sales .
Sales of capital goods to foreign and domestic destinations increased 16.6 % in the January-June period from a year earlier .
Sales of consumer goods rose 6.9 % in the same period while sales of intermediate goods were up 13.8 % from a year ago .
Senate Democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided under pressure from their leaders not to offer their own proposal placing another obstacle in the path of President Bush 's legislative priority .
A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets .
The plan was complete except for finishing touches and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday .
But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell D. Maine a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday .
Sen. Mitchell urged them to desist .
Afterward leaders of the dissident Democrats relented and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned .
The decision is a setback for President Bush who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled Senate .
Having a proposal sponsored by Democrats would have given the president an advantage .
Having only a Republican measure makes the task harder .
Still Sen. Bob Packwood R. Ore. the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year .
He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect .
But Sen. Mitchell buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats strongly disagreed .
Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year .
Yesterday in an interview he added that the Democrats ' decision increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year .
Mr. Mitchell 's first victory came last week when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision .
That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators .
The House version of the bill does include the tax cut .
Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation .
To help lay the groundwork for that fight President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue .
The president apparently will have only one bill to push Sen. Packwood 's and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it .
I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor said Sen. David Boren D. Okla. a leader of those Democrats .
The Packwood plan as expected would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year .
The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35 % after seven years .
The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 .
As an alternative taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index .
For corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % .
That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years .
The Packwood plan also would include a proposal designed by Sen. William Roth R. Del. that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts .
The Roth plan would create a new non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home education expenses and medical expenses .
Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax though no penalty .
Westmoreland Coal Co. realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity reported sharply improved third-quarter results .
The producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said net income for the quarter was 5.9 million or 71 cents a share on revenue of 145.4 million .
For the year-earlier period the company reported a loss of 520,000 or six cents a share .
In the latest nine months the company earned 8.5 million or 1.03 a share .
Last year 's net loss of 3,524,000 included a benefit of 1,640,000 from an accounting change .
Revenue for the nine months rose to 449 million from 441.1 million .
In an interview Pemberton Hutchinson president and chief executive cited several reasons for the improvement higher employee productivity and good natural conditions in the mines as well as lower costs for materials administrative overhead and debt interest .
In the latest nine months Mr. Hutchinson said total coal sales rose to about 14.6 million tons from about 14.3 million tons a year earlier .
In addition long-term debt has been trimmed to about 72 million from 96 million since Jan. 1 .
He predicted the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters .
Westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region .
The operating territory includes coal terminals on the Ohio River and in Newport News Va .
Westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas .
For the past couple of years Westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business .
Marginal operations and assets have been sold .
The size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 .
About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated .
Even perks have been reduced .
For example the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits the company used to pay 100 % .
I think the ship is now righted the bilges are pumped and we are on course Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program .
Much of what we set out to do is completed .
But he cautioned that Westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth so investors should n't just multiply the third quarter by four and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained .
One difference he said is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season .
I do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now he said .
We have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient .
It 's a process that never really ends .
Nevertheless Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be solidly profitable for Westmoreland and that 1990 would bring more of the same .
For all of 1988 the company reported an after-tax operating loss of 134,000 on revenue of 593.5 million .
An accounting adjustment made net income 1.5 million or 18 cents a share .
In a move that complements the company 's basic strategy its Westmoreland Energy Inc. unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in Virginia .
Some of the coal the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines .
Mr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s will be exciting .
He said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the Mississippi River .
Westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s .
We see coal 's piece of the action growing Mr. Hutchinson said .
Coal prices while not skyrocketing will grow modestly in real terms we think .
Chase Manhattan Corp. after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower Manhattan operations building has exercised its option to purchase the 50-story office tower .
Chase had purchased an option to buy the building at One New York Plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late Sol Atlas as part of its original lease in 1970 .
The current transaction cost the bank approximately 140 million .
Of that amount 20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself .
The building houses about 4,500 Chase workers most of whom will be moved to downtown Brooklyn after the bank 's new back office center is completed in 1993 .
The move is part of Chase 's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof .
The headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza .
As part of its decision to leave the building Chase tried to sell its interest along with the Atlas estate 's interest shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash .
Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations .
He said Chase and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for 400 million to 475 million but did n't get an offer for more than 375 million .
As the building 's new owner Chase will have its work cut out for it .
Chase is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space and Salomon Brothers Inc. whose headquarters is in the building also plans to move shortly .
In addition another major building tenant Thomson McKinnon Inc. 's Thomson McKinnon Securities likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation .
New York real estate brokerage Edward S. Gordon Co. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants .
Even with its striking views of the New York harbor the building is considered antiquated by modern office standards .
And Chase will have to spend approximately 50 million to remove asbestos from the premises .
WALL STREET SHAKE hands with George Orwell .
The author of the futuristic novel 1984 invented a language called Newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought that is anything negative about the policies and practices of the state .
Wall Street has n't gotten that far yet but it has made a promising start .
Its language call it Streetspeak is increasingly mellifluous reassuring and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better safer or cheaper than they really are .
When something undeniably nasty happens a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers .
For example we 'll bet you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago .
Wrong .
According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market it never happened .
In their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19 1987 was just a big blip .
Trotting out a much-beloved Streetspeak term New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan recently declared that history would record the event as only a major technical correction .
Another much-beloved saying however this one in plain English holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it is a duck .
On Oct. 29 1929 a date historians stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded C-word the DJ industrials fell 12.8 % .
In the technical correction of two years ago they lost a whopping 22.6 % .
Customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock .
These people used to be called brokers but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction when terrified customers could n't raise brokers on the phone .
Either way the word broker is clearly out of favor .
Of the major New York-based securities firms only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers .
At Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. they are financial consultants .
At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Prudential Bache Securities and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. they are account executives .
At PaineWebber Inc. they are investment executives .
Such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified broad-scale competence and expertise in selling today 's myriad financial products .
It is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up for them to peddle do n't feel .
It s almost product de jour grouses one account executive at Dean Witter .
The transmogrified brokers never let the C-word cross their lips instead stressing such terms as safe insured and guaranteed even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product .
The names of some of these products do n't suggest the risk involved in buying them either .
A case in point government-plus bond funds .
What could imply more safety than investing in government bonds .
What could be better than getting a tad more income from them the plus than other people .
Indeed conservative investors many of them elderly have poured more than 50 billion into such funds which promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options a gambler 's game .
When a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker .
This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments .
They are still being sold but more and more often as direct investments with all the same risks they had under the old label .
In such cases the game has n't changed only the name .
In others a familiar old name still prevails but the underlying game has changed .
For example no load mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a frontend sales commission .
Getting out of them however may be a different story now .
Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee usually a modest one they imposed no other fees and many still do n't .
In recent years though a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges all the way up to 6 % when an investor sells his shares .
Should n't they properly be called exit-load funds .
The mutual-fund industry is debating the question but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well .
And do n't expect anyone to change the term blue chip either even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for one is still a favorite of widows orphans and trust departments but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture .
Also blue chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent years .
Larry Biehl a money manager in San Mateo Calif. blames that on the advent of program trading in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail .
Blue chips he says are now being
