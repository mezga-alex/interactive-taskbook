All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology electronics or biotechnology and get out of mature basic industries Mr. Andersson recalls .
Yet under its 45-year-old president Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division later adding mining as well as building and construction materials .
