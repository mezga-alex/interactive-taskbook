Now television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny .
The IRS recently won part of its long-running battle with the Church of Scientology over exemptions when the U.S. Supreme Court held that members ' payments to the church were n't deductible because the members received services in return .
IRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers entertainment producers masons roofers and taxi owners .
Small businesses in general account for almost 40 % of unreported personal income the IRS has said .
Once such abuses become so pervasive the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them .
San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula not because IRS agents envy their life styles .
Many openings for mass cheating such as questionable tax shelters and home offices have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them .
Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals .
And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers .
Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony who gets a deduction must report the former spouse 's Social Security number .
Passport applicants now must give Social Security numbers enabling the IRS to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns .
But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention .
In most cases the IRS says these projects are local or regional rather than national and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among say factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses .
The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects according to Marshall V. Washburn deputy assistant commissioner for examination .
Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail but they can make life miserable in other ways for one by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence failure to file a return and the like .
The targeted audit groups include direct sellers people who sell cosmetics housewares and other items door to door or at home parties and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes .
Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips people who engage in large cash transactions and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax .
And now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return and which dependents turn out to be deceased .
Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back .
It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs Mr. Washburn says .
The study provided criteria for singling out returns of potentially noncompliant taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part-time business .
The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill N.J. who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields .
For 1984 they reported gross income of 1,647 from Amway sales offset by expenses totaling 16,746 including car costs of 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of 5,088 .
The Tax Court did n't believe that the Rubins who earned 65,619 in their regular jobs treated the sideline as a real business and derived merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits from it .
The Direct Selling Association a trade group points out that its members which include Amway Corp. cooperate with the IRS to distribute tax-compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject .
The independent-contractor project which began in 1988 involves about 350 IRS agents .
In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 reports Raymond P. Keenan assistant commissioner for collection they examined about 13,000 employers assessed more than 67 million in delinquent employment taxes and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors .
The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions mostly paid by small firms .
Many workers especially professionals want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees ca n't .
But many others who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation become tipsters for the IRS says Jerry Lackey who manages the IRS project 's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando .
Firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't he says .
In his area Mr. Lackey continues the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction doing framing drywall masonry and similar work .
But a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them including physicians and receptionists as independent contractors .
The IRS assessed the clinic 350,000 in back payroll taxes .
It assessed nearly 500,000 against a cruise-ship company that carried about 100 deckhands cooks bartenders entertainers and other employees as self-employed independents .
Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an 80 million computer system in 1985 .
The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses from exchange agreements with the IRS 24 other states and two Canadian provinces and even from phonebook Yellow Pages .
Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer they single out high-income groups looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns .
The state has combed through records relating to architects stockbrokers lawyers in the New York City area construction workers from out of the state and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states especially Florida which has no personal income tax .
Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state doctors dentists and accountants says Frederick G. Hicks director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs .
The department has collected over 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution .
In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns it squeezed 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident .
We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project Mr. Hicks declares .

In finding good news in Berkeley 's new freshman admissions plan The Privileged Class editorial Sept. 20 you 're reading the headline but not the story .
The plan indeed raises from 40 % to 50 % the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria .
But that does n't mean half of the students attending Berkeley will be admitted this way .
The plan is talking about applicants admitted not students who enroll .
Since the yield from this top slice of applicants is relatively low boosting admits from 40 % to 50 % will boost registrants from about 31 % to 38 % of the class .
In addition perhaps 5 % of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials narrowly missed gaining them admission in the first category .
But against that combined increase of 12 % in students chosen by academic criteria the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades test scores and supplemental points for factors such as high-school curriculum English-language proficiency and an essay .
This category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of registrants .
The plan thus will decrease by 22 % for a net loss of 10 % the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria .
Who will take over these places .
The plan creates a new category of students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds a concept not yet defined and gives them about 10 % of the class .
One of the plan 's authors has defended the socioeconomic disadvantage category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race .
Perhaps it does .
But the new category does not replace or reduce Berkeley 's broad racial preferences .
Nor will students from racial-minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative-action target for their group .
The plan thus places a large new affirmative-action program based on socioeconomic disadvantage on top of the existing program based on race .
The role of academic criteria in choosing Berkeley 's freshmen can only decline as a result .

FOR THOSE WHO DELIGHT in the misfortune of others read on .
This is a story about suckers .
Most of us know a sucker .
Many of us are suckers .
But what we may not know is just what makes somebody a sucker .
What makes people blurt out their credit-card numbers to a caller they 've never heard of .
Do they really believe that the number is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to being a grand-prize winner .
What makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door .
Or an interest in a retirement community in Nevada that will knock your socks off once it is built .
Because in the end these people always wind up asking themselves the same question How could I be so stupid .
There are unfortunately plenty of answers to that question and scam artists know all of them .
These people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person tick says Kent Neal chief of the economic-crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney 's Office in Fort Lauderdale Fla. a major haven for boiler rooms .
Once they size them up then they know what buttons to push .
John Blodgett agrees and he ought to know .
He used to be a boiler-room salesman peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins .
There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways he says .
The most obvious pitch of course is the lure of big returns .
We 're all a little greedy .
Everyone is vulnerable says Charles Harper associate regional administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Miami .
These guys prey on human frailties .
While the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells they often do n't in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore .
The overnight success story is part of our culture and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people says Michael Cunningham an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville .
Other people are making it overnight and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along .
Adds Spencer Barasch branch chief for enforcement at the SEC in Fort Worth Texas Why do people play the lottery when the odds are great against them .
People are shooting for a dream .
Clearly though scam artists have to be a bit more subtle than simply promising millions the psychology of suckers is n't simply the psychology of the greedy .
There 's also for instance the need to be part of the in-crowd .
So one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing .
Between 1978 and 1987 for instance SH Oil in Winter Haven Fla. sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents while turning away numerous other eager investors .
The owner of the company Stephen Smith who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office .
Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed the suit alleged .
Such schemes says Tony Adamski chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington D.C. appeal to investors ' desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity .
At times salesmen may embellish the inside information with the notion that this is some slightly shady slightly illegal investment the person is being included in says Mr. Cunningham .
In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others .
It also adds to the mystery of the venture .
Mr. Blodgett the boiler-room veteran believes that for many investors the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement .
Once people got into it I was allowing them to live a dream he says .
He phoned them with updates on the investment such as funny things that happened at the well that week he says .
You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives .
Mr. Blodgett who was convicted in Florida state court of selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive is now on probation .
He says he has quit the business and is back in school majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology .
For some investors it 's the appearances that leave them deceived .
The trappings of success go a long way wearing the right clothes doing the right things says Paul Andreassen an associate professor of psychology at Harvard .
Conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment .
People honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot he says .
Paul Wenz a Phoenix Ariz. attorney says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery .
But Mr. Wenz who says he lost 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and 39,000 in another says a salesman used a business-venture approach with him sending investment literature a contract limiting the firm 's liability and an insurance policy .
When he visited the company 's office he says it had all the trappings of legitimacy .
Still others are stung by a desire to do both well and good says Douglas Watson commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department 's bunko-forgery division .
Born-again Christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do-gooder investment pitches .
But hardly the only ones The scams promise among other things to help save the environment feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children .
Psychologists say isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud .
Scam artists seek out such people or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves .
For instance salesmen may counter a man 's objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking Who wears the pants in your family .
Or an investor who wants his accountant 's advice may be told You seem like a guy who can make up his own mind .
Often con artists will try to disarm their victims by emphasizing similarities between them .
William Lynes a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp. says he and his wife Lily warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from Stuart-James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them he too had once worked with Lockheed .
The Lyneses of Powder Springs Ga. have filed suit in Georgia state court against Stuart James alleging fraud .
They are awaiting an arbitration proceeding .
They say the broker took them out for lunch frequently .
He urged them to refer their friends who also lost money .
Donald Trinen an attorney for the penny-brokerage firm denies the fraud allegations and says the Lyneses were fully apprised that they were pursuing a high-risk investment .
It 's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to ingratiate themselves to their clients says Terree Bowers chief of the major-frauds section of the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles .
We 've seen cases where salesmen will affect the accent of the region of the country they are calling .
Anything to make a sale .
Experts say that whatever a person 's particular weak point timing is crucial .
People may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives .
Sometimes when people are making big changes retiring from their jobs moving to a new area they lose their bearings says Maury Elvekrog a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger-Elvekrog Inc. a Birmingham Mich. investment-counseling firm .
They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time .
They are obviously also more susceptible when they need money retirees for instance trying to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how to pay for a child 's college expenses .
These people are n't necessarily stupid or naive .
Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way says Jerald Jellison a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles .
Nick Cortese thinks that 's what happened to him .
Mr. Cortese a 33-year-old Delta Air Lines engineer invested some 2,000 in penny stocks through a broker who promised quick returns .
We were saving up to buy a house and my wife was pregnant says Mr. Cortese .
It was just before the Christmas holidays and I figured we could use some extra cash .
The investment is worth about 130 today .
Maybe it was just a vulnerable time says Mr. Cortese .
Maybe the next day or even an hour later I would n't have done it .

FOX HUNTING HAS been defined as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible but at least it 's exercise .
At least it has a little dash .
Most of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither drab duties rather than pleasures .
Like trying to buy life insurance for instance an endeavor notably lacking in dash .
Call it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible .
But sooner or later most of us have to think about life insurance just as we often have to think about having root-canal work .
And my time has come .
I 'm 33 married no children and employed in writing stories like this one .
In times past life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household meaning men but ours is a two-income family and accustomed to it .
So if anything happened to me I 'd want to leave behind enough so that my 33-year-old husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts though not I admit enough to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury .
Figuring that maybe 100,000 to 150,000 would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted I looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies and plunged into a jungle of gibberish .
Over the past decade or two while I was thinking about fox hunting the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products variations on products and variations on the variations .
Besides term life and whole life the old standbys we now have universal life universal variable life flexible adjustable universal life policies with persistency bonuses policies festooned with exotic riders living benefit policies and on and on .
What to do .
First generalize .
Shorn of all their riders special provisions and other bells and whistles insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories so-called pure insurance which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death and permanent insurance which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive .
If all you want is death-benefit coverage pure insurance a term policy gives you maximum bang for your buck within limits .
It 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age .
But term means just that the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires .
It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal if you flunk which means you need insurance more than ever you may not be able to buy it .
Even if you 're healthy and can renew your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older .
So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks .
There are all sorts of variations on term insurance policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt term riders tacked on to permanent insurance and many others .
One variation that appealed to me at first was the Money Smart Term Life policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. the American Express unit to the parent company 's credit-card holders .
Upon examination however I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense .
Amex said it would charge me 576 a year for 100,000 of coverage and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years .
Sounds great or does it .
First if I canceled I 'd have no more insurance a not insignificant consideration .
Second the 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation Amex not I would get the benefit of the investment income on my money income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit .
Third and most important Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile .
That would be all right with Amex which could then lock in its investment profit but it does n't add up to a smart money move for me .
Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else There is no free lunch there is only marketing .
And the Second Law unique to insurance .
If I die early I win a hollow victory since I ca n't enjoy it and if I live long the insurer wins .
Always .
This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance the kind that amasses cash value .
The word death can not be escaped entirely by the industry but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms preferring to talk about savings and investment instead .
The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature .
That is gilding the lily .
The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into .
That 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package .
Again no free lunch .
This is reflected in a built-in mortality cost in effect your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection .
And in most cases a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is in effect paying the salesman 's commission as well investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years largely because of this .
So view permanent insurance for what it is a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment .
The simplest most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy .
You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing and your cash value and dividends grow over the years .
One newer wrinkle so called single-premium life you pay for the whole policy at once has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy loans and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment .
Congress closed this loophole last year or thought it did .
However Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield Mass. has developed a combination plan of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences .
But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small .
I 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately so I look into the broad category called universal life .
Hugely popular it is far more flexible than straight whole life .
I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy .
In looking at these and other policies I learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into policy illustrations the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years .
They commonly give two scenarios One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees usually 4 % to 4.5 % and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment often 8.5 % or more .
Projecting the latter over several decades I find my cash buildup is impressive but can any high interest rate prevail for that long .
Not likely I think .
Also some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year .
These are not certain either .
Companies are n't comfortable playing these games but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good says Timothy Pfiefer an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast a unit of Towers Perrin Co. the big New York consulting firm .
Another factor to consider Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately .
There are seemingly endless twists to universal life and it pays to ask questions about all of them .
At a back-yard barbecue for example a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be guaranteed .
I call her agent David Dominici .
Yes he says premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to vanish after a certain period but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection .
If interest rates plunge the insurer may be knocking on my door asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection .
I do n't like the sound of that .
Some insurers have also started offering persistency bonuses such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield if the policy is maintained for 10 years .
But Glenn Daily a New York-based financial consultant warns that many of these bonuses are just fantasies because most are n't guaranteed by the companies .
And the feature is so new he adds that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments .
So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection .
Offered by insurers that include Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. Jackson National Life Insurance Co. and National Travelers Life Insurance Co. these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive .
Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer heart attarcks renal failure and kidney transplants .
But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined vary from policy to policy and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance .
Also financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes .
And considering the extra cost of
