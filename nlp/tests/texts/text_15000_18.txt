S&P 500 .
There is n't a boatload of big investors out there still waiting to get into indexing says P. James Kartalia vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. Chicago which offers both indexing and active management services .
After tripling in size in the past five years index funds now hold about 20 % of the stock owned by pension funds .
A further problem is razor-thin profits .
Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing and in some cases are just that .
To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free .
It 's like getting a free toaster when you open an account says Axe Core 's Mr. Lynn .
As a result indexers have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money .
And many have been successful as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader Westridge Capital .
Westridge Capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the S&P 500 's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage points over the past four years with the same risk level as holding the S&P 500 stocks according to James Carder the firm 's president .
Strategies vary for Westridge Capital which has 300 million under management .
The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies .
Mr. Carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines .
And in some months he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all .
By their nature our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover Mr. Carder adds .
The more turnover the better for our clients .
Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns .
J. Thomas Allen president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures .
You 're buying the S&P and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it he says .
But some indexers make little or no use of futures saying that these instruments present added risks for investors .
If the futures markets have a problem then those products could have a problem says John Zumbrunn managing director of Prudential Insurance Co. of America 's Investment Index Technologies Inc. unit .
Prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus 5\/100 of a percentage point .
An added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by Prudential .
There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds .
They include LIMITED RISK FUNDS These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains .
Here a fund may promise to pay back say 95 of every 100 invested for a year even if the market goes much lower .
The fund could invest 87 for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8 % to return the guaranteed 95 .
That leaves 13 which could be used to buy S&P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the S&P index .
MANAGER REPLICATION FUNDS Say a big investor is interested in growth stocks .
Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks the portfolio will be maintained by computer reducing both fees and in theory risk because of the large number of stocks .
We see a lot of interest in those kind of things says Frank Salerno a vice president of Bankers Trust .
People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies .
TILT FUNDS This is an index fund with a bet .
Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio .
One simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates this can avoid weak sisters but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds .
Another approach An investor with 100 million might use 75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other 25 million on a favorite group of stocks .
SPECIALIZED FUNDS Indexes can be constructed to serve social goals such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa .
Other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment .
Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System for example has about 130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either Pennsylvania-based or have 25 % of their work forces in the state .
Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month this time 4.2 % while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest .
The Big Board reported that short interest dropped to 523,920,214 shares as of Oct. 13 from 547,347,585 shares in mid-September .
Amex short interest climbed 3 % to 53,496,665 shares from 51,911,566 shares .
For the year-earlier month the Big Board reported 461,539,056 shares indicating a 13.5 % year-to-year rise while the Amex reported 36,015,194 shares a 48 % leap .
Amex short interest has been heading upward since mid-December with increases in each month since then except at mid-July .
Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender .
Short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders .
Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back .
Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging .
The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock .
The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month 's 3.38 .
The ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange 's average trading volume that would be required to convert the total short interest position .
Some analysts suggest however that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions .
Varity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares .

Your Oct. 12 editorial Pitiful Helpless Presidency .
correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3 .
You are absolutely wrong however in opining that this position is some kind of flip-flop something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls .
My position is one founded on both the facts and the law .
Although you may have forgotten public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative .
The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 9 10 and 11 1988 and again on April 4 1988 .
It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega 's criminality and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies .
Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him and to exploit the administration 's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing .
As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics but made a decision in the summer of 1986 to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled .
As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war .
This decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the United States as a hidden cost of the war .
Unfortunately this problem continued even after Gen. Noriega 's indictment .
Throughout 1988 and this year I and others in Congress have pressed the U.S. to develop a plan for pushing this narcokleptocrat out of Panama .
Regrettably two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable to develop any plan military or economic for supporting the Panamanian people in their attempts to restore democracy .
Sen. John Kerry D. Mass .
For Vietnamese these are tricky often treacherous times .
After years of hesitation economic and political reform was embraced at the end of 1986 but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action .
Vietnam is finding that turning a stagnant socialist order into a dynamic free market does n't come easy .
Here is how three Vietnamese are coping with change The Tire King Nguyen Van Chan is living proof that old ways die hard .
Mr. Chan used to be an oddity in Hanoi a private entrepreneur .
His business success made him an official target in pre-reform days .
Mr. Chan now 64 years old invented a fountain pen he and his family produced from plastic waste .
Later he marketed glue .
Both products were immensely popular .
For his troubles Mr. Chan was jailed three times between 1960 and 1974 .
Though his operation was registered and used only scrap he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials .
Once he was held for three months without being charged .
Things were supposed to change when Vietnam 's economic reforms gathered pace and for awhile they did .
After years of experimenting Mr. Chan produced a heavy-duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state-produced rival .
By 1982 he was selling thousands of tires .
Newspapers published articles about him and he was hailed as the tire king .
His efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition and attracted renewed attention from local authorities .
District police in 1983 descended on his suburban home which he and his large family used as both residence and factory and demanded proof the house and equipment were his .
He produced it .
That was the first time they lost and I won he says .
He was further questioned to determine if he was a real working man or an exploiter .
Says Mr. Chan When I showed it was from my own brain they lost for the second time .
But a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property .
Warned he was to be jailed again he fled to the countryside .
His family was given three hours to leave before the house and contents were confiscated .
With only the clothes they were wearing family members moved to a home owned by one of Mr. Chan 's sons .
After six months on the run Mr. Chan learned the order for his arrest had been canceled .
He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights .
He and his family kept afloat by repairing bicycles selling fruit and doing odd jobs .
Mr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 and became a minor celebrity again when his story was published in a weekly newspaper .
In 1988 18 months after the sixth congress formally endorsed family-run private enterprise district authorities allowed Mr. Chan to resume work .
By late last year he was invited back as the tire king to display his products at a national exhibition .
National leaders stopped by his stand to commend his achievements .
Mr. Chan now produces 1,000 bicycle and motorbike tires a month and 1,000 tins of tire-patching glue in the son 's small house .
Eighteen people pack the house 's two rooms the Chans four of their 10 children with spouses and eight of 22 grandchildren .
Most sleep on the floor .
Come daybreak eight family members and two other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street .
The primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small courtyard where an ancient press squeezes rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a bathtub filled with water .
Mr. Chan talks optimistically of expanding maybe even moving into the import-export field .
First however he has unfinished business .
When district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing they released only one of his machines .
They did n't return the rubber stock
