ions first authorized in 1988 .
The action came as Congress sent to President Bush a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated 156.7 billion for the Departments of Labor Education Health and Human Services .
Final approval was on a 67-31 roll call in the Senate which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. Bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women .
Reversing an eight-year federal policy the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest but Mr. Bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother 's life is in danger .
Mr. Bush 's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill .
The measure before the conference yesterday funds the Departments of State Justice and Commerce through fiscal 1990 .
An estimated 1.32 billion is provided for next year 's census and negotiators stripped a Senate-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens .
Elsewhere in the Commerce Department nearly 191.2 million is preserved for assistance programs under the Economic Development Administration .
And in a footnote to the fall of House Speaker James Wright this year the conference voted to rescind 11.8 million in unspent EDA funds for a Fort Worth Texas stockyards project that figured in ethics charges against the former Democratic leader .
Fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies and an 18 % increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission 's budget would be financed entirely by an added 26 million in filing fees .
In an unprecedented step the measure anticipates another 30 million in receipts by having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases a change that is almost certain to increase Pentagon costs in processing personnel and security clearances .
The bill does n't include an estimated 1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for Justice Department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the House .
But yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants .
Similarly the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of 1.6 million each in drug grants or three times the current minimum .
The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency .
Lawmakers scrapped all of a 7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville Spain but agreed elsewhere to 15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger .
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings D. S.C. who also chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the department attached 10 million for an advanced technology initiative including work on high-definition television .
His Republican counterpart Sen. Warren Rudman R. N.H. has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the Legal Services Corp .
An estimated 321 million is provided to maintain the program but Mr. Rudman also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed .
The effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until Oct. 1 next year and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the Food Research and Action Center .
The bill also provides 620.5 million to meet U.S. contributions to international organizations and 80 million for peace-keeping activities .
Both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal 1989 although the amount for peace-keeping shows a 27 % cut from the administration 's request .
Mercury Savings & Loan Association said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its lead investment banker to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the Huntington Beach Calif. thrift .
Mercury which has assets of more than 2 billion and 24 branches in California said the action to improve its regulatory capital position is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation .
Mercury also said it extended its two-year advisory relationship with Montgomery Securities of San Francisco .
Mercury 's stock closed yesterday at 4.875 unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Watching Congress sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors fighting the urge to spend more we 're reminded of those late-night movies in which the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says Stop me before I kill again .
The Members know they 're doing wrong but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions .
Arkansas Democrat David Pryor spilled his guts on the Senate floor the other day after he 'd joined the Finance Committee 's early-morning pork-barrel revels I must tell you I come to the floor tonight as one who ended up with a busload of extraneous matter .
It was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy .
He was turning himself in .
Frankly as I was walking back to get in my car I heard many many people opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for slipping this in he said .
As I was driving home I did not feel very good about myself .
We can applaud Mr. Pryor 's moment of epiphany even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again .
A good place to start the rehabilitation is a legislative line-item veto bill now being offered by Indiana Senator Dan Coats .
The Coats bill which already has 32 Senate co-sponsors is n't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills .
Instead it 's a form of enhanced rescission giving a President a chance to rescind or strike specific spending items that just go too far .
Under the proposal a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of rescissions to the Hill once when he proposes his budget and again after Congress disposes .
Congress would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50 % majority but then a President could veto that rejection .
Congress would then need the usual two-thirds majority to override any veto .
The proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the 1974 Budget Reform Act .
Before 1974 a President could impound or refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress .
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were both big users of the impoundment power but Congress saw its chance against a weakened President Nixon and stripped it away .
Today a President can still send up spending rescissions but they 're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind .
This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens and naturally rescissions are almost never approved .
In 1987 President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by Congress .
Senator Coats 's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts .
The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies but the police in the form of a President would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy as they do now .
Mr. Coats plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month .
President Bush has endorsed the idea and at least 50 sitting Senators have voted to support enhanced rescission authority in the past .
We 're told Senator Pryor is n't yet a co-sponsor but if he and his colleagues are serious about kicking their compulsions they 'll sign up .
Business and civic operations lurched back toward normalcy here as congressional officials estimated that the price tag for emergency assistance to earthquake-ravaged California would total at least 2.5 billion .
That is a minimum figure and I underscore minimum said House Speaker Thomas Foley D. Wash .
after conferring with California lawmakers .
It 's impossible to put an exact figure on it at this time .
The Office of Management and Budget has begun looking into legislation to provide more funds for earthquake repairs .
And California 's 45-member delegation in the House is expected to propose that emergency funds be added to a stop-gap spending bill that the House Appropriations Committee is to consider Monday .
For the most part major corporations ' headquarters and plants were unaffected or only slightly damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale .
One of the last big employers in the Silicon Valley to report in Seagate Technology said it expects to be back at full strength Monday .
The day before the quake Seagate completed three days of emergency training and drills .
Echoing the response of almost all big corporations in the Bay Area Don Waite Seagate 's chief financial officer said I would n't expect this to have any significant financial impact .
The city 's recovery from the earthquake was uneven .
Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90 % of their usual capacity but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled leaving the previously full hotel with an 80 % vacancy rate .
City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled .
Among the city 's banks Bank of America said all but eight of its 850 branches were open .
The closed branches in San Francisco Hayward Santa Clara and Santa Cruz sustained structural damage .
Power failures kept just seven of its 1,500 automated-teller machines off-line .
Securities-trading operations were moved to Bank of America 's Concord office and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to Los Angeles the bank said .
Wells Fargo & Co. said its Emergency Operations Committee which met all night Tuesday moved its global-funds transfer system to El Monte Calif. 500 miles to the south .
Only five of 496 branches statewide remain closed while 23 of 600 automated-teller machines remained out of order .
The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake 's epicenter 80 miles south of San Francisco .
Santa Cruz County estimates total damage at nearly 600 million .
Santa Clara County has a running total so far of 504 million excluding the hard-hit city of Los Gatos .
Oakland officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday a section of I-880 a twotiered highway collapsed in Oakland causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake .
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated that damages to the city total 2 billion .
That includes dwellings in the ravaged Marina district that must be demolished peeled business facades south of Market Street and houses in the city 's outer Richmond district that were heaved off their foundations .
Many streets and sidewalks buckled and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured .
The federal funds would go to a range of programs including the Federal Emergency Management Agency highway construction accounts and the Small Business Administration according to Rep. Vic Fazio D. Calif .
.
FEMA which coordinates federal disaster relief is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo which hit the Carolinas last month .
It is likely to get as much as 800 million initially in additional funds and eventually could get more than 1 billion according to Mr. Fazio a member of the House Appropriations Committee .
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements .
The Bush administration has at its disposal 273 million in funds remaining from the 1.1 billion Congress released for the cleanup after Hurricane Hugo .
We feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate short-term requirements Mr. Fitzwater said .
He added that the Office of Management and Budget the Transportation Department and other agencies are developing longer-term legislation that should be ready soon .
Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges .
California lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state .
Some things ca n't be repaired .
The Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park reports 10 million to 15 million in damage including shattered porcelains and stone figures .
Its neighbor the De Young Museum totaled 3 million to 5 million in structural damage and shattered sculpture .
The city 's main library is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the Beaux Arts City Hall broke off in the temblor .
The ground along the Embarcadero the street that skirts the city 's eastern boundary and piers dropped six inches after the quake wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers .
At San Francisco International Airport shock waves wrecked the control tower knocking down computers and shattering glass .
Offices of the city 's Rent Board were destroyed .
Mayor Agnos 's 2 billion estimate does n't include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city some of which remained closed .
A major chunk of the 2 billion is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency said a spokesman for Mr. Agnos .
All of the city 's 5.9 million emergency reserve was spent in the first 24 hours on overtime salaries he said .
Insurers struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices .
At Fireman 's Fund Corp. a spokesman said 142 claims were received in the first 24 hours after the quake and the company is braced for as many as 5,000 claims from its 35,000 residential and 35,000 business policyholders in the affected area .
Claims range from a scratched fender and there were an awful lot of cars damaged in this to a major processing plant a spokesman said .
We 're delivering a check for 750,000 to an automotive business in Berkeley that burned on Tuesday .
Fireman 's is part of a 38 million syndicate that supplies business interruption insurance to the city on the Bay Bridge which must pay employees during the three weeks or more it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income .
California lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a 100 million cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads .
In addition under the highway-relief program the federal government provides 100 % of emergency highway aid for only the first 90 days of a repair effort .
After that the federal share diminishes .
For interstate highways the federal share normally would drop to 90 % of the cost of repairs and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost .
But lawmakers want to extend the period for 100 % federal funding for several months .
Those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by Hurricane Hugo South Carolina and the U.S. Virgin Islands according to an aide to Rep. Fazio .
Meanwhile the FEMA announced a toll-free telephone number 800-462-9029 to expedite service to victims of the earthquake .
Lines will be available 24 hours a day to take applications for such disaster relief as temporary housing and emergency home repairs by phone .
Transportation officials are expecting utter traffic pandemonium beginning Monday and growing worse over the next several weeks .
Some 250,000 cars normally cross the closed Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco daily .
Officials say it is clear that alternate routes ca n't handle the overflow .
The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem .
Moreover state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the area 's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours .
Even so We 're looking for chaos said George Gray a deputy district director at the California Department of Transportation .
If there 's any way you can do it you ought to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while .
Most of San Francisco 's tourists and business travelers already have left despite hotel 's offers of rate cuts .
Everyone left said Peter Lang reservations manager of the Mark Hopkins Hotel .
The Westin St. Francis hotel which survived the 1906 earthquake and fire currently is less than 50 % occupied .
We still have our die-hard baseball fans a spokesman said .
One lady from New York said she 's not going home until the World Series is over .

Is an American Secretary of State seriously suggesting that the Khmer Rouge should help govern Cambodia .
Apparently so .
There are no easy choices in Cambodia but we ca n't imagine that it benefits the U.S. to become the catalyst for an all-too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in Cambodia .
Now that Vietnam appears to have pulled out its occupation army the State Department is talking again about accepting an interim coalition government in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh .
The coalition would include the current Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen regime the two non-communist resistance groups led by Son Sann and Prince Sihanouk and the Khmer Rouge .
The aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of Cambodia by allowing the Khmer Rouge a small share of power .
The State Department says that any Khmer Rouge participation would have to be minimal .
The usual problem with including communists in interim coalition governments is that their ideology and methods require they squeeze out everyone else .
Recall that Nicaragua 's Sandinistas came into Managua as partners in a coalition government with anti-Somoza moderates .
Within two years the moderates were exiled or in prison Nicaragua had gone communist and the Sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in Latin America and threatening their neighbors .
In Laos when the Western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination .
Even Mao Tse-tung 's China began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller non-communist parties .
What complicates the scene in Cambodia is that the current regime is already communist as are its Vietnamese overseers back in Hanoi as are the Khmer Rouge who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups .
It 's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear .
That would leave Hun Sen and the Khmer Rouge .
The Hun Sen regime has sent thousands of conscript laborers to die of malaria and malnourishment while building Cambodia 's equivalent of the Berlin Wall near the Thai border .
The Khmer Rouge however carry an unsurpassed record for Cambodian tyranny .
These utopians caused the deaths by starvation disease or execution of well over one million Cambodians .
The Cambodian horror was so bad that the Vietnamese occupation in 1978 was a perverse form of relief .
The world might want to believe that the Khmer Rouge ca n't still be such bad guys just as in the late 1970s it was reluctant to credit the reports of genocide then taking place .
But there is no solid evidence that the Khmer Rouge have changed .
Some of our sources in Thailand say the notorious old Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot has been holed up this summer in Khmer Rouge camps near the Thai-Cambodian border .
So it 's difficult to swallow the notion that Mr. Baker is willing to accept conditions that would help the Khmer Rouge set up shop again in Phnom Penh .
True Prince Sihanouk backs the idea of such a coalition at least for this week .
But Prince Sihanouk has backed all sorts of ideas over the years and done rather better by himself than by Cambodia .
Nor should the U.S. worry much about offending China which still aids the Khmer Rouge .
It 's time the State Department recognized that China does not play by gentlemen 's rules .
For the U.S. to lend even the slightest support to the most infamous killers on Indochina 's bleak scene could only disturb America 's allies elsewhere .
It would be entirely rational for communist insurgents in countries such as the Philippines or Peru to conclude the following Fight viciously enough and the U.S. under the banner of pragmatism might eventually help negotiate your way to victory .
U.S. diplomacy has done it before and it will likely do it again .
The administration and Congress have lately tangoed around the idea of sending military aid to Cambodia 's non-communists .
But now the possibility of diplomatic movement Vietnam 's withdrawal the Baker initiative has put that plan on hold with the proviso that if the going got rough the U.S. would then rearm the opposition .
Why the timidity .
At the very least the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the Khmer Rouge and Cambodia 's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents .
When that day comes it would be particularly awful to know that the United States sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means to settle their fate with at least a little honor .
Michael F. Harris 53 was named executive vice president North America for the Financial Times the business newspaper published by this company that also has interests in book publishing fine china oil services and investment banking .
Mr. Harris had been vice president for the newspaper 's advertising in New York .

Cipher Data Products Inc. posted a net loss of 14.2 million or 97 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter compared with net income of 3.8 million or 27 cents a share a year ago .
Revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 20 % to 41.3 million from 51.9 million in the year-earlier period .
Cipher Data a San Diego maker of magnetic tape peripherals and optical disc drives said the loss included reserves of 3.8 million related to a corporate restructuring .
The restructuring calls for a 24 % reduction in its work force over the next two months affecting about 525 jobs Cipher Data said .
It is eliminating the positions of president and chief operating officer formerly held by Edward L. Marinaro .
Cipher Data said Mr. Marinaro consequently has resigned from those posts and from the company 's board .
Mr. Marinaro could n't immediately be reached for comment .
FileNet Corp. Costa Mesa Calif. said it expects to report a third-quarter loss of about 1.8 million or 17 cents a share because of a 2.5 million reserve to be taken against potential losses on a contract with the state of California .
Revenue is estimated at 18.6 million .
The maker of document image processing equipment said the state procurement division had declared FileNet in default on its contract with the secretary of state uniform commercial code division .
FileNet said it does n't believe the state has a valid basis of default and is reviewing its legal rights under the contract but said it ca n't predict the outcome of the dispute .
The disagreement centers on testing deadlines and other issues involving a FileNet system installed earlier this year .
State officials could n't be reached for comment late yesterday .
FileNet noted that it had cash and marketable securities totaling 22.5 million on Sept. 30 and stockholders ' equity is 60.1 million .
The company made the announcement after the close of the markets where its stock finished at 10.75 up 25 cents in over-the-counter trading .
Clinton Gas Systems Inc. said it received a contract from Timken Co. Canton Ohio to manage the natural gas purchasing scheduling and transportation activities for Timken 's seven Ohio and two Pennsylvania plants .
Clinton and Timken agreed not to disclose the value of the contract .
Timken a producer of bearings and specialty steel already buys gas from Clinton .
Clinton said in Columbus Ohio that its Clinton Gas Marketing unit wants to line up a number of such gas management contracts .
Manufacturers frequently do n't have anyone who is a specialist in natural gas Clinton said and a specialist such as Clinton can save them substantial amounts of money .

The Lone Star is on the rise again .
As the music swells viewers discover they 're watching a commercial for Lone Star Beer the pride of Texas a product of G. Heileman Brewing Co. a La Crosse Wis. unit of Bond Corp .
As the ad 's tone implies the Texas spirit is pretty xenophobic these days and Lone Star is n't alone in trying to take advantage of that .
From Chevy trucks to Lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks the state has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating Texans and castigating outsiders .
While advertisers have long appealed to Texans ' state pride and prejudices the latest trend has been sparked in part by the state 's recent hard economic times .
That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that Texas is the only state that was once a nation but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders .
In the past writes Houston Chronicle columnist Jim Barlow outlanders were accepted only after passing a series of tests to prove they had the right Texas attitudes and of course they had to be dipped for parasites .
There is no small irony in the fact that some of the most-jingoistic advertising comes courtesy of you guessed it outsiders .

Texas has lost its distinctiveness leaving Texans with a hunger to feel proud about themselves says Stephen Klineberg a sociology professor at Rice University Houston .
This plays right into the hands of the advertising agencies .
For example the iced-tea radio campaign for Thomas J. Lipton Co. an Englewood Cliffs N.J. unit of Anglo-Dutch Unilever Group emphatically proclaims Real Texans do not wear dock-siders ever .
Real Texans do n't play paddleball at least I hope not .
This is football country .

And ad agencies insist that they do .

Ford trucks may outsell Chevy trucks in places like Connecticut and Long Island sniffs a commercial for Chevrolet a division of General Motors Corp .
