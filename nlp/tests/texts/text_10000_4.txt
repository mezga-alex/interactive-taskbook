vious company .
But going against the grain has never bothered Mr. Andersson .
Stroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview the diminutive Swede quips It turned out to be lucky for us .
If the whole market thinks what you 're doing is crazy you do n't have much competition .
Mr. Andersson is anxious to strengthen Trelleborg 's balance sheet .
Characteristically he did n't waste much time getting started .
On Tuesday Trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions minerals processing and building and distribution as separately quoted companies on Stockholm 's Stock Exchange .
At current market prices the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor 386 million to Trelleborg 's coffers analysts say .
The board had also been expected to approve a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares .
But that share issue intended to make Trelleborg better known among international investors was postponed until market conditions stabilize people familiar with the situation say .
Trelleborg 's internationally traded Bfree series stock plunged SKr29 4.48 to SKr205 31.65 in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm .
Tuesday the shares regained SKr20 closing at SKr225 .
Mr. Andersson says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help erase the conglomerate stigma that has held down Trelleborg 's share price .
Trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50 % of both units .
The spinoff should solve a problem for the parent .
A family foundation set up by late founder Henry Dunker controls 59 % of Trelleborg 's voting shares outstanding .
But the foundation bylaws require the entire Trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below 50 % .
That possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance Trelleborg 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding .
That growth is the result of Mr. Andersson 's shopping spree during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years .
Most of the new additions were barely profitable if not outright loss makers .
Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker AB Electrolux Mr. Andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood and got quick results .
The treatment turned Trelleborg into one of Scandinavia 's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns .
Between 1985 and 1988 sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold .
Many analysts expect Mr. Andersson who owns 1.7 % of the company to be named Trelleborg 's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year .
But the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style Mr. Andersson describes as being the driving force leading the troops not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for people to bring me ideas .
Last month in his boldest move yet Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern Falconbridge Ltd .
Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern .
Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. says Mike Kurtanjek a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. London .
But we certainly like what we 've seen so far .
But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles .
Mr. Andersson acknowledges that the company 's mining division will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion .
Booming metals prices have fueled Trelleborg 's recent profit surge raising mining 's share of pretax profit to 68 % this year from a big loss two years earlier .
But analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth .
Mining is likely to remain Trelleborg 's main business .
Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture .
Noranda and Trelleborg each came close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid .
Some analysts say Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge and that the Swedes relatively inexperienced in international mining operations could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf .
Mr. Andersson insists that Trelleborg and Noranda have n't discussed a Falconbridge break-up .
Falconbridge he says will continue operating in its current form .
We 'd be reluctant to accept ownership in a manufacturing company .
But such partnerships are common in mining where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner Trelleborg 's president says .
Perhaps more important both companies share Mr. Andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries .
If the 1980s were a decade of consumption the 90s will be the investment decade Mr. Andersson says .
The whole of Europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment he says .
That 's beginning to change .
And investment is the key word for base metals and most other businesses Trelleborg is in .

John Sculley chairman and chief executive officer credited the Macintosh SE\/30 and IIcx computers introduced in the winter for the brightened sales performance .
Mr. Sculley also indicated that sagging margins which dogged the company through most of 1989 began to turn up in the fourth quarter as chip prices eased .
Adverse pressure on gross margins has subsided Mr. Sculley said .
Margins in the fiscal fourth quarter perked up rising to 51 % from 49.2 % a year earlier .
For all of fiscal 1989 however the average gross margin was 49 % below the average 1988 gross margin of 51 % .
Lower component costs especially for DRAMs or dynamic random access memory chips were cited for the easing of margin pressure on the company a spokeswoman said .
Looking ahead to 1990 Mr. Sculley predicted another year of significant revenue growth along with improved profitability as the recovery in gross margins continues into 1990 .
