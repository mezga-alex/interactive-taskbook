 in connection with the offer and solicitation .
The debt issues involved and the proposed consent fees and cash tender offer prices expressed per 1,000 of principal amount are as follows 10 1\/2 % senior notes due 1994 at 101 % 11 % subordinated debt due 1999 at 102 % 9 3\/8 % notes due 1993 at 100 % and 8 3\/8 % notes due 1996 at 95.25 % .
Holiday said its 15 % notes due 1992 also will be included in the tender offer and consent solicitation at a price to be determined by Holiday prior to the commencement of the offer .
The television units of Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. are exploring the possibility of offering prime-time programming to independent stations two nights a week industry executives say .
Although such a venture would n't match the fourth network created by News Corp. 's Fox Broadcasting Co. MCA and Paramount may have similar ambitions .
Fox which also owns six TV stations provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates .
Paramount Domestic TV and MCA TV formed a joint venture last month named Premier Advertiser Sales to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies such as Star Trek the Next Generation Charles in Charge and Friday the 13th the Series .
A spokeswoman for Paramount said the company does n't comment on speculation .
Calls to Shelly Schwab president of MCA TV were n't returned .
The two companies like Fox already have their own TV stations .
MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed to purchase a 79 % stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued at 140 million .
TVX owns five stations including WTXF a Fox affiliate in Philadelphia .
One broadcasting executive familiar with the project said the co-venture would target stations affiliated with Fox because Fox has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities .
Currently Fox supplies programs on Saturdays Sundays and Mondays although the company plans to expand to other weeknights .
Jamie Kellner president of Fox Broadcasting said We believe the partnership of Fox its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow .
Another Fox official who declined to be identified said Fox was n't pleased by the possible Paramount-MCA venture into prime-time programming .
To make the venture work they would need Fox affiliates he said .
We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations he said adding that Fox does n't appreciate another company attempting to usurp its station lineup .
Fox said it plans to offer its stations movies theatrical and made-for-TV ventures probably on Wednesdays sometime next year .
It is also planning another night of original series .
Paramount and MCA according to the broadcasting executive plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by Paramount and MCA for Wednesdays and perhaps a block of original shows Fridays .
The executive said Paramount and MCA have also held discussions with Chris-Craft Industries ' broadcasting unit which owns five independent stations in cities such as Los Angeles San Francisco and Portland Ore .
A Chris-Craft station manager said there have been no formal talks .
I think it 's to Fox 's advantage to be associated with the Paramount-MCA venture said Michael Conway station manager of WTXF the TVX station that is a Fox affiliate .
Mr. Conway said the Fox shows appearing on nights when Paramount-MCA shows would n't be offered could be promoted on the programs produced by Paramount-MCA .
Michael Fisher general manager of KTXL a Fox affiliate in Sacramento Calif. said The real question is whether the Paramount-MCA offering is practical .
It is n't .
Why would I consider giving up Fox a proven commodity for an unknown venture .
Fox attracts a young audience with shows such as Married With Children its most successful series .
Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and BanPonce Corp. agreed to merge in a transaction valued at 324 million .
Under the agreement BanPonce stockholders will be able to exchange each of their shares for either shares in the new entity or cash .
In each case the exchange is valued at 56.25 a share .
The two companies both based in San Juan will form a bank holding company with assets of just over 9 billion .
The holding company will be called BanPonce Corp .
The primary subsidiary will be the combined banking operations of the two companies and will be known as Banco Popular de Puerto Rico .
Rafael Carrion Jr. chairman of Banco Popular will be the chairman of the holding company .
Alberto M. Paracchini currently chairman of BanPonce will serve as president of the bank holding company and chairman of the subsidiary .
Banco Popular originally proposed the merger in July in a cash and stock transaction valued at 50 a share or about 293 million .
BanPonce reacted cooly at first but appeared to be won over analysts said by Banco Popular 's assurances that it wanted only a friendly transaction .
Banco Popular just kept waiting said Edward Thompson a vice president and analyst at Thomson BankWatch Inc. in New York .
They got a transaction that 's good for both companies .
The two banks appear to be a good fit .
BanPonce caters to a more affluent customer while Banco Popular has always had a large presence among middle-income and lower-income markets .
The merger should also allow the companies to reduce costs by combining operations in many locations in Puerto Rico .
They 're often right across the street from one another Mr. Thompson said .
Richard Carrion who is currently president and chief executive officer of Banco Popular said the merger will result in a larger and stronger locally based bank .
Mr. Carrion who will now serve as president and chief executive officer of the subsidiary bank added We 'll be able to better compete with large foreign banks .
It makes sense from a strategic standpoint .
The newly merged company will have 165 branches in Puerto Rico and 27 branches outside of the island .
The banks said they do n't expect the merger to face any regulatory hurdles .
Mr. Carrion said the merger should be completed in six to nine months .
Hit by higher costs and lower sales Caterpillar Inc. said third-quarter earnings tumbled 43 % and full-year earnings will trail last year 's results .
The construction equipment maker said third-quarter profit fell to 108 million or 1.07 a share from 190 million or 1.87 a share a year earlier .
Sales dropped 6 % to 2.58 billion from 2.74 billion reflecting eight fewer business days in the latest quarter .
The company which is in a costly modernization program said earnings were hurt by higher start-up and new program costs increased costs of materials higher wages and an 11 million provision for bad debts in Latin America .
In announcing a 1989 capital spending plan of 950 million early this year Caterpillar said full-year earnings would be flat compared with last year 's 616 million or 6.07 a share .
But yesterday the company said this year 's profit will be lower .
It did n't say by how much .
Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production that cut orders for its engines Caterpillar also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the Peoria area and temporarily shut its plant in York Pa. for two weeks in both November and December .
For the first nine months of the year Caterpillar said earnings fell 14 % to 390 million or 3.85 a share from 453 million or 4.46 a share a year earlier .
Sales rose to 8.19 billion from 7.65 billion .
Millicom Inc. said it is one of two companies to receive a license to introduce and operate a cellular mobile telephone system in Pakistan .
The market during the start-up is estimated at 25,000 subscribers .
A spokeswoman for Millicom a telecommunications company said she did n't know the value of the contract .
Cable & Wireless PLC of Britain won the other license .
Millicom said it would build and operate the system in Pakistan with Comvik International AB part of the Kinnevik group of Sweden and Arfeen International Pakistan .
B.A.T Industries PLC won overwhelming shareholder approval for a defensive restructuring to fend off a 13.35 billion 21.23 billion takeover bid from Sir James Goldsmith .
At a shareholders ' meeting in London the tobacco financial-services and retailing giant said it received 99.9 % approval from voting holders for plans to spin off about 6 billion in assets .
B.A.T aims to sell such U.S. retailing units as Marshall Field and Saks Fifth Avenue and float its big paper and British retailing businesses via share issues to existing holders .
Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10 % or about 153 million of its shares and a 50 % dividend increase .
B.A.T yesterday started its share buy-back .
The company said it acquired 2.5 million shares for 785 pence 12.48 each or a total of 19.6 million 31.2 million from its broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd .
The share buy-back plan is likely to underpin B.A.T 's share price .
B.A.T said it may make more equity purchases until the close of business today depending on market conditions but will cease further purchases until Nov. 22 when it releases third-quarter results .
B.A.T shares rose 29 pence to 783 pence on London 's stock exchange yesterday .
Shareholder approval sets the stage for a lengthy process of restructuring that might not be completed until next year 's second half .
Before the recent tumult in global financial markets B.A.T officials holders and analysts had expected a substantial part of the restructuring to be complete by the end of the first half .
We are not in any hurry to sell Saks Marshall Field or B.A.T 's other U.S. retail properties said Chairman Patrick Sheehy .
This is n't a distress sale .
We are determined to get good prices .
Company officials say the flotations of the paper and British retailing businesses are likely only after the disposals of the U.S. retailing assets .
Meanwhile Sir James still is pursuing efforts to gain U.S. insurance regulators ' approval for a change in control of B.A.T 's Farmers Group Inc. unit .
The Anglo-French financier has indicated he intends to bid again for B.A.T if he receives approval .
Hasbro Inc. the nation 's largest toy maker reported third-quarter earnings increased 73 % from a year earlier on a 9.4 % sales gain reflecting improved margins .
Hasbro said it had net income of 31.3 million or 53 cents a share up from 18.1 million or 31 cents a share a year earlier when it took a pretax charge of 10 million after dropping development of an interactive video entertainment system .
Revenue rose to 403 million from 368.4 million .
The company cited sales gains at its Milton Bradley and Playskool units and in its international business for the increase in revenue .
Alan G. Hassenfeld chairman and chief executive added that Hasbro 's new line of battery-powered racing cars called Record Breakers and its acquisition of Cabbage Patch Kids Scrabble and other lines from Coleco Industries Inc. puts the company in a good position as we enter the Christmas buying season .
For the first nine months of the year Hasbro 's net income rose 33 % to 68.2 million or 1.15 a share from 51.3 million or 88 cents a share on a 3.1 % increase in revenue to 992.7 million from 963 million a year earlier .
Reebok International Ltd. posted a 35 % increase in third-quarter net income despite a slight decline in sales .
The athletic footwear maker said net rose to 49.9 million or 44 cents a share from 37.1 million or 32 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales declined 3 % to 524.5 million from 539.4 million .
Paul Fireman Reebok chairman and chief executive officer said Our gains in earnings provide further evidence that the controls we have put in place and our sales mix are continuing to improve the company 's overall profit performance .
The company said it expects sales to improve due to a number of new products including a pump basketball shoe that can be inflated to better fit the foot .
In the first nine months net was 140 million or 1.23 a share on sales of 1.44 billion .
Separately Reebok completed the acquisition of CML Group Inc. 's Boston Whaler unit a builder of power boats .
CML Acton Mass. had agreed to sell the unit to Reebok for about 42 million .
The agreement also called for Reebok to receive warrants to purchase 400,000 shares of CML common at 31.25 a share exercisable at any time before July 1 An outside spokesman for CML said the terms were changed to a minor extent but would n't disclose what those changes were .
Pitney Bowes Inc. directors authorized the company to seek buyers for its Wheeler Group Inc. subsidiary a direct mail marketer of office supplies .
Pitney Bowes said the decision was based on a long-term analysis of the compatibility of Wheeler Group 's marketing business with other Pitney Bowes operations .
Pitney Bowes acquired the core of what evolved into Wheeler Group in 1979 by buying Dictaphone Corp .
A spokeswoman would n't comment on whether the company had talked with any potential buyers for the New Hartford Conn. unit which had 1988 sales of about 75 million .
She said Wheeler Group was profitable but would n't give figures .
The spokeswoman said the company does n't have a timetable for the sale adding that the board 's decision just starts the search for a buyer .
Separately Pitney Bowes said third-quarter net income gained 15 % to 62 million or 78 cents a share from 54 million or 68 cents a share a year ago .
Revenue grew 13 % to 734.8 million from 650.9 million .
The company said the growth was led by its major operations particularly mailing shipping dictating and facsimile businesses .
Steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the Nimitz Freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the double-decker highway last year by California 's Department of Transportation employees familiar with the project say .
The test project which reportedly survived Tuesday 's earthquake was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings .
State engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed that was responsible for the collapse .
The failure in Oakland of the freeway segment known as the Cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared .
Sorting out the wreckage is expected to take several days .
Red tractors gingerly picked at the rubble while jackhammers tried to break up some of the massive slabs of concrete .
Giant yellow cranes were wheeled up alongside the collapsed segment preparing to lift off chunks of the debris .
In Sacramento a transportation department spokesman said he could n't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work .
However he asserted that the department had n't mastered the technology needed to retrofit the entire Cypress structure .
Moreover other officials noted snafus in transportation funding that the state has experienced over the years may have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting even if it were technologically feasible .
Knowledgeable employees said the retrofitting which had n't yet been budgeted was part of a planned three-stage reinforcement of the Cypress structure begun by the California transportation department several years ago .
The Cypress reinforcement project itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes .
The state began such work after a 1971 tremblor in Southern California when numerous bridges collapsed .
We had just finished phase two of the Cypress project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock a state DOT engineer said .
After completing installation of the jackets on one frame of the freeway last year the state DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers to draw up a final design .
Knowledgeable employees said the project had been stymied somewhat by the difficulty of designing the jackets .
The procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with steel then connecting them more securely to the double-decker roadbed .
The employees also said the project may have been snagged by budgetary concerns .
One preliminary estimate put the retrofitting cost at as much as 50 million .
The collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials .
Gov. George Deukmejian who said he had been assured by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake called for an immediate investigation .
I want to know who made the decision that it was safe for 186,000 people to use every day said Richard Katz a state legislator who is chairman of the California Assembly 's transportation committee .
He said he would convene hearings within two weeks .
The Cypress structure opened in June 1957 and as such like many buildings in the San Francisco Bay area does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support .
The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake .
Transportation department officials however said they were as surprised as anyone by the Cypress destruction .
They said previous earthquakes suggested that multiple-column viaducts would stand up well although they were working on ways to bolster them .
Unfortunately there is only one laboratory for developing techniques to withstand earthquakes and that is an earthquake said Burch Bachtold San Francisco district director for the transportation department .
He said We know of no technology that exists anywhere in the world that would allow us to reinforce the columns .
Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara said it rescheduled to Nov. 29 a special shareholder meeting to vote on a 75 million stock-for-debt exchange .
The meeting had been scheduled for Nov. 10 but the company delayed the meeting to allow time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the proposal .
As part of a restructuring announced earlier this year the company proposed in August to exchange 168 newly issued common shares for each 1,000 face value of debt .
However that figure could be revised Financial Corp. said .
Currently the company has about six million common shares outstanding .
If all the debt was converted about 13 million new shares would be issued .
In composite trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange Financial Corp. closed at 1.125 unchanged .
The debt consists of 50 million of 13 3\/8 % subordinated notes due 1998 and 25 million of 9 % convertible subordinated debentures due 2012 .
Financial Corp. also is proposing to exchange each of its 130,000 outstanding shares of cumulative convertible preferred series A stock for two shares of common .
After years of quarreling over Bonn 's Ostpolitik West Germany and the U.S. appear to have shifted onto a united course in Eastern Europe .
Bonn and Washington have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit .
Both hope to encourage pressure for change in East bloc countries still ruled by Stalinist holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for Poland Hungary and to a lesser extent the Soviet Union .
West German officials also have the special goal of holding out hope for East Germany 's fledgling reform movement .
The change taking place in the Soviet Union Poland and Hungary has aroused new hope in both German states that reforms will be undertaken in East Germany and that relations between the two German states too will get better said Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher .
Addressing a conference of the New York-based Institute for East-West Security Studies in Frankfurt yesterday Mr. Genscher said History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities that emerge from these reforms .
The ultimate aim of Western support for East bloc reforms he said is to create an equitable and stable peaceful order in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals .
Mr. Genscher and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher in separate speeches at the conference appealed for more Western contributions to economic reforms and business development in Hungary and Poland .
Bonn and Washington are leading supporters of Poland 's request for a 1 billion stand-by credit from the International Monetary Fund .
We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in Hungary and in Poland to succeed .
We are prepared to support those changes said Mr. Mosbacher .
U.S. curbs on the exports of sensitive technology to East bloc countries will remain in place however .
Meanwhile the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday approved an 837.5 million aid package for Poland and Hungary that more than doubles the amount President Bush had requested .
The package was brought to the House just 15 days after it was introduced indicating Congress 's eagerness to reward Poland and Hungary for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reforms .
The legislation approved 345-47 and sent to the Senate establishes two enterprise funds to be governed by independent nonprofit boards which will make loans and investments in new business ventures in Hungary and Poland .
The Polish fund would be seeded with 160 million the Hungarian fund with 40 million .
In addition a group of 24 industrialized countries including the U.S. and Japan and coordinated by the European Community Commission has promised Poland and Hungary trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to 1.11 billion through the European Investment Bank while the EC plans 222 million in direct aid .
When Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels to Poland Nov. 9 he is expected to take with him a promise of three billion West German marks 1.6 billion in new credit guarantees for industrial projects .
Last week Bonn agreed to reschedule 2.5 billion marks in Polish debt that came due last year .
In addition a one billion mark credit dating from 1974 is to be written off .
Poland 's plan to switch to a free-market economy by 1991 is hampered by a foreign debt load of 39.2 billion .
West Germany also has increased its credit guarantees to Hungary by 500 million marks to 1.5 billion marks as the emerging democratic state rushes through its own economic reforms including a broad privatization of state-owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment .
An additional 500 million marks in credit-backing was promised by the West German state governments of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg .
Deutsche Bank AG which last year arranged a three billion mark credit for the Soviet Union is now moving to become the first West German bank to set up independent business offices in Hungary and Poland as they shift to free-market economies .
A maxim of Frankfurt banking holds that wherever Deutsche Bank goes other West German banks follow .
Indeed at least four other West German banks are believed to be making inquiries .
Mattel Inc. said third-quarter net income rose 73 % to 38 million or 76 cents a share from 21.9 million or 45 cents a share a year ago .
Revenue rose 34 % to 410 million from 306.6 million a year earlier .
Mattel 's world-wide volume has grown 25 % in a climate of relatively flat industry sales said John W. Amerman chairman .
He said the toy company 's prospects for a strong fourth quarter are also good .
Mattel attributed the jump in quarter net to strong world-wide sales of its Barbie doll Hot Wheels cars Disney toys and other well-known toy lines .
The company also cited retail trade and consumer demand for new products introduced this year such as Cherry Merry Muffin and Turtle Tots .
For the nine months Mattel net more than doubled to 58.9 million or 1.19 a share from 25.4 million or 53 cents a share a year ago .
Revenue rose 25 % to 877.6 million from 702.4 million .
Mattel said the company 's sale of rights to land and buildings at its Hawthorne Calif. headquarters resulted in a 13 million charge to third-quarter operating profit .
The charge did n't affect net for the quarter as it was offset by tax benefits .
Mattel has purchased a new headquarters building in El Segundo Calif. which it will occupy by the end of next year .
Democracy can be cruel to politicians Sometimes it forces them to make choices .
Now that the Supreme Court opened the door on the subject of abortion politicians are squinting under the glare of democratic choice .
Their discomfort is a healthy sign for the rest of us .
Republicans are squinting most painfully at least at first which is only fair because they 've been shielded the most .
So long as abortion was a question for litigation not legislation Republicans could find political security in absolutism .
They could attract one-issue voters by adopting the right-to-life movement 's strongest position even as pro-choice Republicans knew this mattered little on an issue monopolized by the court .
Now it matters .
Much of Washington thought it detected George Bush in a characteristic waffle on abortion the past week .
Only a month ago he 'd warned Congress not to pass legislation to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest .
Last Friday after Congress passed it anyway he hinted he was looking for compromise .
Was the man who once was pro-choice but later pro-life converting again .
In fact Mr. Bush 's dance was more wiggle than waffle .
Pro-life advocates say the White House never wavered over the veto .
Christopher Smith R. N.J. a pro-life leader in the House suggested a compromise that would have adapted restrictive language from rape and incest exceptions in the states .
The White House never eager for a fight was happy to try which is why George Bush said he was looking for flexibility last week .
When Democrats refused to budge pro-life Republicans met at the White House with Chief of Staff John Sununu on Monday and Mr. Bush quickly signaled a veto .
Amid charges of timidity on Panama and elsewhere the president was n't about to offend his most energetic constituency .
The GOP doubters were in Congress .
In last week 's House vote 41 Republicans defected .
After the vote Connecticut Rep. Nancy Johnson rounded up nearly as many signatures on a letter to Mr. Bush urging him not to veto .
Even such a pro-life stalwart as Sen. Orrin Hatch R. Utah had counseled some kind of compromise .
The Senate passed the same bill yesterday with a veto-proof majority of 67 .
The manuevering illustrates an emerging Republican donnybrook pacified since the early 1980s .
At the 1988 GOP convention abortion was barely discussed at all though delegates were evenly divided on the question of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment .
Ms. Johnson made a passionate statement to the platform committee but she was talking to herself .
Now many Republicans are listening .
They 're frightened by what they see in New Jersey and especially Virginia where pro-life GOP candidates for governor are being pummeled on abortion .
Eddie Mahe a Republican consultant says the two GOP candidates could have avoided trouble if they had framed the issue first .
In Virginia Marshall Coleman and his running mate Eddy Dalton are both on the defensive for opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest .
But Mr. Mahe adds The net loser in the next few years is the right-to-life side .
Darla St. Martin of the National Right to Life Committee says exit polls from the 1988 election had single-issue pro-life voters giving Mr. Bush about five more percentage points of support than pro-choice voters gave Michael Dukakis .
But the Supreme Court 's opening of debate may have changed even that .
GOP pollster Neil Newhouse of the Wirthlin Group says polls this summer showed that the single-issue voters had about evened out .
Polls are no substitute for principle but they 'll do for some politicians .
The Republican danger is that abortion could become for them what it 's long been for Democrats a divisive litmus test .
It 's already that in the Bush administration at least for any job in which abortion is even remotely an issue .
Oklahoma official Robert Fulton lost a chance for a senior job in the Department of Health and Human Services after right-to-life activists opposed him .
Caldwell Butler a conservative former congressman was barred from a Legal Services post after he gave wrong answers on abortion .
Even the president 's doctor Burton Lee has said on the record that he 'd love to be surgeon general but could n't pass the pro-life test .
In the case of HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan the litmus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the Republican coalition .
After Mr. Sullivan waffled on abortion last year the White House appeased right-to-lifers by surrounding him with pro-life deputies .
Their views on health care and welfare did n't much matter though HHS spends billions a year on both .
It makes only a handful of abortion-related decisions .
Though Democrats can gloat at all this for now they may want to contain their glee .
On abortion their own day will come .
Eventually even Republicans will find a way to frame the issue in ways that expose pro-choice absolutism .
Does the candidate favor parental consent for teen-age abortions .
The pro-choice lobby does n't .
What about banning abortions in the second and third trimesters .
The lobby says no again .
Democracy is forcing the abortion debate toward healthy compromise toward the unpolarizing middle .
Roe v. Wade pre-empted political debate so the extremes blossomed .
Now the ambivalent middle a moral majority of sorts is reasserting itself .
Within a few years the outcome in most states is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted but not completely banned .
This is where the voters are which is where politicians usually end up .
Union Pacific Corp .
third-quarter net income fell 17 % .

The Federal Trade Commission ruled that five major title-insurance companies illegally fixed prices for title search-and-examination services by participating in joint rating bureaus in six states .
The FTC ordered the companies not to use rating bureaus in those six states .
The commission order named the following companies Ticor Title Insurance Co. of California a unit of Los Angeles-based Ticor Chicago Title Insurance Co. and Safeco Title Insurance Co. units of Chicago Title & Trust Co. Lawyers Title Insurance Corp. a unit of Richmond Va.-based Universal Corp. and Stewart Title Guaranty Co. a unit of Houston-based Stewart Information Services Corp .
Chicago Title & Trust acquired Safeco in 1987 and changed the unit 's name to Security Union Title Insurance Co .
The FTC ruled that the companies violated federal antitrust law by fixing rates in the following states New Jersey Pennsylvania Connecticut Wisconsin Arizona and Montana .
The FTC first issued an administrative complaint in the case in 1985 .
John Christie a lawyer here for the two Chicago Title & Trust units accused the FTC of second-guessing state-level regulations with which he said his clients had complied .
I expect all the companies to appeal he added .
A lawyer for Lawyers Title said that because the named companies no longer use the type of cooperative rating bureaus attacked by the FTC the commission 's order wo n't have much practical impact .
Officials for the other named companies did n't return telephone calls seeking comment .

First they get us to buy computers so we can get more information .
Then the computers give us more information than we can ever read .
Now they plan to sell us products that sift through all the information to give us what we really want to know .
The products range from computer-edited personal newsletters to systems that sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires .
Filtered news is what people want says Esther Dyson editor of Release 1.0 an industry newsletter that spots new developments .
Most people read 10 times more than necessary in order to find out what they really need .
Geoffrey Goodfellow who dropped out of high school back in the 1970s to manage a computer network at a California research firm says Old network hands have started to turn off the network because they do n't have time to wade through the muck .
Mr. Goodfellow has started a Menlo Park Calif. company called Anterior Technology that provides human editors for public electronic networks .
I see it as a sewage treatment plant he says .
A new product NewsEdge carries five business news wires simultaneously into a user 's computer and beeps and flashes whenever an article appears that is of interest to the user .
The product developed by Desktop Data Corp. a new company based in Waltham Mass. scans the wires looking for articles that contain key words specified by the user .
One early user David Semmel a Chicago venture capitalist and investor in Desktop Data says he uses it to track takeover developments .
He says he told NewsEdge to look for stories containing such words as takeover acquisition acquire LBO tender merger junk and halted .
I 'm pretty confident I 'm catching everything he says .
NewsEdge is pricey 7,500 a year for a limited version 40,000 a year if the cost of all the news wires is included .
And it works best in high-powered personal computers .
But some investors and consultants who have tried it are enthusiastic .
Jeffrey Tarter editor of SoftLetter a Watertown Mass. industry newsletter says I 've seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering information .
This is the first time I 've seen something I could imagine a lot of people using .
NewsEdge uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by Reuters McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones & Co. as well as PR Newswire which carries corporate press releases .
An FM receiver attached to a user 's personal computer receives the information .
Some organizations have devised their own systems to sort through news wire items as they come in .
George Goodwin an account manager at Royal Bank of Canada adapted a Lotus Development Corp. program called Agenda to sort through international news wires .
It automatically selects stories from particular countries for reading by the international bankers responsible for lending in those areas .
For those who do n't need their personalized information moment by moment some services are offering overnight newsletters .
Individual Inc. a new company in Brookline Mass. uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton to automatically produce customized newsletters it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m. the next day .
We are operating an information refinery that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge says Yosi Amram founder and president .
The daily newsletter which is n't widely available yet will have a base cost of 2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters McGraw Hill United Press International two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service .
One early user is NEC Corp. 's U.S. printer marketing arm .
They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition Mr. Amram says .
It also tracks personnel and financial announcements by NEC 's distributors and customers .
Individual Inc. 's technology goes beyond word searches by using a computerized thesaurus .
If a customer asks for stories about IBM the computer will also supply stories that mention I.B.M. International Business Machines or Big Blue Mr. Amram says .
Moreover Individual Inc. 's computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber 's interest area .
It compares the position of key words in the story words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value .
And it calculates how often the words appear in the story compared with how often they appear in the entire data base .
The higher the ratio of hits to total words the higher the presumed value to the reader .
Pinpoint Information Corp. Chantilly Va. a producer of 1,800-a-year personalized newsletters about the computer industry that started full operation last month relies on 12 human readers to code news releases by topic in order to select items for each subscriber .
The computers find all the key words they can but the editors confirm every one .
Computer picking is n't perfect says Harvey Golomb president and founder of Pinpoint .
The humans also write abstracts of articles from some 200 computer industry publications .
Once all the articles are coded and put in a data base Pinpoint 's computers pick the most relevant for each subscriber and lay them out in a three-to-five-page newsletter format each newsletter is sent directly from the computer to the subscriber 's fax machine .
