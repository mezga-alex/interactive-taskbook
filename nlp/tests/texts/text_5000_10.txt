Please submit your offers says Felipe Bince Jr .
He surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the Philippine government 's Asset Privatization Trust for the sale of a 36 % interest in the country 's largest paper mill .
The agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than 80 million .
Not a peso is offered .
Mr. Bince the trust 's associate executive trustee declares the bidding a failure .
It 's getting harder to sell he mutters as he leaves the room .
Indeed .
Recently the trust failed to auction off the paper mill a bank an office building and a small cotton-ginning plant .
Of the four only the bank and the plant drew bids one apiece .
In October 1987 President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would get out of business by selling all or part of the state 's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos .
Two years later Mrs. Aquino 's promise remains largely unfulfilled .
October is a critical month for the privatization program .
Manila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged .
In addition the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines the national carrier an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls the bellwether of privatization .
All told there are assets on the line valued at up to 1.03 billion .
The privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds .
Much of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion-dollar agrarian-reform program .
But efforts have been thwarted by official indifference bureaucratic resistance a legal system that operates at a snail 's pace political opposition and government misjudgments .
Most recently a lack of buyers has been added to the list .
Rather than gathering momentum the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets .
The axiom appears to be that the more valuable the asset the harder the privatization process .
You just do n't see a whole lot happening says an international economist .
To be sure the program has n't completely stalled .
The Asset Privatization Trust the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties has recorded sales of more than 500 million since it began functioning in December 1986 .
But its success has been largely in the sale of small nonperforming companies which are valued for their assets .
Dealing with the sales this month could be particularly challenging because almost every problem that has hobbled the program in the past is popping up again .
Ramon Garcia the Asset Trust 's executive trustee admits to what he calls temporary setbacks .
In light of the poor results recently he says the agency is adopting an attitude of flexibility .
October 's troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank Associated Bank for the minimum price of 671 million pesos 31 million .
At the end of the month the agency again will offer the bank .
But instead of a minimum price only a target price will be established .
Bankers say however that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price .
The bank has a negative net worth they say .
In addition special bidding rules give the bank 's former owner Leonardo Ty the right to match the highest bid .
Mr. Ty lost control to the government in 1980 when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash-strapped institution .
In 1983 the loans were converted into equity giving Manil
