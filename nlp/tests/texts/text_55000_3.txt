eem to originate in Newport Beach or one of the other well-heeled communities that surround this sliver-like city that hooks around a point of land on the California coast south of Los Angeles .
In fact sophisticated big-bucks boiler-room scams are known generically among law-enforcement types as Newport Beach operations .
That contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as Hollywood scams .
Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot .
The investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals .
In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses caused by employees due to dishonesty destruction or disappearance according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month .
Thus falsely reassured investors sent 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses the indictment charges .
Douglas Jones an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr. the chairman and president of Capital Trust says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors .
There were some business deals that went bad Mr. Jones says but no intent to defraud .
Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars .
Traditionally boiler rooms operate on the cheap since few if any customers ever visit their offices .
Indeed the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space near the boiler room .
But says Mr. Katz the U.S. attorney the interesting thing about Newport Beach operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices with plush furnishings .
When we go there it 's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses .
The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately .
Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals .
Mr. Valentine who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle an island in Newport 's harbor according to investigators .
With the 3 million received from investors he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits .
It 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas Mr. Katz says .
All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element .
Vincent M Ciavarella regional manager of Property Management Systems insists he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co. the owner and developer of the project .
Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided incomplete financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators are not easily detectable .
Investigators stress that building owners are victims too since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent .
Richard Luehrs president of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce calls boiler rooms a negative we wish we could get rid of .
Actually we do n't get much negative publicity about this he insists except for the press who write about it .

YOU WENT to college and thought you got an education .
Now you discover that you never learned the most important lesson How to send your kids to college .
True when you went to college there was n't that much to learn .
Stick some money in an interest-bearing account and watch it grow .
Now investment salesmen say it 's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your toddler a ticket to Prestige U. in 18 years .
In short throw away the passbook and go for the glory .
The reason is cost .
Nothing in the annals of tuition readied parents for the 1980s .
Tuitions at private colleges rose 154 % in the 10 years ended in June of this year that 's twice the 77 % increase in consumer prices for the same period .
A year at Harvard now goes for 19,395 .
By 2007 when this year 's newborns hit campus a four-year Ivy League sheepskin will cost 300,000 give or take a few pizzas-with-everything at exam time .
Stanford MIT and other utmosts will cost no less .
So what 's a parent to do .
Some investment advisers are suggesting in effect a bet on a start-up investment pool maybe even on margin .
Others prefer deep-discount zero-coupon bonds .
Still others say Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund .
You 're not going to make it in a 5 % bank account says James Riepe director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price .
To get the necessary growth adds Murray Ruffel a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group you need to go to the stock market .
In other words a little volatility never hurt .
It never hurt anyone that is unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to .
Or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid 's tuition .
That 's the dilemma for today 's parent .
Although many experts are advising risk no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off .
Help may be on the way .
The antitrust division of the Justice Department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools .
Fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s .
And then there 's always State U .
But parents ' craving for a top-rated education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine .
Belatedly aware of public concern lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes .
Their message explicit or implicit is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore .
Forget about Treasury bills or a money-market fund .
The latest wave of marketing is instructive .
Several outfits including the Financial Programs Franklin and T. Rowe Price mutual-fund groups and the Edward D. Jones brokerage house are advertising college planner tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly .
The calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of 8 % annually a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one place the stock market .
Most of the mailers are free but Denver-based Financial Programs sells for 15 a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice .
The figures are shocking .
To build a nest egg that would pay for Stanford when a current first-grader reaches college age parents would need to set aside 773.94 a month for 12 years .
They can cut this to 691.09 a month if the investing keeps up through college .
And they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier when mother and child come home from the hospital .
Plugging a cheaper college into the formulas still does n't generate an installment most people can live with .
Using a recent average private-school cost of about 12,500 a year T. Rowe Price 's planner prescribes 450 monthly if the plan begins when the child is six .
Since the formula assumes an 8 % before-tax return in a mutual fund there would also be 16,500 in taxes to pay over the 12 years .
Not everyone is so pessimistic .
People are basically peddling a lot of fear says Arthur Hauptman a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington .
He takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution which reduces most parents ' burden substantially .
Still he says it 's no bad thing if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more .
The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income he says .
That 's crazy .
His advice Do n't panic .
Parents he says should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford .
Half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal he adds .
That way parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition .
Mr. Hauptman reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages .
He favors either an all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds .
In their anxiety however parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes .
They have laid out about 1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bonds so far offered by Connecticut Illinois Virginia and eight other states .
And they have bought about 500 million in prepaid-tuition plans offered in Michigan Florida and Wyoming .
The prepaid plans take payment today usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow .
The baccalaureate bonds tax-free offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity seem to be tailor-made for college savers .
Like other zeros they pay all their interest at maturity meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when Junior graduates from high school .
Their compounding effect is also alluring .
In June Virginia sold bonds for 268.98 that will pay 1,000 in 2009 .
But Richard Anderson head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives at Columbia University a research group partly financed by the federal government says zeros are particularly ill-suited .
Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up .
That wo n't matter if they are held to maturity but if for any reason the parents need to sell them before then there could be a severe loss of principal .
Had zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time aiming for their children 's 1988 enrollment they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years Mr. Anderson figures .
Most other bonds however would probably not have fared much better .
The prepaid plans may be a good bet provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure .
Issuing states generally limit the guarantees to in-state institutions however and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools .
Two private groups are seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval for plans that could be more broadly transferable .
Mr. Anderson wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan .
The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee .
Prepayments much like mutual-fund purchases are pooled for investment .
Sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns .
But buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so .
One problem is that the Internal Revenue Service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable .
The colleges as educational institutions had hoped that would n't be the case .
Based on historical rates of return Mr. Anderson reckons a 100 % stock portfolio indexed to the market would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century .
But sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market .
And they 're leaning more toward fixed income whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases .
I 'm not sure they 're going to make it work says Mr. Anderson .
What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions .
Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack .
Not so Michigan .
Its plan is set up as an independent agency .
The state says there 's no worry investment returns combined with fees and the gains from unused plans will provide all the cash it needs .
Mr. Putka covers education from The Wall Street Journal 's Boston bureau .
If you start saving for your child 's eduction on Jan. 1 1990 here 's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at Yale Notre Dame and University of Minnesota .
Figures assume a 7 % annual rise in tuition fees room and board and an 8 % annual investment return .

AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County Miss. Allen D. Tharp of Isola was one of the best known and most enterprising .
He sold quarter-inch fingerlings to stock other farmers ' ponds and he bought back one-pound-or-so food-fish that he live-hauled to market along with his own whiskery crop .
And he nearly always bought and sold for cash .
Along the way Mr. Tharp omitted a total of 1.5 million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years .
The returns landed in the hands of an Internal Revenue Service criminal investigator Samuel James Baker .
Mr. Baker interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers live-haulers and processors throughout the South before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales in pounds and dollars by Mr. Tharp and others .
Unknown to Mr. Tharp he had fouled his net on a special IRS project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes .
Confronted with the evidence Mr. Tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined 5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison .
He also owes a lot of back taxes interest and civil fraud penalties .
A lot of taxpayers out there are n't as paranoid as one might think .
Federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation on the basis of occupation high income type of income or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or exaggerate deductions .
Many professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters dentists who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised racehorses on their days off .
Mail-order ministers have been squelched .
Now television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny .
The IRS recently won part of its long-running battle with the Church of Scientology over exemptions when the U.S. Supreme Court held that members ' payments to the church were n't deductible because the members received services in return .
IRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers entertainment producers masons roofers and taxi owners .
Small businesses in general account for almost 40 % of unreported personal income the IRS has said .
Once such abuses become so pervasive the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them .
San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula not because IRS agents envy their life styles .
Many openings for mass cheating such as questionable tax shelters and home offices have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them .
Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals .
And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers .
Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony who gets a deduction must report the former spouse 's Social Security number .
Passport applicants now must give Social Security numbers enabling the IRS to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns .
But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention .
In most cases the IRS says these projects are local or regional rather than national and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among say factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses .
The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects according to Marshall V. Washburn deputy assistant commissioner for examination .
Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail but they can make life miserable in other ways for one by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence failure to file a return and the like .
The targeted audit groups include direct sellers people who sell cosmetics housewares and other items door to door or at home parties and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes .
Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips people who engage in large cash transactions and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax .
And now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return and which dependents turn out to be deceased .
Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back .
It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs Mr. Washburn says .
The study provided criteria for singling out returns of potentially noncompliant taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part-time business .
The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill N.J. who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields .
For 1984 they reported gross income of 1,647 from Amway sales offset by expenses totaling 16,746 including car costs of 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of 5,088 .
The Tax Court did n't believe that the Rubins who earned 65,619 in their regular jobs treated the sideline as a real business and derived merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits from it .
The Direct Selling Association a trade group points out that its members which include Amway Corp. cooperate with the IRS to distribute tax-compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject .
The independent-contractor project which began in 1988 involves about 350 IRS agents .
In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 reports Raymond P. Keenan assistant commissioner for collection they examined about 13,000 employers assessed more than 67 million in delinquent employment taxes and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors .
The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions mostly paid by small firms .
Many workers especially professionals want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees ca n't .
But many others who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation become tipsters for the IRS says Jerry Lackey who manages the IRS project 's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando .
Firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't he says .
In his area Mr. Lackey continues the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction doing framing drywall masonry and similar work .
But a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them including physicians and receptionists as independent contractors .
The IRS assessed the clinic 350,000 in back payroll taxes .
It assessed nearly 500,000 against a cruise-ship company that carried about 100 deckhands cooks bartenders entertainers and other employees as self-employed independents .
Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an 80 million computer system in 1985 .
The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses from exchange agreements with the IRS 24 other states and two Canadian provinces and even from phonebook Yellow Pages .
Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer they single out high-income groups looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns .
The state has combed through records relating to architects stockbrokers lawyers in the New York City area construction workers from out of the state and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states especially Florida which has no personal income tax .
Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state doctors dentists and accountants says Frederick G. Hicks director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs .
The department has collected over 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution .
In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns it squeezed 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident .
We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project Mr. Hicks declares .

In finding good news in Berkeley 's new freshman admissions plan The Privileged Class editorial Sept. 20 you 're reading the headline but not the story .
The plan indeed raises from 40 % to 50 % the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria .
But that does n't mean half of the students attending Berkeley will be admitted this way .
The plan is talking about applicants admitted not students who enroll .
Since the yield from this top slice of applicants is relatively low boosting admits from 40 % to 50 % will boost registrants from about 31 % to 38 % of the class .
In addition perhaps 5 % of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials narrowly missed gaining them admission in the first category .
But against that combined increase of 12 % in students chosen by academic criteria the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades test scores and supplemental points for factors such as high-school curriculum English-language proficiency and an essay .
This category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of registrants .
The plan thus will decrease by 22 % for a net loss of 10 % the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria .
Who will take over these places .
The plan creates a new category of students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds a concept not yet defined and gives them about 10 % of the class .
One of the plan 's authors has defended the socioeconomic disadvantage category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race .
Perhaps it does .
But the new category does not replace or reduce Berkeley 's broad racial preferences .
Nor will students from racial-minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative-action target for their group .
The plan thus places a large new affirmative-action program based on socioeconomic disadvantage on top of the existing program based on race .
The role of academic criteria in choosing Berkeley 's freshmen can only decline as a result .

FOR THOSE WHO DELIGHT in the misfortune of others read on .
This is a story about suckers .
Most of us know a sucker .
Many of us are suckers .
But what we may not know is just what makes somebody a sucker .
What makes people blurt out their credit-card numbers to a caller they 've never heard of .
Do they really believe that the number is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to being a grand-prize winner .
What makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door .
Or an interest in a retirement community in Nevada that will knock your socks off once it is built .
Because in the end these people always wind up asking themselves the same question How could I be so stupid .
There are unfortunately plenty of answers to that question and scam artists know all of them .
These people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person tick says Kent Neal chief of the economic-crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney 's Office in Fort Lauderdale Fla. a major haven for boiler rooms .
Once they size them up then they know what buttons to push .
John Blodgett agrees and he ought to know .
He used to be a boiler-room salesman peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins .
There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways he says .
The most obvious pitch of course is the lure of big returns .
We 're all a little greedy .
Everyone is vulnerable says Charles Harper associate regional administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Miami .
These guys prey on human frailties .
While the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells they often do n't in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore .
The overnight success story is part of our culture and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people says Michael Cunningham an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville .
Other people are making it overnight and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along .
Adds Spencer Barasch branch chief for enforcement at the SEC in Fort Worth Texas Why do people play the lottery when the odds are great against them .
People are shooting for a dream .
Clearly though scam artists have to be a bit more subtle than simply promising millions the psychology of suckers is n't simply the psychology of the greedy .
There 's also for instance the need to be part of the in-crowd .
So one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing .
Between 1978 and 1987 for instance SH Oil in Winter Haven Fla. sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents while turning away numerous other eager investors .
The owner of the company Stephen Smith who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office .
Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed the suit alleged .
Such schemes says Tony Adamski chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington D.C. appeal to investors ' desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity .
At times salesmen may embellish the inside information with the notion that this is some slightly shady slightly illegal investment the person is being included in says Mr. Cunningham .
In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others .
It also adds to the mystery of the venture .
Mr. Blodgett the boiler-room veteran believes that for many investors the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement .
Once people got into it I was allowing them to live a dream he says .
He phoned them with updates on the investment such as funny things that happened at the well that week he says .
You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives .
Mr. Blodgett who was convicted in Florida state court of selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive is now on probation .
He says he has quit the business and is back in school majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology .
For some investors it 's the appearances that leave them deceived .
The trappings of success go a long way wearing the right clothes doing the right things says Paul Andreassen an associate professor of psychology at Harvard .
Conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment .
People honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot he says .
Paul Wenz a Phoenix Ariz. attorney says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery .
But Mr. Wenz who says he lost 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and 39,000 in another says a salesman used a business-venture approach with him sending investment literature a contract limiting the firm 's liability and an insurance policy .
When he visited the company 's office he says it had all the trappings of legitimacy .
Still others are stung by a desire to do both well and good says Douglas Watson commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department 's bunko-forgery division .
Born-again Christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do-gooder investment pitches .
But hardly the only ones The scams promise among other things to help save the environment feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children .
Psychologists say isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud .
Scam artists seek out such people or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves .
For instance salesmen may counter a man 's objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking Who wears the pants in your family .
Or an investor who wants his accountant 's advice may be told You seem like a guy who can make up his own mind .
Often con artists will try to disarm their victims by emphasizing similarities between them .
William Lynes a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp. says he and his wife Lily warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from Stuart-James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them he too had once worked with Lockheed .
The Lyneses of Powder Springs Ga. have filed suit in Georgia state court against Stuart James alleging fraud .
They are awaiting an arbitration proceeding .
They say the broker took them out for lunch frequently .
He urged them to refer their friends who also lost money .
Donald Trinen an attorney for the penny-brokerage firm denies the fraud allegations and says the Lyneses were fully apprised that they were pursuing a high-risk investment .
It 's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to ingratiate themselves to their clients says Terree Bowers chief of the major-frauds section of the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles .
We 've seen cases where salesmen will affect the accent of the region of the country they are calling .
Anything to make a sale .
Experts say that whatever a person 's particular weak point timing is crucial .
People may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives .
Sometimes when people are making big changes retiring from their jobs moving to a new area they lose their bearings says Maury Elvekrog a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger-Elvekrog Inc. a Birmingham Mich. investment-counseling firm .
They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time .
They are obviously also more susceptible when they need money retirees for instance trying to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how to pay for a child 's college expenses .
These people are n't necessarily stupid or naive .
Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way says Jerald Jellison a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles .
Nick Cortese thinks that 's what happened to him .
Mr. Cortese a 33-year-old Delta Air Lines engineer invested some 2,000 in penny stocks through a broker who promised quick returns .
We were saving up to buy a house and my wife was pregnant says Mr. Cortese .
It was just before the Christmas holidays and I figured we could use some extra cash .
The investment is worth about 130 today .
Maybe it was just a vulnerable time says Mr. Cortese .
Maybe the next day or even an hour later I would n't have done it .

Prices for seats on the New York Stock Exchange are recovering a bit after hitting a four-year low earlier this month .
Two seats on the Big Board were sold yesterday for 455,000 and then 500,000 .
The previous sale was 436,000 on Oct. 17 the last time prices were that low was November 1985 when a seat sold for 425,000 .
Prices peaked at 1,150,000 in September 1987 .
Seats are currently quoted at 430,000 bid and 525,000 asked .
FOX HUNTING HAS been defined as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible but at least it 's exercise .
At least it has a little dash .
Most of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither drab duties rather than pleasures .
Like trying to buy life insurance for instance an endeavor notably lacking in dash .
Call it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible .
But sooner or later most of us have to think about life insurance just as we often have to think about having root-canal work .
And my time has come .
I 'm 33 married no children and employed in writing stories like this one .
In times past life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household meaning men but ours is a two-income family and accustomed to it .
So if anything happened to me I 'd want to leave behind enough so that my 33-year-old husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts though not I admit enough to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury .
Figuring that maybe 100,000 to 150,000 would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted I looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies and plunged into a jungle of gibberish .
Over the past decade or two while I was thinking about fox hunting the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products variations on products and variations on the variations .
Besides term life and whole life the old standbys we now have universal life universal variable life flexible adjustable universal life policies with persistency bonuses policies festooned with exotic riders living benefit policies and on and on .
What to do .
First generalize .
Shorn of all their riders special provisions and other bells and whistles insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories so-called pure insurance which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death and permanent insurance which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive .
If all you want is death-benefit coverage pure insurance a term policy gives you maximum bang for your buck within limits .
It 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age .
But term means just that the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires .
It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal if you flunk which means you need insurance more than ever you may not be able to buy it .
Even if you 're healthy and can renew your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older .
So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks .
There are all sorts of variations on term insurance policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt term riders tacked on to permanent insurance and many others .
One variation that appealed to me at first was the Money Smart Term Life policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. the American Express unit to the parent company 's credit-card holders .
Upon examination however I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense .
Amex said it would charge me 576 a year for 100,000 of coverage and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years .
Sounds great or does it .
First if I canceled I 'd have no more insurance a not insignificant consideration .
Second the 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation Amex not I would get the benefit of the investment income on my money income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit .
Third and most important Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile .
That would be all right with Amex which could then lock in its investment profit but it does n't add up to a smart money move for me .
Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else There is no free lunch there is only marketing .
And the Second Law unique to insurance .
If I die early I win a hollow victory since I ca n't enjoy it and if I live long the insurer wins .
Always .
This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance the kind that amasses cash value .
The word death can not be escaped entirely by the industry but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms preferring to talk about savings and investment instead .
The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature .
That is gilding the lily .
The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into .
That 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package .
Again no free lunch .
This is reflected in a built-in mortality cost in effect your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection .
And in most cases a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is in effect paying the salesman 's commission as well investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years largely because of this .
So view permanent insurance for what it is a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment .
The simplest most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy .
You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing and your cash value and dividends grow over the years .
One newer wrinkle so called single-premium life you pay for the whole policy at once has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy loans and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment .
Congress closed this loophole last year or thought it did .
However Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield Mass. has developed a combination plan of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences .
But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small .
I 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately so I look into the broad category called universal life .
Hugely popular it is far more flexible than straight whole life .
I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy .
In looking at these and other policies I learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into policy illustrations the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years .
They commonly give two scenarios One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees usually 4 % to 4.5 % and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment often 8.5 % or more .
Projecting the latter over several decades I find my cash buildup is impressive but can any high interest rate prevail for that long .
Not likely I think .
Also some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year .
These are not certain either .
Companies are n't comfortable playing these games but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good says Timothy Pfiefer an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast a unit of Towers Perrin Co. the big New York consulting firm .
Another factor to consider Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately .
There are seemingly endless twists to universal life and it pays to ask questions about all of them .
At a back-yard barbecue for example a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be guaranteed .
I call her agent David Dominici .
Yes he says premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to vanish after a certain period but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection .
If interest rates plunge the insurer may be knocking on my door asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection .
I do n't like the sound of that .
Some insurers have also started offering persistency bonuses such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield if the policy is maintained for 10 years .
But Glenn Daily a New York-based financial consultant warns that many of these bonuses are just fantasies because most are n't guaranteed by the companies .
And the feature is so new he adds that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments .
So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection .
Offered by insurers that include Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. Jackson National Life Insurance Co. and National Travelers Life Insurance Co. these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive .
Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer heart attarcks renal failure and kidney transplants .
But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined vary from policy to policy and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance .
Also financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes .
And considering the extra cost of such provisions some figure that people interested in say paying for extended nursing-home care would be better off just buying a separate policy that provides it .
I 'm more favorably impressed by no-load life even though it turns out to be low-load life .
Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen there is still a load annual administrative fees and initial setup charges but I figure that the lack of commission and of surrender fees for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot .
I compared one universal policy for 130,000 face amount from such an insurer American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln Neb. with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen .
After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with 792 but get only 14 from the Equitable .
The difference is magnified by time too .
At age 65 when I 'd stop paying premiums the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value 14,000 higher than the other even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate .
Did I buy it .
Well not yet .
I 'm thinking about using the 871 annual premium to finance a trip to Paris first .
A person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it .
Rorer Group Inc. will report that third-quarter profit rose more than 15 % from a year earlier though the gain is wholly due to asset sales Robert Cawthorn chairman president and chief executive officer said .
His projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than 17.4 million or 55 cents a share compared with 15.2 million or 48 cents a share a year ago .
Mr. Cawthorn said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of somewhat less than 10 % .
Through the first six months of 1989 sales had grown about 12 % from the year-earlier period .
Growth of 10 % would make sales for the latest quarter 269 million compared with 244.6 million a year ago .
Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs .
Asilone an antacid was sold to Boots PLC London .
Thrombinar a drug used to stanch bleeding was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. St. Louis .
He said Rorer sold the drugs for nice prices and will record a combined pretax gain on the sales of 20 million .
As the gain from the sales indicates operating profit was significantly below the year-earlier level Mr. Cawthorn said .
Rorer in July had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989 .
He said the company is still looking for a strong fourth quarter in all areas sales operating income and net income .
Mr. Cawthorn attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars to accelerated buying of Rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending July 1 price increase and to higher marketing expenses for Rorer 's Maalox antacid whose sales and market share in the U.S. had slipped in the first half of 1989 .
He said Rorer opted to sell Asilone and Thrombinar to raise revenue that would kick start its increased marketing efforts behind Maalox still its top-selling product with about 215 million in world-wide sales in 1988 .
We had underfunded Maalox for a year he said because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs .
He said Rorer will spend 15 million to 20 million more on Maalox advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period .
A big chunk of that additional spending came in the third quarter he said .
Hoechst AG said it will stop producing fertilizer in 1990 because of continued losses and a bleak outlook .
The West German chemical concern said it will close the last remaining fertilizer plant in Oberhausen in the fall of next year .
Hoechst said the fertilizer market faces overcapacity in Western Europe rising imports from East bloc countries and overseas and declining demand .
HomeFed Corp. said its main subsidiary Home Federal Savings & Loan converted from a federal savings and loan to a federal savings bank and changed its name to HomeFed Bank .
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision approved the conversion last Friday HomeFed said .
The change in charter does n't alter the federal insurance of deposits federal regulatory powers or company operations a spokesman said .

The industrials were up about 60 points in the afternoon but cautious investors took profits before the close .
Traders said a variety of factors triggered the rally .
The consumer price index rose 0.2 % in September while many economists were looking for a 0.4 % increase .
Stock-index arbitrage buy programs in which traders buy stock against offsetting positions in futures to lock in price differences helped the rally 's momentum .
The euphoria was such that investors responded to good earnings reports of companies such as American Express while ignoring the disappointing profits of companies such as Caterpillar analysts said .
Stock-index arbitrage trading was a minor influence in yesterday 's rally traders said .
Institutional buyers were the main force pushing blue chips higher .
To the amazement of some traders takeover stocks were climbing again .
Hilton rose 2 7\/8 to 100 for example .

The announcement of the buy-out 's troubles triggered the market 's nose dive a week ago .
Takeover enthusiasm may have been renewed when an investor group disclosed yesterday that it had obtained all the financing required to complete its 1.6 billion leveraged buy-out of American Medical International .
That 's put some oomph back into this market said Peter VandenBerg a vice president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton .
But some traders thought there was less to the rally than met the eye .
There is no strength behind this rally asserted Chung Lew head trader at Kleinwort Benson North America .
It 's traders squaring positions .
It 's not good the market is setting up for another fall .
Indeed many traders said that uncertainty about today 's monthly expiration of stocks-index futures and options and options on individual stocks prompted a lot of buying by speculative traders who were unwinding positions that were bets on declining stock prices .
