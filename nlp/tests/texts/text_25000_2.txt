Please submit your offers says Felipe Bince Jr .
He surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the Philippine government 's Asset Privatization Trust for the sale of a 36 % interest in the country 's largest paper mill .
The agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than 80 million .
Not a peso is offered .
Mr. Bince the trust 's associate executive trustee declares the bidding a failure .
It 's getting harder to sell he mutters as he leaves the room .
Indeed .
Recently the trust failed to auction off the paper mill a bank an office building and a small cotton-ginning plant .
Of the four only the bank and the plant drew bids one apiece .
In October 1987 President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would get out of business by selling all or part of the state 's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos .
Two years later Mrs. Aquino 's promise remains largely unfulfilled .
October is a critical month for the privatization program .
Manila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged .
In addition the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines the national carrier an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls the bellwether of privatization .
All told there are assets on the line valued at up to 1.03 billion .
The privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds .
Much of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion-dollar agrarian-reform program .
But efforts have been thwarted by official indifference bureaucratic resistance a legal system that operates at a snail 's pace political opposition and government misjudgments .
Most recently a lack of buyers has been added to the list .
Rather than gathering momentum the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets .
The axiom appears to be that the more valuable the asset the harder the privatization process .
You just do n't see a whole lot happening says an international economist .
To be sure the program has n't completely stalled .
The Asset Privatization Trust the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties has recorded sales of more than 500 million since it began functioning in December 1986 .
But its success has been largely in the sale of small nonperforming companies which are valued for their assets .
Dealing with the sales this month could be particularly challenging because almost every problem that has hobbled the program in the past is popping up again .
Ramon Garcia the Asset Trust 's executive trustee admits to what he calls temporary setbacks .
In light of the poor results recently he says the agency is adopting an attitude of flexibility .
October 's troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank Associated Bank for the minimum price of 671 million pesos 31 million .
At the end of the month the agency again will offer the bank .
But instead of a minimum price only a target price will be established .
Bankers say however that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price .
The bank has a negative net worth they say .
In addition special bidding rules give the bank 's former owner Leonardo Ty the right to match the highest bid .
Mr. Ty lost control to the government in 1980 when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash-strapped institution .
In 1983 the loans were converted into equity giving Manila 98 % of the bank but with the understanding that Mr. Ty had repurchase rights .
His ability to match any bid has scared off many potential buyers .
Separately the government will try again within a month to sell the 36 % stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines or Picop as the paper mill is known .
The price will depend on how much Picop shares fetch on the local stock market .
But according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill price is n't the only consideration .
As it stands now the government would continue to hold 45 % of Picop after the 36 % stake is sold .
About 7.5 % of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity .
Potential buyers mostly foreign companies are reluctant to take a non-controlling stake in a company that by the government 's own reckoning needs some 100 million in new capital for rehabilitation .
The prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers including a member of the Elders group of Australia to pull out of the bidding the bankers and analysts say .
Mr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer .
Under government regulations however foreign ownership of Picop 's equity is limited to 40 % .
Even though the government would retain the 45 % stake in Picop critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners .
A series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short-changing the government over the Picop sale .
Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale both prompted by the criticism of the agency .
The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines in which it has a 99 % stake .
The carrier has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed .
This maker of electronic measuring devices named two new directors increasing board membership to nine .

Eagle Financial Corp. and Webster Financial Corp. two Connecticut savings bank-holding companies agreed to merge in a tax-free stock transaction .
The new holding company Webster\/Eagle Bancorp Inc. will have about 1.2 billion of assets and 19 banking offices in Connecticut .
Tangible capital will be about 115 million .
The merger is subject to regulatory clearance and a definitive agreement .
In the merger each share of Webster based in Waterbury will be converted into one share of the new company .
Each share of Eagle based in Bristol will become 0.95 share of Webster\/Eagle .
In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday Eagle shares rose 12.5 cents to 11 .
In national over-the-counter trading Webster shares fell 25 cents to 12.375 .
Webster has 3.5 million shares outstanding and Eagle 2.6 million .
Their indicated market values thus are about 43.3 million and 28.6 million respectively .
Frank J. Pascale chairman of Eagle will be chairman of the new firm and James C. Smith president and chief executive officer of Webster will take those posts at Webster\/Eagle .
Harold W. Smith Sr. chairman of Webster will become chairman emeritus and a director of the new company .
Ralph T. Linsley vice chairman of Eagle will become vice chairman of Webster\/Eagle .
The board will be made up of seven directors of each holding company .
In an interview James Smith said the banks ' markets are contiguous and their business philosophies are similar and conservative .
Nonperforming loans will make up only about 0.5 % of the combined banks ' total loans outstanding he said .
At June 30 Webster which owns First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Waterbury had assets of 699 million .
Eagle which controls Bristol Federal Savings Bank and First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Torrington had assets of 469.6 million on that date .
Guillermo Ortiz 's Sept. 15 Americas column Mexico 's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug is a refreshingly clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well .
The Mexico-United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as Mexico 's undersecretary of finance view his country 's reforms in the context of a larger world-wide process of profound change toward free-market economics especially in the statist countries .
Having said that we must caution against an apparent tendency to overstate the case .
It is not quite true for example that the Mexican government has privatized Mexicana de Aviacion as Mr. Ortiz claims .
In the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40 % of the total equity of the airline .
How can a company be considered privatized if the state is so heavily represented in it .
True the Mexican government has granted control over the airline to a new private consortium but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine .
Regrettably too Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar numbers game when he boasts that fewer than 392 state enterprises currently remain in the public sector down from the 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982 .
But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico indeed they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure .
I refer essentially to petroleum electric power banking and newsprint .
Those enterprises however are not going to be privatized .
They are officially considered strategic and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution .
In language that sidesteps the issue Mr. Ortiz writes The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas 's plan to modernize Mexico 's economy .
Yet clearly modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said to have caught the privatization bug .
The bottom line however is not economic but political reform .
A long succession of Mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to without having to answer to the public .
To guarantee that Mexicana de Aviacion and other companies will really be privatized Mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability .
Daniel James President Mexico-United States Institute The board of this Ponce Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter .

Ponce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 .
A labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands according to people familiar with the group .
The group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of 225 to 240 a share or 5.09 billion to 5.42 billion .
But to avoid the risk of rejection the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a UAL board meeting today .
Instead the group is raising the proposal informally to try to test the board 's reaction .
People familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the 300-a-share 6.79 billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner British Airways PLC dropped out .
In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange UAL closed at 168.50 a share down 21.625 .
But the pilots union which has been pushing for a takeover since 1987 appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner to replace British Air .
Although the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks it believes bank financing could be obtained .
After the collapse of the last effort the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without binding commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed .
Under the type of transaction being discussed the pilot-management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders .
Those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company .
For example the group could offer 200 a share in cash plus stock valued at 30 a share .
UAL currently has 22.6 million shares fully diluted .
The new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest .
The difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control .
The failed takeover would have given UAL employees 75 % voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline with management getting 10 % control and British Air 15 % .
It was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan but employees would keep more than 50 % .
Management 's total could be reduced and the public could get more than the 15 % control that had been earmarked for British Air .
One option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period .
Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort at least temporarily and to return to running the company full time .
The board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale .
The labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board .
However the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis who triggered the buy-out with a 5.4 billion bid in early August is hanging back apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse .
Three top advisers to Mr. Davis visited New York late last week at least in part to confer with executives at Citicorp .
Mr. Davis had paid 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid .
But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group .
On Friday British Air issued a statement saying it does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future .
However several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out .
Also late last week UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer .
But the machinists union whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor .
One advantage the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make 200 million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid .
Speculation has also arisen that the UAL executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing chief financial officer John Pope may come under pressure to resign .
However people familiar with the buy-out group said Mr. Pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time .
Despite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing UAL remains obligated to pay 26.7 million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers Lazard Freres & Co. Salomon Brothers Inc. and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .

A REVISED BID FOR UAL is being prepared by a labor-management group sources said .
