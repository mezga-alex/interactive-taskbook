 Ky. also reported favorable results with net income of 66.7 million or 66 cents in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 up from 58.2 million or 59 cents a year earlier .
Analysts say the handful of hospital companies that are still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends .
Most important hospital admission rates are stabilizing after several years of decline .
Moreover companies have sold off many of their smaller less-profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings .
Humana 's revenues for example are being boosted by large increases in enrollments in the company 's health maintenance organizations .
Says Todd Richter an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds The shakeout in the publicly traded companies is over .
Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 396,000 during the week ended Oct. 7 from 334,000 the previous week the Labor Department said .
The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 or 2.2 % of those covered by unemployment insurance from 2,205,000 the previous week when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2 % .
Counting all state and federal benefit programs the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier .
These figures are n't seasonally adjusted .
A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states particularly North Carolina and South Carolina .
The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits the official said .
Digital Equipment Corp. reported a 32 % decline in net income on a modest revenue gain in its fiscal first quarter causing some analysts to predict weaker results ahead than they had expected .
Although the second-largest computer maker had prepared Wall Street for a poor quarter analysts said they were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders .
The Maynard Mass. company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on mid-range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes .
Net for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to 150.8 million or 1.20 a share from 223 million or 1.71 a share a year ago .
Revenue rose 6.4 % to 3.13 billion from 2.94 billion .
Digital said a shift in its product mix toward low-end products and strong growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins .
A spokesman also said margins for the company 's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector .
The lack of a strong product at the high end of Digital 's line was a significant drag on sales .
Digital hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe-class computers next Tuesday .
The new line is aimed directly at International Business Machines Corp .
Until the new mainframe products kick in there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end and that 's hurt us said Mark Steinkrauss Digital 's director of investor relations .
He said unfavorable currency translations were also a factor in the quarter .
DEC shares rose 1.375 to 89.75 apiece in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday .
But analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly 40-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength .
Some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead .
I think the next few quarters will be difficult said Steven Milunovich of First Boston .
Margins will remain under pressure and when the new mainframe does ship I 'm not sure it will be a big winner .
Mr. Milunovich said he was revising his estimate for DEC 's current year from 8.20 a share to well below 8 although he has n't settled on a final number .
One troubling aspect of DEC 's results analysts said was its performance in Europe .
DEC said its overseas business which now accounts for more than half of sales improved in the quarter .
It even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in Europe were up in double digits in foreign-currency terms .
That gain probably translated into about 5 % to 7 % in dollar terms well below recent quarters ' gains of above 20 % reckons Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds .
That was a disappointment and a sign of overall computer-market softness in Europe Mr. Stevens said .
Marc Schulman with UBS Securities in New York dropped his estimate of DEC 's full-year net to 6.80 a share from 8 .
Although overall revenues were stronger Mr. Schulman said DEC drew down its European backlog and had flat world-wide orders overall .
The bottom line is that it 's more hand to mouth than it has been before he said .
Mr. Schulman said he believes that the roll-out of DEC 's new mainframe will occur somewhat more leisurely than many of his investment colleagues expect .
He said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in December with all of the more sophisticated versions out by June .
For reasons he would n't elaborate on he said he 's sure that schedule wo n't be met meaning less profit impact from the product for DEC in the next few quarters .

Colgate Palmolive Co. reported third-quarter net income rose 27 % bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from U.S. operations .
Colgate said net income for the quarter rose to 76.7 million or 1.06 a share on sales that increased 6 % to 1.3 billion .
In the year-earlier period Colgate posted net income of 60.2 million or 88 cents a share .
Last year 's results included earnings from discontinued operations of 13.1 million or 19 cents a share .
Reuben Mark chairman and chief executive officer of Colgate said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in Latin America the Far East and Europe .
Results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. business he said .
Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal care businesses which include such well-known brands as Colgate toothpaste and Fab laundry detergent jumped more than 40 % the company said .
Mr. Mark attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities .
We 've done a lot to improve U.S. .
results and a lot more will be done Mr. Mark said .
Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company .
Colgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts .
The scope of the improvement in the U.S. business caught some analysts by surprise .
The company 's domestic business especially its household products division has performed poorly for years .
Analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales .
For the nine months net increased 14 % to 217.5 million or 3.09 a share .
Sales rose 7 % to 3.8 billion .
The company earned 191.1 million or 2.79 a share in the year-earlier period .
Colgate 's 1988 net income included 40.1 million or 59 cents a share from discontinued operations .
Colgate sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year .
Separately Colgate Wednesday finalized an agreement with MacroChem Corp. a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in Billerica Mass. to market in the U.S. four of MacroChem 's FDA-approved dental products .
The products sealants and bonding materials used by dentists all contain fluoride that is released over time .
The move is part of a drive to increase Colgate 's business with dentists a company spokeswoman said .
Terms of the agreement were n't given .
USACafes Limited Partnership said it completed the sale of its Bonanza restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of Metromedia Co. for 71 million in cash .
USACafes which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible .
The Bonanza franchise system which generates about 600 million in sales annually represented substantially all of the partnership 's assets .
The sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a Delaware court USACafes said .
The company said it believes the suit is without merit .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes will enable it to save 450 million in the next year .
AT&T also said net income rose 19 % in the third quarter .
AT&T said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments .
AT&T said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program .
AT&T said third-quarter net income grew despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets .
Net income rose to 699 million or 65 cents a share from the year-earlier 587 million or 55 cents a share .
Revenue edged up to 8.9 billion from 8.81 billion .
The latest period 's net was reduced 102 million or nine cents a share for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment .
The results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts who were encouraged by AT&T increasing its operating margin to 13 % from 11 % a year ago because of continued cost-cutting efforts .
Sales of long-distance services an extremely competitive market rose 6.4 % .
But the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products .
Under the amended pension program AT&T managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes .
Managers who retire Dec. 30 will have an additional 15 % added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65 whichever comes earlier .
An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees .
Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months .
This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth said Jack Grubman an analyst with PaineWebber Inc .
But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth .
This is a good move but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are in terms of earnings growth said Joel D. Gross an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette .
Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts it expects in the future .
AT&T said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses .
But the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire .
AT&T said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in Ing .
C. Olivetti & Co. for shares in Cie .
Industriali Riunite an Italian holding company .
For the nine months AT&T said net income was 1.99 billion or 1.85 a share up 19 % from 1.67 billion or 1.56 a share .
Revenue gained 3.1 % to 26.81 billion from 26 billion .
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange AT&T shares closed at 43.375 up 87.5 cents .
When it comes to buying and selling shares Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one .
Every dollar 's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year the firm estimates .
That makes it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
But wait a second .
Westridge Capital is an index fund the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average .
Westridge Capital 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing .
Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer such as Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index and match its performance .
Institutional investors have poured 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns .
These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few active stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers much less beat it .
And the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each 100 of assets a fraction of the cost of active managers .
That 's because computers do most of the work and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs .
But today indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one .
Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average they have developed enhanced indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points .
Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade but the index money has been just sort of sitting there says Seth M. Lynn president of Axe Core Investors Inc. an indexer based in Tarrytown N.Y .
Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money .
Among the souped-up indexing strategies Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks or just a few dozen rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies .
They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks such as smaller companies those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry state or country .
With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 .
Futures and options also make it possible to build synthetic index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market .
One reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing particularly for those plain vanilla funds that mirror the
