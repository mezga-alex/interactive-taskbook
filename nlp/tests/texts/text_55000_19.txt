er scale was 50 miles to the south near Santa Cruz but its terrible fist struck here on the Nimitz Freeway a major artery serving the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco .
Along the way the quake toppled a mall in Santa Cruz knocked down buildings in San Francisco 's fashionable Marina District and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city 's Financial District .
Just a short span across the bay to the west the quake also showed its mettle A four-square-block area of the Marina District lies smoldering under a steady stream of seawater being pumped onto rubble to prevent it from blazing anew .
Many of the buildings mostly condominiums and apartments were flattened almost instantly as the underlying soil much of it landfill was literally turned to ooze by the quake 's intensive shaking rupturing gas lines .
Onlookers say three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fireball shortly after the quake struck .
Efforts to fight the blaze were hampered because water mains were severed as well .
From the air ribbons of yellow fire hose carry water from the bay to high-pressure nozzles trained on the site .
As onlookers stand behind barricades helmeted firemen and building inspectors survey rows of nearby buildings that were twisted from their foundations and seem on the verge of collapse .
In the Marina District residents spent yesterday assessing damage cleaning up and trying to find friends and neighbors .
Evelyn Boccone 85 years old has lived in the district most of her life .
Her parents lost everything in the 1906 earthquake .
Now we realize what our mothers must have gone through she says .
We always heard about the earthquake but as children we did n't always listen .

An article in the World Business Report of Sept. 22 editions incorrectly referred to his father Grand Duke Jean as the crown prince .
Resolution Funding Corp. plans to sell 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday in the agency 's first sale of securities .
The new bonds will be dated Oct. 30 and mature Oct. 15 2019 .
Tenders for the bonds available in minimum denominations of 1,000 must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Wednesday at Federal Reserve banks .
Refcorp created by the thrift-overhaul law enacted in August will use the proceeds to merge or sell off ailing savings-and-loan institutions .
Congress authorized 50 billion to be borrowed to pay for the thrift bailout .
Of that amount 20 billion has already been borrowed by the Treasury Department .
Unless otherwise specified in a particular offer the bonds wo n't be subject to redemption prior to maturity .
Interest payments on the bonds will be payable semiannually .
The bonds are subject to federal taxation in the U.S. including income taxes .
At the state and local level the bonds are subject to surtaxes and estate inheritance and gift taxes but exempt from taxation as to principal and interest .
G.D. Searle & Co. a Monsanto Co. unit is launching a program to give consumers more information about its drugs when doctors prescribe them .
Called Patients in the Know the program features fact sheets designed to be easy to understand .
The sheets tell how the medicine works describe how to use it and list its possible side effects .
They are designed to be given to patients by their doctors when the medicines are prescribed and include space for the doctor to write special instructions .
In addition Searle will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores .
Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients .
We believe that every drug that 's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label said Douglas Teich of the Public Citizen Health Research Group a Ralph Nader affiliate .
Dr. Teich said Searle is the only company I know that voluntarily will make consumer information available .
According to federal officials and drug-industry studies nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year are n't used properly meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication .
We think it 's very important to provide as much information as possible on the drugs consumers take said Searle Chairman Sheldon Gilgore .
Bond prices rambled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply .
Early yesterday bonds rose as investors rushed to buy Treasury securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive California earthquake .
For example some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies which face massive damage claims would get hit hard .
But when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose instead bonds drifted lower .
With stocks not a major focus we 're waiting for the next guiding light said Brian J. Fabbri chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities Inc .
If the stock market tremors are behind us then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine where interest rates are heading .
The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond which jumped 3\/8 point or about 3.75 for each 1,000 face amount during the first hour of trading ended little changed .
Interest rates barely budged from Tuesday 's levels .
Most junk bonds which have been battered in recent weeks continued a slow recuperation and ended unchanged to slightly higher .
But some so-called high-quality junk issues fell as some mutual funds sold their most liquid issues to raise cash .
RJR Holdings Capital Corp. 's 14.7 % bonds due 2009 fell one point .
Other RJR issues fell between 1\/2 point and 1 1\/2 point .
In the latest sign of how difficult it is to place certain junk bonds Continental Airlines said it was forced to scale back the size of its latest offering .
Continental a unit of Texas Air Corp. slashed the size of its note offering from 150 million to 71 million .
The move had been widely expected .
In the multipart offering the company sold a portion of secured notes but shelved all the unsecured notes .
A Continental spokeswoman said the notes may be offered at a later date .
This was not a do-or-die deal she said .
I think this is a market that required some level of security .
It did not make sense to offer unsecured paper in an unsettling market .
Investors have been speculating for weeks about the market 's ability to place the 7 billion to 10 billion of new junk bonds scheduled to be sold by year end .
Supply troubles were also on the minds of Treasury investors yesterday who worried about the flood of new government securities coming next week .
We 're being bombarded by new Treasury and agency debt offerings said William Sullivan Jr. director of money-market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .
The market is concerned about its ability to underwrite all this debt at current levels .
In addition to the 15.6 billion of Treasury bills to be sold at next week 's regular Monday auction the government will sell 10 billion of new two-year Treasury notes .
And Resolution Funding Corp. said late yesterday that it will sell 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday .
Refcorp is the financing unit of Resolution Trust Corp. a new government agency created to rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts .
Its securities have been dubbed bailout bonds by traders .
In when-issued trading the two-year Treasurys had a yield of about 7.88 % .
In the municipal market all eyes were on California debt as investors tried to gauge the financial ramifications of Tuesday 's earthquake .
But traders said the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of California state and local municipal debt .
There are certain bonds traders refer to as earthquake bonds because the issuers are on top of the San Andreas fault said Zane Mann editor of the California Municipal Bond Advisor a newsletter for investors .
Since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield an extra premium for the earthquake risk they were n't materially affected .
But some bond market analysts said that could quickly change if property casualty insurance companies scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise cash to pay damage claims .
Insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct San Francisco said Charles Lieberman chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp .
He also expects the performance of municipals to lag Treasurys as California is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities .
A report issued late yesterday by Standard & Poor 's Corp. concluded the quake wo n't cause wide-scale credit deterioration for issuers and debt issues in the 12-county area of Northern California affected by the quake .
Treasury Securities Treasury bonds ended narrowly mixed in quiet trading .
The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 100 29\/32 to yield 8.03 % compared with 100 28\/32 to yield 8.04 % Tuesday .
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at a price of 99 26\/32 to yield 8 % compared with 99 25\/32 to yield 8.01 % .
Short-term rates were little changed .
Corporate Issues Investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1\/4 point lower .
The Continental junk bond offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was the only new issue priced yesterday .
In the four-part offering the 71 million of secured equipment certificates was priced to yield 13.75 % to 15.75 % .
Municipals Municipal bonds ended about 1\/8 to 3\/8 point lower hurt by the circulation of two bid-wanted lists totaling 655 million .
Chemical Securities Inc. is acting as agent for the seller .
Meanwhile some California issues were down a touch more than the broad market but traders said there had n't been much investor selling because of the quake .
But New York City general obligation bonds came under selling pressure .
Traders said a steady stream of bonds was put up for sale yesterday pushing yields for longer maturities up 0.05 percentage point .
Traders said investors were reacting to recent negative news on the city 's finances and are nervous ahead of the Nov. 7 election .
Washington D.C. topped the competitive slate yesterday with a sale of 200 million of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes .
In late trading New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was off 1\/4 point at 98 bid .
The yield was 7.35 % up 0.01 percentage point .
Mortgage-Backed Securities Mortgage securities ended little changed after light dealings .
There was no appreciable market impact from the California earthquake .
Dealers said there was some concern that insurance companies might be forced to sell mortgage securities to help pay earthquake-related claims but no selling materialized .
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage Association two dominant issuers of mortgage securities have a sizable amount of California home loans in their mortgagebacked pools .
But their potential quake exposure is seen as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans they purchase .
And because Northern California home prices are so high loans from the region often are too large to be included in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae pools .
Meanwhile Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery ended at 97 29\/32 unchanged .
Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 4\/32 down 1\/32 .
In derivative markets Fannie Mae issued two 400 million real estate mortgage investment conduits backed by its 9 % securities .
Foreign Bonds British government bonds or gilts ended moderately lower as equities there recovered from Tuesday 's drop .
The Treasury 's 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 fell 11\/32 to 111 31\/32 to yield 10.08 % while the 12 % notes due 1995 were down 7\/32 to 103 22\/32 to yield 11.04 % .
Traders said today may be an anxious day for the market .
Several key economic figures are due out and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson is scheduled to give the annual Mansion House address to the financial community .
The chancellor sometimes has used the occasion to announce major economic policy changes .
Economists do n't expect any such changes in this year 's address given Mr. Lawson 's apparent reluctance to adjust policy currently .
Meanwhile Japanese government bonds retreated in quiet trading stymied by the dollar 's resiliency .
Japan 's bellwether 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at 95.75 to yield 5.315 % .
In West Germany investors stayed on the sidelines as the bond market searched for direction .
The government 's 7 % issue due October 1999 fell 0.05 point to 99.90 to yield 7.01 % .
The Berlin Wall still stands .
But the man who built it has fallen .
East Germany yesterday removed Erich Honecker one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens .
But while it was a move that stunned the East bloc it hardly ushers in an era of reform at least anytime soon .
For the Politburo replaced Mr. Honecker who had led East Germany for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus with a man cut of the same cloth Egon Krenz the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime Honecker protege .
East Germany it is clear is no Poland where the Communist Party now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union .
Nor is it a Hungary where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the Communist nation into a multiparty democracy .
Still any change in East Germany has enormous implications for both East and West .
It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow Washington and Western Europe .
Mr. Krenz 52 was named the new party chief just minutes after the Party 's 163-member Central Committee convened in East Berlin .
Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for health reasons West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday .
Mr. Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media .
ADN said Mr. Honecker a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military .
Mr. Krenz is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation 's parliament convenes later this week .
Mr. Honecker 's ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron-handed leadership during which Mr. Honecker now 77 years old built East Germany into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc .
His grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his countrymen dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule fled to the West .
Thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in East Germany 's largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers ' uprising in 1953 .
In Washington the Bush administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change .
The official line was to offer warmer ties to Mr. Krenz provided he is willing to institute reforms .
But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer .
President Bush told reporters Whether that the leadership change reflects a change in East-West relations I do n't think so .
Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker .
One top U.S. expert on East Germany added There is no clear-cut champion of reform that we know of in the East German leadership .
Indeed Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups .
He said while dialogue is important enough forums already exist in which different interests can express themselves .
The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party .
According to West German government sources Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change .
But with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity Mr. Honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle officials say .
Those allies included Politburo members Guenter Mittag who has long headed economic affairs and Joachim Hermann chief of information policy .
Both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday .
Although other resignations may follow it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change .
Clearly the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz .
Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland he was eight years old when World War II ended .
Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany 's division .
Since joining the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member Mr. Krenz had acquired the nickname crown prince a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. Honecker .
In fact the two men have had strikingly similar career paths both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position .
Moreover both men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy .
Notably one of Mr. Krenz 's few official visits overseas came a few months ago when he visited China after the massacre in Beijing .
He later defended the Chinese government 's response during a separate visit to West Germany .
East German Protestantism in particular fears Mr. Krenz in part because of an incident in January 1988 when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who had sought refuge in the Church .
However Mr. Krenz also has a reputation for being politically savvy .
His shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in East Germany is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor Mr. Honecker .
Indeed according to West German government sources he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled Mr. Honecker .
In recent days Mr. Krenz has sought to project a kinder image .
According to a report widely circulating in East Berlin it was Mr. Krenz who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in Leipzig .
He does n't want to have the image of the gun man says Fred Oldenburg an expert at the Bonn-sponsored Institute of East European and International Studies in Cologne .
He 's not a reformer he wants to have the image of a reformer .
As part of his image polishing Mr. Krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party 's authority .
Besides sacking other senior Politburo officials who allied themselves with Mr. Honecker Mr. Krenz could loosen controls on the news media free up travel restrictions and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups .
But will it be enough .
West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful .
He does n't signify what people want so the unrest will go on Mr. Oldenburg predicts .
At the same time the expectations of the East German people are great and will continue to grow .
Says one West German official What 's necessary now is the process of democratization .
Not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously .
Chancellor Kohl meanwhile has invited Mr. Krenz to open discussions with Bonn on a wide range of subjects .
Reports in the West German press citing sources in East Germany suggest Mr. Krenz may serve only as a bridge between Mr. Honecker and a genuine reform leader .
Adding to that speculation is Mr. Krenz 's reputation as a heavy drinker who is said to also suffer from diabetes .
This is a dynamic process and we 're experiencing the first step the Bonn official adds .
The selection of Mr. Krenz may also disappoint Moscow .
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has pressed hard for a change in East Germany 's rigid stance .
Two reform-minded party leaders favored by Moscow as possible successors to Mr. Honecker Dresden party secretary Hans Modrow and Politburo member Guenter Schabowski were passed over .
If Mr. Krenz sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the Soviet Union could intensify .
In Moscow Mr. Gorbachev sent Mr. Krenz a congratulatory telegram that appeared to urge the new leadership to heed growing calls for change .
According to the Soviet news agency Tass Gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany being sensitive to the demands of the time will find solutions to complicated problems the GDR German Democratic Republic encountered .
A force of younger pro-Gorbachev members in the East German bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country .
The older generation has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they did n't .
From the perspective of East Germany 's old guard reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their country 's reason for being .
Unlike the other nations of the bloc East Germany is a creature of the Cold War .
Erasing the differences still dividing Europe and the vast international reordering that implies wo n't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary .
But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map .
Which is what the Old Guard fears .
I 'm sure they 'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR 's future as a separately identifiable state says Michael Simmons a British journalist whose book on East Germany entitled The Unloved Country was published this month .
Up to now that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader Walter Ulbricht to establish the country 's international legitimacy followed by Mr. Honecker 's campaign to build the East bloc 's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise .
Neither man achieved perfection .
Early in 1987 Mr. Honecker and his team stopped paying thin compliments to Mr. Gorbachev and joined with Romania in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems .
The less-self-confident Czechoslovaks and Bulgarians in contrast declared their intentions to reform while doing nothing concrete about it .
The East German media soon began presenting Mr. Gorbachev 's speeches only as sketchy summaries and giving space to his opponents .
By late 1988 they were banning Soviet publications .
The country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road .
Mr. Honecker spoke of generally valid objective laws of socialism and left no room for debate .
With this year 's dislocations in China and the Soviet Union and the drive to democracy in Poland and Hungary the East German leadership grew still more defensive .
Politburo member Joachim Herrman confessed to a grave concern over Hungarian democracy .
Under the banner that proclaims the renewal of socialism he said forces are at work that are striving to eliminate socialism .
Some loyal voices in and out of the East German Communist party saw the nation 's unrest coming .
The first signs were economic .
Despite heavily subsidized consumer industries East Germans have for years watched the West pull farther out ahead .
In 1988 for the first time economic growth came to a dead stop .
Gingerly some economists began to blame central planning .
Some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy at least in the workplace .
By summer an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before .
But they are stalwart socialists .
Their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse East Germany of its Stalinist muck not to merge with the West .
One of their pastors has envisioned a new utopia of creative socialism .
Meanwhile the man Mr. Krenz replaces has left an indelible mark on East German society .
Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs Mr. Honecker typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in Eastern Europe who took their cues from Moscow .
He was a socialist warrior who felt rankled by West Germany 's enormous postwar prosperity and the Bonn government 's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state .
Finally during his first and only state visit to Bonn two years ago he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought .
But ultimately he was undone by forces unleashed by his own comrade Mr. Gorbachev .
Mr. Honecker 's removal was bound to happen says one aide to Chancellor Kohl .
It was only a matter of time .
The European Community Commission increased its forecast for economic growth in the EC in 1989 to 3.5 % slightly higher than its June projection of 3.25 % .
In its annual economic report for 1989-1990 the commission also projected 1990 gross domestic product growth for the 12 EC members at 3 % .
EC inflation was seen at 4.8 % in 1989 higher than 1988 's 3.6 % price rise .
However inflation for 1990 was seen slowing to 4.5 % .
Leading EC growth forecasts in 1989 was Ireland seen growing 5 % at constant prices .
Slower growth countries included Greece at 2.5 % the U.K. at 2.25 % and Denmark at 1.75 % .
Inflation is expected to be highest in Greece where it is projected at 14.25 % and Portugal at 13 % .
At the other end of the spectrum West German inflation was forecast at 3 % in 1989 and 2.75 % in 1990 .
Nestle Korea Ltd. opened a coffee and non-dairy-creamer plant in Chongju South Korea .
An official at Nestle Korea a 50-50 joint venture between Nestle S.A. and the Doosan Group said the new facility will manufacture all types of soluble roasted and ground coffee coffee mix and nondairy coffee creamer .
The South Korean coffee market consisting mostly of instant coffee was estimated at about 100 billion won 150.7 million last year .
Brands made by the Kraft General Foods unit of Philip Morris Cos. had about 95 % of the market share .
Nestle currently has only about a 2 % share with its Taster 's Choice coffee .
Poland plans to start negotiations soon on purchasing natural gas from Iran the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported .
The agency said Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki told Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi of Poland 's willingess to purchase the gas during Mr. Vaezi 's current visit to Warsaw .
The agency did n't mention possible quantities and did n't say how the gas would be delivered .
A Chinese official harshly criticized plans to close a British naval base in downtown Hong Kong .
Hong Kong officials announced last week that the base will be relocated to a small island to allow downtown redevelopment .
But Beijing wants to use the base for the People 's Liberation Army after 1997 when the territory returns to Chinese sovereignty .
Ke Zaishuo head of China 's delegation to a Chinese-British Liaison Committee on Hong Kong accused Britain of trying to impose a fait accompli and said This is something we can not accept .
The Israeli and Soviet national airlines have reached preliminary agreement for launching the first direct flights between Tel Aviv and Moscow a spokesman for the Israeli airline El Al said .

He added that concluding the deal requires approval by the governments of both countries which have never had direct air links .
The chairman and a director of one of the Republic of Singapore 's leading property companies City Development Ltd. or CDL were charged yesterday with criminal breach of trust of some 800,000 Singapore dollars about 409,000 .
Kwek Hong Png chairman of CDL and director Quek Leng Chye were arrested by the republic 's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau Tuesday night .
In addition to abetting in the alleged criminal breach of trust Kwek Hong Png was also charged with dishonestly receiving 500,000 that had been stolen .
Both men were charged in a subordinate court and released on bail of 1 million .
The charges are the culmination of weeks of rumors concerning CDL that have depressed the company 's share price and to a lesser extent the shares of all companies owned by CDL 's controlling Quek family brokers in Singapore say .
The Queks control the Hong Leong Group which has widespread interests in manufacturing property and finance in both Malaysia and Singapore .
News of the arrest and charging of the two men helped to push prices on the Singapore Stock market sharply lower in early trading yesterday but brokers said that the market and CDL shares recovered once it became apparent the charges were limited to the two men personally .

As the citizens of San Francisco and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from Tuesday 's devastating earthquake NBC News began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake 's initial moments .
In terms of coverage it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes said Eric Premner president for broadcasting of King Broadcasting Co. which owns the NBC affiliate in Seattle Wash .
While rival ABC News outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck the network was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park when the quake struck NBC News was unable to get its signal out of San Francisco for the first hour after the quake .
I have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster said Mr. Premner .
So before I start to be really critical of NBC I would like to know more about what happened .
There were no complaints from affiliates of CBS Inc. and Cable News Network a unit of Turner Broadcasting System Inc .
But that was not the case at NBC News which has been dogged with the image of not being aggressive on major breaking stories .
Last summer the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student uprising in China .
I was not pleased with the slow start and neither was NBC News said Guy Hempel general manager of NBC affiliate WAVE in Louisville Ky .
A spokesman for National Broadcasting Co. a unit of General Electric Co. said the network was looking into what happened .
The stations said they were pleased with the extended coverage yesterday including a special five-hour edition of Today .
Don Browne director of news at NBC News said in an interview that we could n't get a signal out of San Francisco .
We were out of the box .
It was horrible .
The comment we 're hearing is that we were slow out of the box but beat everyone else in the stretch .
NBC broadcast throughout the entire night and did not go off the air until noon yesterday .
The quake postponed the third and fourth games of the World Series .
In place of the games ABC said it planned to broadcast next week 's episodes of its prime-time Wednesday and Thursday lineups except for a one-hour special on the earthquake at 10 p.m. last night .
The series is scheduled to resume Tuesday evening in San Francisco .
There are no commercials to make up for since we 're going to eventually broadcast the World Series said a network spokesman .
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. said it suspended indefinitely its common stock dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter net income .
The announcement made after the close of trading caught analysts by surprise .
The company closed at 12 a share down 62.5 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Pinnacle West slashed its quarterly dividend to 40 cents per share from 70 cents in December saying at the time that it believed the new lower dividend was sustainable .
A company spokesman said the decision to eliminate the dividend resulted from a quarterly appraisal and that circumstances had changed since the December announcement .
He declined to elaborate .
Edward J. Tirello Jr. an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. speculated that the sudden dividend elimination presages an expensive agreement with thrift regulators over the company 's insolvent MeraBank savings and loan unit .
Analysts have estimated that Pinnacle West may have to inject between 300 million and 400 million into the MeraBank unit before turning the thrift over to federal regulators .
The latest financial results at the troubled utility and thrift holding company based in Phoenix Ariz. reflect continuing problems at MeraBank and losses in real-estate venture-capital and uranium-mining operations .
Third-quarter net income slid to 5.1 million or six cents a share from 56 million or 65 cents a year earlier .
Utility operations the only company unit operating in the black in the latest period had a 26 % drop in profit to 86.3 million largely as a result of outages at the company 's huge Palo Verde nuclear facility and the cost of purchased replacement power .
In other operations losses at MeraBank totaled 85.7 million in the latest quarter compared with a 2.5 million profit a year earlier .
The latest quarter includes a 42.7 million addition to loan-loss reserves .
As recently as August the company said it did n't foresee a need for substantial additions to reserves .
Pinnacle 's SunCor Development Co .
real-estate unit 's loss narrowed to 13.8 million from 78.4 million .
The latest period included a 9 million write-down on undeveloped land while the year-earlier period included a 46 million reserve for real-estate losses .
Losses at its Malapai Resources Co .
uranium-mining unit narrowed to 3.4 million from 18 million a year ago which included a 9 million write-down of utility inventories .
Losses at El Dorado Investment Co. the venture-capital operation widened to 6.8 million from 425,000 a year earlier .
The latest quarter included a 6.6 million write-down of investments .
Equitec Financial Group said it will ask as many as 100,000 investors in 12 of its public real-estate limited partnerships to give approval to rolling them up into a new master limited partnership .
Under the proposal by Equitec a financially troubled real-estate syndicator New York-based Hallwood Group Inc. would replace Equitec as the newly formed master limited partnership 's general partner and manager .
Shares of the new partnership would trade on an exchange like a stock .
Hallwood is a merchant bank whose activities include the ownership management and financial restructuring of shopping centers office buildings apartments and other real estate .
In a statement Equitec Chairman Richard L. Saalfeld said the transfer will benefit both the company and investors in the 12 limited partnerships included in the proposed rollup .
While he did n't describe the partnerships ' financial condition he said their operations continue to drain the resources of Equitec .
Equitec posted a 3.3 million net loss in the second quarter on 11.8 million of revenue compared with a net loss of 12.9 million in the year-earlier period on revenue of 9.1 million .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Equitec closed at 2.625 a share unchanged .
Because of Tuesday 's earthquake in Northern California company officials could n't immediately be reached for additional comment .
A spokesman for Hallwood said the 12 limited partnerships which were marketed by brokerage firms and financial planners between 1979 and 1984 raised several hundred million dollars from investors .
With airline deals in a tailspin legendary Wall Street trader Michael Steinhardt could have trouble parachuting out of USAir Group traders say .
Only a week ago when airline buy-out fever was already winding down Mr. Steinhardt was engaged in a duel with USAir .
He was threatening to take over the carrier after spending an estimated 167 million to build an 8.4 % USAir stake for his investment clients .
The would-be raider even hired an investment banker to give teeth to his takeover threat which was widely interpreted as an effort to flush out an acquirer for USAir or for his own stake .
In fighting USAir Mr. Steinhardt was pitted against another investor billionnaire Warren Buffett who bought into USAir to help fend off Mr. Steinhardt .
Mr. Buffett 's firm Berkshire Hathaway holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than Mr. Steinhardt 's firm Steinhardt Partners .
Now in the wake of UAL 's troubles in financing its buy-out the airline raiding game has been grounded .
Instead of hoping to sell his USAir stake at analysts ' estimated buy-out price of 80 a share Mr. Steinhardt is stuck with roughly 3.7 million USAir shares that cost him 45 on average but yesterday closed at 40 1\/2 up 1\/4 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
It does n't make sense to parachute out at this price Mr. Steinhardt says though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends USAir managers ' operating skills .
At the current price the USAir holding represents 9 % of all the assets that Mr. Steinhardt manages .
A week ago USAir stock briefly soared above 52 after a report in USA Today that Mr. Steinhardt might launch a hostile bid for the carrier though takeover speculators say they were skeptical .
If USAir is worth 80 as a takeover and the stock went to 52 the market was saying Steinhardt 's presence was n't worth anything in terms of getting a deal done says a veteran takeover speculator .
Traders say this all goes to show that even the smartest money manager can get infected with crowd passions .
In trying to raid USAir Mr. Steinhardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor and ran into snags .
Moreover unlike Mr. Buffett who often holds big stakes in companies for years Mr. Steinhardt has n't in the past done much long-term investing .
Mr. Steinhardt who runs about 1.7 billion for Steinhardt Partners made his name as a gunslinging trader moving in and out of stocks with agility enriching himself and his investment clients .
Meanwhile his big losses for instance in 1987 's crash generally have been trading losses .
So some see a special irony in the fact that Mr. Steinhardt the trader now is encumbered with a massive illiquid airline holding .
Analysts say USAir stock might lose four or five points if the Steinhardt stake was dumped all at once .
As a result Mr. Steinhardt must reconcile himself to selling USAir at a loss or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment .
Long-term investing that 's not Steinhardt 's style chuckles an investor who once worked at Steinhardt Partners .
He does n't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an ace in the hole adds another Steinhardt Partners alumnus .
In recent days traders say USAir has been buying its own shares as part of a program to retire about eight million USAir shares though the carrier wo n't discuss its buy-back program .
If USAir stepped up its share purchases that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out says Timothy Pettee a Merrill Lynch analyst .
But USAir might not want to help Mr. Steinhardt he adds .
In 1987 USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny stonewalled when Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn threatened to take over the carrier .
Mr. Icahn a much more practiced raider than Mr. Steinhardt eventually sold a big USAir stake at a tiny profit through Bear Stearns .
Mr. Steinhardt also could take that route .
He confers big trading commissions on Wall Street firms .
However with airline stocks cratering he might not get a very good price for his shares traders say .
Especially galling for Mr. Steinhardt say people close to him is that USAir 's Mr. Colodny wo n't even take his telephone calls .
While USAir is n't considered absolutely takeover-proof its defenses including the sale in August of a 12 % stake in the company to Mr. Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway are pretty strong .
USAir 's deal with Mr. Buffett was n't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy Mr. Steinhardt says .
Since last April the investor has made seven so-called 13D filings in USAir as he bought and sold the company 's stock .
Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company 's managers and to stir interest in the stock .
But of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as Steinhardt Partners to take over a company .
USAir and Mr. Buffett wo n't talk about Mr. Steinhardt at all .
Analysts say USAir has great promise .
By the second half of 1990 USAir stock could hit 60 says Helane Becker of Shearson Lehman Hutton .
She thinks traders should buy the stock if it tumbles to 35 .
But meanwhile USAir is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest Piedmont Airlines which it acquired .
Moreover some investors think a recession or renewed airfare wars will pummel airline stocks in coming months .
However Mr. Steinhardt says he 's comfortable holding USAir as an investment .
While he has bought and sold some USAir shares in recent days he says that contrary to rumors he has n't tried to unload his holding .
Mr. Steinhardt adds that he bought USAir stock earlier this year as part of a fundamental investment in the airline group .
In 1989 Mr. Steinhardt says he made money trading in Texas Air AMR and UAL .
Overall his investments so far this year are showing gains of about 20 % he adds .
Does Mr. Steinhardt regret his incursion into the takeover-threat game .
People close to the investor say that was an experiment he is unlikely to repeat .
I do n't think you 'll find I 'm making a radical change in my traditional investment style Mr. Steinhardt says .
Addington Resources Inc. said it called for redemption on Nov. 21 its 25.8 million outstanding of 8 % convertible subordinated debentures due 2013 .
The debentures were issued in the face amount of 46 million on July 11 1988 the Ashland Ky. coal mining water transportation and construction company said .
The company said the redemption is permitted because the price of Addington 's stock has equaled or exceeded 19.60 for 20 consecutive trading days a condition set in the terms of the debentures .
Debenture holders are expected to convert most of the debentures into common because the value of the stock received in a conversion would exceed the 1,103.11 redemption price .
Commodore International Ltd. said it will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 because sales of personal computers for the home market remained weak in some major countries .
That will mark the second consecutive quarterly loss for Commodore and will raise additional questions about whether it can sustain the turnaround it had seemed to be engineering .
Commodore West Chester Pa. had said in August that it was consolidating manufacturing to cut costs and expected to be profitable in the fiscal first quarter .
Commodore said that its announcement is based on preliminary information and that the situation could look different by the time final results are announced early next month .
In fact Commodore 's fiscal fourth-quarter loss was 2 million narrower than Commodore had expected a few weeks after the quarter closed .
Still even results approaching break-even would mark a sharp weakening compared with fiscal 1989 first-quarter earnings of 9.6 million or 30 cents a share on sales of 200.2 million .
Reflecting concerns about Commodore 's outlook its stock has plunged more than 50 % since May closing yesterday unchanged at 8.875 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
The price can be expected to erode further because the loss estimate came after the market closed .
Commodore has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the U.S. where its personal-computer sales have been so dismal for years that Commodore is close to dropping off research firms ' market-share charts .
Commodore has assembled an experienced management team it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign .
But those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly even if they turn out to be the right ones .
In the meantime the strategies will increase expenses .
Commodore had been counting on its consumer business to stay sufficiently healthy to support its efforts in other areas mainly in getting schools and businesses to use its Amiga which has slick graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it is n't compatible with Apple Computer Inc. or International Business Machines Corp. hardware .
But sales to consumers have become difficult during the past several months even in West Germany which has been by far Commodore 's strongest market .
The Commodore 64 and 128 mainly used for children 's educational software and games had surprised market researchers by continuing to produce strong sales even though other low-profit personal computers now operate several times as fast and have much more memory .
Commodore has said it expects sales to rebound but market researchers have said that sales of the low-end products may finally be trailing off .
Stock prices closed slightly higher in the first routine trading day since Friday 's big plunge .
Some issues were affected by Tuesday 's devastating earthquake in the San Francisco area .
Activity continued to slow from the hectic pace set during the market 's plunge late Friday and its rebound Monday as players began to set their sights on events coming later this week .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted through the session within a trading range of about 30 points before closing with a gain of 4.92 at 2643.65 .
Broader averages also posted modest gains .
Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index rose 0.60 to 341.76 the Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 0.71 to 320.54 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.43 to 189.32 .
Some 822 New York Stock Exchange issues advanced in price while 668 declined .
But the Dow Jones Transportation Average went down for the seventh consecutive session due largely to further selling in UAL .
The average dropped 6.40 to 1247.87 and has now lost 21.7 % of its value since the losing streak began Oct. 10 .
Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks from 224.1 million Tuesday .
Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September due today and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown .
In addition activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area .
Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying .
The early move essentially established the day 's trading range and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently .
I did n't expect it to be this quiet .
I expected to see more volatility as some of the institutions who were spooked last Friday did some selling said Raymond F. DeVoe a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Baltimore .
Mr. DeVoe said he expects prices to show some renewed instability over the next few sessions as institutions re-evaluate their stance toward the market in light of its decline .
I would suspect that a lot of investment committees are looking into whether they want to be in stocks at all he said .
Insurance stocks were sold at the opening amid concerns about the level of damage claims the companies would receive as a result of the earthquake .
But those issues recovered quickly and turned higher because of expectations that the quake and the recent Hurricane Hugo would set the stage for an increase in premium rates .
Issues of insurance brokers were especially strong .
