 about having root-canal work .
And my time has come .
I 'm 33 married no children and employed in writing stories like this one .
In times past life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household meaning men but ours is a two-income family and accustomed to it .
So if anything happened to me I 'd want to leave behind enough so that my 33-year-old husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts though not I admit enough to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury .
Figuring that maybe 100,000 to 150,000 would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted I looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies and plunged into a jungle of gibberish .
Over the past decade or two while I was thinking about fox hunting the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products variations on products and variations on the variations .
Besides term life and whole life the old standbys we now have universal life universal variable life flexible adjustable universal life policies with persistency bonuses policies festooned with exotic riders living benefit policies and on and on .
What to do .
First generalize .
Shorn of all their riders special provisions and other bells and whistles insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories so-called pure insurance which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death and permanent insurance which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive .
If all you want is death-benefit coverage pure insurance a term policy gives you maximum bang for your buck within limits .
It 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age .
But term means just that the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires .
It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal if you flunk which means you need insurance more than ever you may not be able to buy it .
Even if you 're healthy and can renew your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older .
So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks .
There are all sorts of variations on term insurance policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt term riders tacked on to permanent insurance and many others .
One variation that appealed to me at first was the Money Smart Term Life policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. the American Express unit to the parent company 's credit-card holders .
Upon examination however I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense .
Amex said it would charge me 576 a year for 100,000 of coverage and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years .
Sounds great or does it .
First if I canceled I 'd have no more insurance a not insignificant consideration .
Second the 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation Amex not I would get the benefit of the investment income on my money income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit .
Third and most important Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile .
That would be all right with Amex which could then lock in its investment profit but it does n't add up to a smart money move for me .
Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else There is no free lunch there is only marketing .
And the Second Law unique to insurance .
If I die early I win a hollow victory since I ca n't enjoy it and if I live long the insurer wins .
Always .
This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance the kind that amasses cash value .
The word death can not be escaped entirely by the industry but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms preferring to talk about savings and investment instead .
The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature .
That is gilding the lily .
The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into .
That 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package .
Again no free lunch .
This is reflected in a built-in mortality cost in effect your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection .
And in most cases a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is in effect paying the salesman 's commission as well investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years largely because of this .
So view permanent insurance for what it is a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment .
The simplest most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy .
You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing and your cash value and dividends grow over the years .
One newer wrinkle so called single-premium life you pay for the whole policy at once has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy loans and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment .
Congress closed this loophole last year or thought it did .
However Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield Mass. has developed a combination plan of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences .
But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small .
I 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately so I look into the broad category called universal life .
Hugely popular it is far more flexible than straight whole life .
I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy .
In looking at these and other policies I learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into policy illustrations the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years .
They commonly give two scenarios One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees usually 4 % to 4.5 % and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment often 8.5 % or more .
Projecting the latter over several decades I find my cash buildup is impressive but can any high interest rate prevail for that long .
Not likely I think .
Also some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year .
These are not certain either .
Companies are n't comfortable playing these games but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good says Timothy Pfiefer an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast a unit of Towers Perrin Co. the big New York consulting firm .
Another factor to consider Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately .
There are seemingly endless twists to universal life and it pays to ask questions about all of them .
At a back-yard barbecue for example a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be guaranteed .
I call her agent David Dominici .
Yes he says premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to vanish after a certain period but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection .
If interest rates plunge the insurer may be knocking on my door asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection .
I do n't like the sound of that .
Some insurers have also started offering persistency bonuses such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield if the policy is maintained for 10 years .
But Glenn Daily a New York-based financial consultant warns that many of these bonuses are just fantasies because most are n't guaranteed by the companies .
And the feature is so new he adds that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments .
So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection .
Offered by insurers that include Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. Jackson National Life Insurance Co. and National Travelers Life Insurance Co. these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive .
Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer heart attarcks renal failure and kidney transplants .
But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined vary from policy to policy and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance .
Also financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes .
And considering the extra cost of such provisions some figure that people interested in say paying for extended nursing-home care would be better off just buying a separate policy that provides it .
I 'm more favorably impressed by no-load life even though it turns out to be low-load life .
Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen there is still a load annual administrative fees and initial setup charges but I figure that the lack of commission and of surrender fees for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot .
I compared one universal policy for 130,000 face amount from such an insurer American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln Neb. with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen .
After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with 792 but get only 14 from the Equitable .
The difference is magnified by time too .
At age 65 when I 'd stop paying premiums the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value 14,000 higher than the other even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate .
Did I buy it .
Well not yet .
I 'm thinking about using the 871 annual premium to finance a trip to Paris first .
A person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it .
Rorer Group Inc. will report that third-quarter profit rose more than 15 % from a year earlier though the gain is wholly due to asset sales Robert Cawthorn chairman president and chief executive officer said .
His projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than 17.4 million or 55 cents a share compared with 15.2 million or 48 cents a share a year ago .
Mr. Cawthorn said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of somewhat less than 10 % .
Through the first six months of 1989 sales had grown about 12 % from the year-earlier period .
Growth of 10 % would make sales for the latest quarter 269 million compared with 244.6 million a year ago .
Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs .
Asilone an antacid was sold to Boots PLC London .
Thrombinar a drug used to stanch bleeding was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. St. Louis .
He said Rorer sold the drugs for nice prices and will record a combined pretax gain on the sales of 20 million .
As the gain from the sales indicates operating profit was significantly below the year-earlier level Mr. Cawthorn said .
Rorer in July had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989 .
He said the company is still looking for a strong fourth quarter in all areas sales operating income and net income .
Mr. Cawthorn attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars to accelerated buying of Rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending July 1 price increase and to higher marketing expenses for Rorer 's Maalox antacid whose sales and market share in the U.S. had slipped in the first half of 1989 .
He said Rorer opted to sell Asilone and Thrombinar to raise revenue that would kick start its increased marketing efforts behind Maalox still its top-selling product with about 215 million in world-wide sales in 1988 .
We had underfunded Maalox for a year he said because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs .
He said Rorer will spend 15 million to 20 million more on Maalox advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period .
A big chunk of that additional spending came in the third quarter he said .
Hoechst AG said it will stop producing fertilizer in 1990 because of continued losses and a bleak outlook .
The West German chemical concern said it will close the last remaining fertilizer plant in Oberhausen in the fall of next year .
Hoechst said the fertilizer market faces overcapacity in Western Europe rising imports from East bloc countries and overseas and declining demand .
HomeFed Corp. said its main subsidiary Home Federal Savings & Loan converted from a federal savings and loan to a federal savings bank and changed its name to HomeFed Bank .
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision approved the conversion last Friday HomeFed said .
The change in charter does n't alter the federal insurance of deposits federal regulatory powers or company operations a spokesman said .

The industrials were up about 60 points in the afternoon but cautious investors took profits before the close .
Traders said a variety of factors triggered the rally .
The consumer price index rose 0.2 % in September while many economists were looking for a 0.4 % increase .
Stock-index arbitrage buy programs in which traders buy stock against offsetting positions in futures to lock in price differences helped the rally 's momentum .
The euphoria was such that investors responded to good earnings reports of companies such as American Express while ignoring the disappointing profits of companies such as Caterpillar analysts said .
Stock-index arbitrage trading was a minor influence in yesterday 's rally traders said .
Institutional buyers were the main force pushing blue chips higher .
To the amazement of some traders takeover stocks were climbing again .

Takeover enthusiasm may have been renewed when an investor group disclosed yesterday that it had obtained all the financing required to complete its 1.6 billion leveraged buy-out of American Medical International .
That 's put some oomph back into this market said Peter VandenBerg a vice president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton .
But some traders thought there was less to the rally than met the eye .
There is no strength behind this rally asserted Chung Lew head trader at Kleinwort Benson North America .
It 's traders squaring positions .
It 's not good the market is setting up for another fall .
Indeed many traders said that uncertainty about today 's monthly expiration of stocks-index futures and options and options on individual stocks prompted a lot of buying by speculative traders who were unwinding positions that were bets on declining stock prices .

The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment that President Bush sought to protect the U.S. flag from desecration .
The 51-48 roll call fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve changes to the Constitution .
The vote in which 11 GOP lawmakers voted against Mr. Bush 's position was a victory for Democratic leaders who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights .

In order to defuse pressure for an amendment Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley D. Wash .
had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change .
Mr. Bush said he would allow the bill to become law without his signature because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately .
In June the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration saying he was engaging in political expression that is protected by the First Amendment .
