a portfolio .
In a nutshell pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in defensive industries .
A heavy dose of cash is prescribed along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds preferably government bonds .
It 's tempting to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand .
But that may not be possible because recessions often take investors by surprise .
They always seem to come a bit later than you expect .
When they do hit they hit fast says David A. Wyss chief financial economist at the Data Resources division of McGraw-Hill Inc .
Though he himself does n't expect a recession soon Mr. Wyss advises people who do that the best thing to be in is long that is 20-year to 30-year Treasury bonds .
The reason is simple Mr. Wyss says Interest rates almost always decline during recession .
As surely as a seesaw tilts falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds .
They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do .
That effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds .
But short-term bonds ca n't rise too much because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon .
Long-term bonds with many years left before maturity swing more widely in price .
But not just any bonds will do .
Corporate bonds are usually not a good bet in a recession Mr. Wyss says .
As times get tougher investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts .
This hurts the price of corporate bonds .
Also he notes most corporate bonds are callable .
That means that a corporation after a specified amount of time has passed can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value plus in some cases a sweetener .
When interest rates have dropped it makes sense for corporations to do just that they then save on interest costs .
But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny .
If corporate bonds are bad in recessions junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all .
It 's an absolute necessity to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing says Avner Arbel professor of finance at Cornell University .
Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside and this could be a disaster .
Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government .
During an economic slump local tax revenues often go down raising the risks associated with at least some municipals .
And like corporates many municipal bonds are callable .
But a few experts going against the consensus do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing .
One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co. a brokerage house in Houston who thinks that we 're either in a recession or about to go into one .
What 's more he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual Once the downturn comes it 's going to be very hard to reverse .
Investors he advises should be cautious holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds .
Because he sees a 5 % to 6 % base rate of inflation in the economy he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon .
Instead Mr. Beach says investors probably should be carrying a very high level of cash by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills .
Greg Confair president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown Pa. also recommends that investors go heavily for cash .
He is n't sure a recession is coming but says the other likely alternative reignited inflation is just as bad .
This late in an expansion the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession Mr. Confair says .
The Federal Reserve Board 's plan for a soft landing he says requires the Fed to navigate an ever-narrowing corridor .
A soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all Mr. Confair adds .
It has to be engineered over and over again month after month .
He believes that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw .
And in a sense that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios .
It comes down to a question of whether to try to time the market .
For people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad stocks have been rewarding long-term investments .
Most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9 % to 10 % including both dividends and price appreciation .
That 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid .
Moreover because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing .
Trying to time the economy is a mistake says David Katz chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York .
Mr. Katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years .
Investors who listened and lightened up on stocks have just hurt themselves he says .
Mr. Katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70 % of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy .
Frequent trading runs up high commission costs .
And the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time .
Still few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming .
After all in all five recessions since 1960 stocks declined .
According to Ned Davis president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis Fla. the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21 % and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started .
By the time a recession is official two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product much of the damage to stocks has already been done and in the typical case the recession is already half over .
About six months before a recession ends stocks typically begin to rise again as investors anticipate a recovery .
The average recession lasts about a year .
Unfortunately though recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't reliably be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases .
But whatever their advice about timing none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession .
For the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks professionals have a number of suggestions .
Mr. Katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios that is low prices in relation to the company 's earnings per share .
Low P-E stocks he says vastly outperform others during a recession or bear market .
In good times he says they lag a bit but overall they provide superior performance .
Prof. Arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small companies .
Small-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession he says .
And in any case he argues stocks of small companies are almost as overpriced as they were Sept. 30 1987 just before the crash .
For example Mr. Arbel says stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow .
Cash flow basically earnings plus depreciation is one common gauge of a company 's financial health .
That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash Mr. Arbel says .
And it 's way above the ratio 7.5 times cash flow that bigger companies are selling for .
Another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in defensive industries .
Food tobacco drugs and utilities are the classic examples .
Recession or not people still eat smoke and take medicine when they 're sick .
George Putnam III editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston offers one final tip for recession-wary investors .
Keep some money available for opportunities he says .
If the recession does hit there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest .
Mr. Dorfman covers investing issues from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau .
Some industry groups consistently weather the storm better than others .
The following shows the number of times these industries outperformed the Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index during the first six months of the past seven recessions .
Bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt .
But while the overall market improved the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count casualties even as junk-bond prices rose .
Yesterday Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it postponed a 220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by York International Corp .
And Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a 475 million debenture offering by Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. that was still being negotiated late last night .
The issue by Chicago & North Western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar .
Some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk .
Since last week 's junk-bond market debacle many new issues of high-yield high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back delayed or dropped .
On Wednesday Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines ' junk-bond offering to 71 million from 150 million .
Salomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co. 's 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction .
Last week the Grand Union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock .
Prudential-Bache said the York issue was delayed because of market conditions .
Everything is going through firehoops right now and Chicago & North Western is no exception said Mariel Clemensen vice president high-yield research at Citicorp .
Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals .
Dan Baldwin managing director of high-yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management said the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured in part because several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package .
If you 're going to take the risk in this market you want something extra .
Mr. Baldwin likes the offering .
But several mutual-fund managers nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class .
While they consider the Chicago & North Western issue to be good they do n't view it as the best .
To lure buyers to the Chicago & North Western bonds portfolio managers said Donaldson Lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10 % equity kicker .
The bonds are expected to have a 14 1\/2 % coupon rate .
The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10 % of the stock of CNW Corp. Chicago & North Western 's parent company .
Donaldson Lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring .
According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations the 10 % of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank Blackstone Group which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5 % each .
That would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60 % stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15 % .
Despite the problems with new issues high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary or resell market .
Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership rising one point .
In the Treasury market the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point or 8.75 for each 1,000 face amount .
The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows .
That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower .
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2 % last month slightly lower than some economists had expected .
But there were also rumors yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term Treasurys .
Short-term Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher .
Yesterday the Fed executed four-day matched sales a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system .
The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the Fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 3\/4 % at which it has been hovering around during the past week .
The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans .
It is considered an early signal of Fed credit policy changes .
The fact that they did four-day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively .
They are telling us that 8 3\/4 % is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate said Robert Chandross at Lloyds Bank PLC .
Treasury Securities The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 25\/32 to yield 7.955 % compared with 100 29\/32 to yield 8.032 % Wednesday .
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 9\/32 to yield 7.937 % compared with 99 26\/32 to yield 8.007 % .
Short-term rates rose yesterday .
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % .
Meanwhile the Treasury sold 9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday .
The average yield on the bills was 7.35 % down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21 .
Yesterday 's yield was the lowest since 7.22 % on July 27 .
Here are details of the auction Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it .
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year .
Corporate Issues Junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities .
Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1\/4 to 1\/2 point with so-called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one-point gains .
Petrolane Gas Service 's 13 1\/4 % debentures traded at 102 after trading around par earlier this week and RJR 's 13 1\/2 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5\/8 after trading at below par earlier this week .
Investment-grade bonds were unchanged .
Municipals Activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector .
Traders estimated that more than 140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers .
There was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios .
According to market participants the bonds were met with decent bids but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield .
Away from the general obligation sector activity was modest .
Long dollar bonds were flat to up 3\/8 point .
New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was up 3\/8 at 98 3\/8 bid to yield about 7.32 % down 0.03 percentage point .
The debt of some California issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday 's massive earthquake although traders said market participants remained cautious .
California expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its 1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated 500 million to 1 billion in damages resulting from the quake according to a state official .
It 's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve said Cindy Katz assistant director of California 's department of finance although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated .
Meanwhile new issuance was slow .
The largest sale in the competitive arena was a 55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority .
A balance of 25.8 million remained in late order-taking according to the lead manager .
Mortgage-Backed Securities Mortgage securities generally ended 6\/32 to 9\/32 point higher but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts .
Premium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon rates of 13 % and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by Congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages .
Ginnie Mae 13 % securities were down about 1\/4 at 109 30\/32 .
If the refinancing plan clears Congress there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities hurting any investor paying much above par for them .
In the current-coupon sector a shift in the Treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings .
Ginnie Mae 9 % securities ended at 98 6\/32 up 9\/32 and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 % securities were at 97 10\/32 up 6\/32 .
The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 9.42 % to a 12-year average life assumption as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48 .
While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the Treasury yield curve underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable .
Two new Remics totaling 900 million were announced by Freddie Mac yesterday .
Foreign Bonds British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson .
The Treasury 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 was down 2\/32 at 111 29\/32 to yield 10.09 % while the 11 3\/4 % notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 19\/32 to yield 12.94 % .
In Japan the bellwether No. 111 4.6 % bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72 to yield 5.32 % and in West Germany the 7 % benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02 % .
THE PANHANDLER approaches makes his pitch .
It may be straightforward he wants money for food or incredibly convoluted his sister is at this very moment near death in Hoboken he has lost his wallet and has only 1.22 in change to put toward a bus ticket costing 3.83 and wo n't you give him the difference .
No .
Well how about a loan he 'll take your name and address Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this .
But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer famine child abuse or what have you .
Most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals .
But will it .
In a distressing number of cases no .
In fact the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler at least he has no overhead and he might even be telling the truth .
Last year more than 100 billion was donated to the nation 's 400,000 charities .
While the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for it 's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in expenses claimed by other operators including fraudulent expenses .
In many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries .
It 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs high-living operators and downright fraud .
But the problem clearly is widespread and persistent .
State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging .
The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year measuring them against minimum standards for accountability for accuracy and honesty in solicitation and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established .
The Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program .
Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test .
Which it should be added does n't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway .
Without a microscope and a subpoena it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself .
On this basis there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one says David Ormstedt an assistant attorney general in Connecticut .
A lot of donors just get taken .
Including those he contends who put about 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center .
The state has sued these charities in state court complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent 82 % says Mr. Ormstedt went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives for fur coats trips to Florida Lucullan restaurant tabs .
The telephone number for the charity in Shelton Conn. has been disconnected and the former officials could n't be located .
Running a charity does cost money but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed .
The Arthritis Foundation the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90 % of their income on programs not overhead .
With some other charities however it s the other way around .
The fledgling National Children 's Cancer Society for example took in 2.5 million last year to finance bone-marrow transplants for children .
By the time it paid its expenses it only had 120,000 left not enough to treat even one child .
The state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago along with Telesystems Marketing Inc. its Houston-based fund raiser .
Both deny wrongdoing .
The charity admits spending a lot on fund raising but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come .
Michael Burns president of Telesystems says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children 's .
Meanwhile a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds .
Enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising .
State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income usually half that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court .
It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression .
This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently .
The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere .
In making cases the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers .
Illinois for instance currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there .
Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give .
Attorneys general in several states including Illinois are already suing Watson & Hughey Co. an Alexandria Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America .
According to the Illinois attorney general 's suit Watson & Hughey sent mailings i
