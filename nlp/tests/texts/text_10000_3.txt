MUTUAL FUNDS ARRIVED IN THE U.S. during the Roaring Twenties they had been in Britain for a century but they did n't boom until the money market fund was created in the 1970s .
By 1980 there were more than 100 such funds .
Besides creating a vehicle for investors money market funds also helped rewrite banking regulations .
The idea was to let small investors the backbone of the fund business deal in the money market 's high short-term interest rates .
This had been the exclusive province of those rich enough to use six-figure sums to get income that was figured beyond the third or fourth decimal place .
The now-standard price of 1 a share came about by accident .
An early fund had filed a registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included a fixed 1 price .
It arrived just as the regulator handling such operations was retiring .
His successor approved the 1 price in the process of clearing the backed-up papers on his desk .
When Dreyfus started the first advertising-backed retail fund in February 1974 it was priced at 10 a share and reached 1 billion in assets in one year .
Dreyfus moved to the 1 price after the SEC set standards an average 120-day maturity of high-grade paper that are still the rule .
Keeping the listed price at a dollar is primarily a convenience .
Actually the funds do fluctuate but beyond the third decimal place .
Rounding-off keeps them at 1 .
Eventually the money funds ' success forced relaxation of curbs on bank interest rates to allow banks to offer competing yields .
The new instrument also introduced many to the industry 30 % of fund owners there are more than 54 million accounts started with a money fund .
Today more than 470 money market funds have total assets exceeding 350 billion .
The companion tax-exempt funds add 71 billion .
Dreyfus alone has seen its money market funds grow from 1 billion in 1975 to closes to 15 billion today .

H. postponed their formal endorsement of a merger with Daimler-Benz AG until another meeting on Nov. 17 .
The owners of the defense and aerospace concern which include three regional states several industrial companies and banks met Friday to discuss the final terms of the transaction in which Daimler-Benz will acquire 50.01 % of But agreement aparently could n't be reached because of opposition from the states of Hamburg and Bremen which are demanding more influence over the German Airbus operations and a better guarantee against job losses in the troubled Northern German region .

The government issues its first reading on third-quarter real gross national product this week in a report that is expected to disclose much tamer inflation .
The consensus view on real GNP the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services adjusted for inflation calls for a 2.3 % gain down from the second quarter 's 2.5 % according to MMS International a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. New York .
But inflation as measured by the GNP deflator in Thursday 's report is expected to rise only 3.5 % down from 4.6 % in the second quarter .
Inflation could be a real surprise said Samuel D. Kahan chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago .
If that gets people excited it could serve as an impetus to the fixed-income markets to lower their rates he added .
The week 's other notable indicators include mid-October auto sales September durable goods orders as well as September personal income personal consumption and the saving rate .
Most are expected to fall below previous-month levels .
Many economists see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of the year with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession .
In addition to softer production data weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence some analysts believe the two recent natural disasters Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter .
The recent one-day 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems to be significant to economists mainly for its tacit comment on the poor quality of third-quarter profits now being reported .
The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling says Michael K. Evans president of Evans Economics Inc. Washington .
The economy he noted moves the market not vice versa .
On the other hand Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP .
His estimate of 3.3 % for third-quarter GNP is higher than the consensus largely because he believes current inventories are n't as low as official figures indicate .
Demand he believes is being met from overhang rather than new production .
By and large economists believe the two natural catastrophes will limit economic damage to their regions .
Edward J. Campbell economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. New York noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas .
Gary Ciminero economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group Providence R.I. expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % partly because of what he believes will be temporarily better price behavior .
He expects real GNP growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter noting a wider trade deficit slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures .
Sung Won Sohn chief economist at Norwest Corp. Minneapolis holds that the recent stock-market volatility increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news from recent trade deficit employment and housing reports .
The consensus calls for a 0.5 % increase in September personal income and a 0.3 % gain in consumption .
In August personal income rose 0.4 % and personal consumption increased 0.9 % .
Charles Lieberman managing director of financial markets reasearch at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. New York said Hurrican Hugo shaved 0.1 % to 0.2 % from personal-income growth because of greatly diminished rental income from tourism .
Durable goods orders for September due out tomorrow are expected to show a slip of 1 % compared with August 's 3.9 % increase .
As usual estimates on the fickle report are wide running from a drop of 3.5 % to a gain of 1.6 % .

When Rune Andersson set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants .
All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology electronics or biotechnology and get out of mature basic industries Mr. Andersson recalls .
Yet under its 45-year-old president Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division later adding mining as well as building and construction materials .
It was a gutsy move for a little-known executive fired after only two months as president of his pre
