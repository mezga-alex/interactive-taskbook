dvising that the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance .
Many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views .
But Mr. Rivkin insists that the 10 pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish .
Instead he says they were cautious and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver on Monday .
As Mr. Rivkin explains it We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in Europe and concerns about the LBO market .
And by late Friday afternoon actually after the close we decided that was the wrong tone to take .
With the market down we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening .
Both before and after the Friday plunge Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65 % stocks 20 % bonds and 15 % cash .
Sheldon B. Lubar chairman of Lubar & Co. and John L. Murray chairman of Universal Foods Corp. were elected to the board of this engine maker .
They succeed Robert W. Kasten and John R. Parker who reached the mandatory retirement age .
China 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall .
In a report on China 's foundering economy the official State Statistical Bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9 % from a year earlier the lowest growth rate in a decade for September .
Retail sales are plummeting while consumer prices still are rising .
Chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation low growth and high inflation .
The economy is crashing hard says an Asian economist in Beijing .
The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected .
A lengthy recession if it materializes would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers .
Experts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit .
Unless the government suddenly reverses course wages for most workers wo n't keep pace with inflation creating a potential source of urban unrest .
The economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in September 1988 to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation .
Industrial output surged 21 % in 1988 while inflation peaked last February at nearly 30 % .
The slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw-materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week .
In Western market-driven countries recessions often have a bright side prodding the economy to greater efficiency .
In China however there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state .
Instead China is likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run enterprises which ate up 18 billion in bailouts last year .
Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt .
Rather the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private township enterprises which have fallen into disfavor as China 's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership .
When the going gets rough China penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent says a Western economist .
Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major Communist Party plenum for sometime in the next few weeks .
The meeting is expected to call for heightened austerity for two years .
But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy .
Some analysts believe China soon will begin relaxing economic controls particularly by loosening credit .
That would benefit Chinese enterprises as well as Sino-foreign joint ventures both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital .
A dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens if unchecked to bring the economy to a collapse .
One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of People 's Bank of China the central bank to allocate 5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest the official China Daily reported .
But while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation .
The cycle has been repeated several times since China began reforming its planned economy in 1979 .
And because China 's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy it is likely to continue analysts say .
The statistical bureau 's report cited in China Daily notes that industrial output in September totaled 29.4 billion a rise of just 0.9 % from a year earlier .
Output declined in several provinces including Jiangsu and Zhejiang two key coastal areas and Sichuan the nation 's agricultural breadbasket .
Production in Shanghai China 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government fell 1.8 % for the month .
Nationwide output of light industrial products declined 1.8 % the first decline in 10 years a bureau spokesman told China Daily .
In an unusually direct statement the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they can purchase manufacturers ' goods .
This will prevent a slide in industrial production which will otherwise cause new panic buyings the spokesman said .
The 1986 tax overhaul the biggest achievement of President Reagan 's second term is beginning to fall apart and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over Capitol Hill .
Real-estate executives are lobbying to ease anti-tax-shelter rules .
Charitable groups are trying to reinstate the write-off for contributions made by individuals who do n't itemize their deductions .
Big auction houses want to make collectibles eligible for lower capital-gains taxes .
And heavy-industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax credit .
Everything is up for grabs says Theodore Groom a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies .
Adds Robert Juliano the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again .
The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress .
Other fundamental reforms of the 1986 act have been threatened as well .
The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes .
The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts and also to bring back income averaging for farmers a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years .
As part of the same bill the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations in what committee member Sen. David Pryor D. Ark .
calls a feeding frenzy of special-interest legislating .
The beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops .
To be sure the full Senate facing a fast-approaching budget deadline last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill .
But lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary .
Other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts including both the capital-gains and IRA provisions .
There is n't any doubt that the thread of the '86 code has been given a mighty tug says Rep. Thomas Downey D. N.Y .
.
You 'll see the annual unraveling of it .
It 's back to tax-give-away time for the select few says Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania the third-ranking Democrat in the House .
Referring to the chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees he adds Next year every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on Lloyd Bentsen 's door on Danny Rostenkowski 's door .
Many groups are n't waiting that long .
Just last week a House Ways and Means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities companies and interest groups who want to open their own special loopholes .
It 's a Swiss-cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings .
Even lobbyists for heavy industry one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill are encouraged .
The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation write-offs or investment credits says Paul Huard a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers .
Corporate lobbyist Charls Walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve competitiveness .
In reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation groups are lobbying to make sure they are n't left off the gravy train .
Real-estate interests for example are protesting an omission in President Bush 's capital-gains proposal It does n't include real-estate gains .
If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains they certainly want to be part of it says real-estate lobbyist Wayne Thevenot of Concord Associates .
In the House-passed tax bill Mr. Thevenot got his wish real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision .
But Sotheby 's Christie 's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs .
They have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment .
Collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets the letter states .
All of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 .
In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others .
The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes .
Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses also known as passive losses that made many tax shelters possible .
Many other tax benefits also were swept away .
This year Congress with prodding from President Bush has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code .
It appears likely that this year or next some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted .
Other tax benefits probably will be restored and created .
The main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them .
The '86 act was a fluke .
They wanted reform and they got a revolution says overhaul advocate Rep. Willis Gradison R. Ohio .
So is the tax code now open game again .
Mr. Juliano thinks so .
One recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to San Francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of Chicago for the 30th reunion of St. Ignatius High School .
I 'm too old to waste a weekend but that 's what I did the 48-year-old Mr. Juliano moans .
These days anything can happen .
Lufthansa AG said passenger volume climbed 5.2 % for the first nine months of 1989 to 15.3 million passengers from 14.5 million passengers in the year-earlier period .
The West German national air carrier said cargo volume jumped 12 % to 638,000 metric tons from 569,000 tons a year ago .
Load factor or percentage of seats filled climbed to 67.1 % from 66.6 % even though the number of flights rose 6.9 % to 215,845 in the first-three quarters .
From January through September the distance flown by Lufthansa airplanes rose 5.6 % to 266.2 million kilometers from a year earlier the company added .
Raymond Chandler in a 1950 letter defending a weak Hemingway book likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher .
When the champ has lost his stuff the great mystery novelist wrote when he can no longer throw the high hard one he throws his heart instead .
He throws something .
He does n't just walk off the mound and weep .
Chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career .
His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe the inferior Playback 1958 at times read almost like a parody of his previous work .
When he died in 1959 Chandler left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book The Poodle Springs Story which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque .
Champ Chandler 's last pitch apparently was a screwball .
Now Robert Parker author of several best sellers featuring Spenser a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired to complete The Poodle Springs Story .
The result Poodle Springs Putnam 's 288 pages 18.95 is an entertaining easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color .
If it does not quite have Chandler 's special magic well at the end neither did Chandler .
As the book begins a newly Marlowe roars into the desert resort of Poodle a.k.a .
Palm Springs at the wheel of a Cadillac Fleetwood .
His bride is the rich and beautiful Linda Loring a character who also appeared in Chandler 's The Long Goodbye and Playback .
Philip and Linda move into her mansion and ca n't keep their hands off each other even in front of the Hawaiian\/Japanese houseman .
But the lovebirds have a conflict .
He wants to continue being a low-paid private eye and she wants him to live off the million dollars she 's settled on him .
That 's Chandler 's setup .
Mr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds .
The supporting lineup is solid the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls the good cop of previous Chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes .
The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler 's prose at its most pared down .
All told Mr. Parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect .
But there are grounds for complaint .
At one point the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro .
More bothersome there are several apparent anachronisms .
Contact lenses tank tops prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s .
A little more care in re-creating Marlowe 's universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable .
Mr. Nolan is a contributing editor at Los Angeles Magazine .
Ko Shioya spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of Reader 's Digest .
Japan has been a major importer of foreign information and news says Mr. Shioya .
But one gets fed up with importing information and news .
Mr. Shioya has turned the tables .
Today he is publisher of Business Tokyo magazine the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business .
After a slick redesign the two-year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company Keizaikai Corp. the Tokyo-based company with interests that include financial services book publishing and a tourist agency .
Printed in the U.S. and carrying the line The Insider 's Japan Business Tokyo 's October cover story was The World 's No. 1 Customer Japanese women .
Keizaikai is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing after making major investments in entertainment real estate and banking companies here .
Japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers to study the U.S. market including the New York-based investment banker Veronis Suhler & Associates .
And they are quietly linking up with U.S. publishing trade groups .
Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries said John Veronis chairman of Veronis Suhler .
While there are n't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of Sony Corp. 's recent 3.4 billion agreement to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. observers do n't rule out a transaction of that size .
The Japanese take the long view .
said Mr. Veronis .
It may not be weeks or months but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable they will move on a deal he said .
In recent months three big Tokyo-based publishing concerns including Nikkei Business Publications Nikkei Home no relation and Magazine House applied for membership in Magazine Publishers of America which represents almost all U.S. consumer magazines .
Japanese involvement in American publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as Business Tokyo are considered groundbreakers .
When Keizaikai launched Business Tokyo in 1987 it appealed to a more multinational audience .
The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers .
American publishers appear more than ready to do some selling .
Susumu Ohara president of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc. publisher of the Japan Economic Journal said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine .
The Japanese are in the early stage right now said Thomas Kenney a onetime media adviser for First Boston Corp. who was recently appointed president of Reader 's Digest Association 's new Magazine Publishing Group .
Before they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft .
Now they realize magazines are as much a franchise as Nabisco is a franchise .
Bell Atlantic Corp. and Southern New England Telecommunications posted strong profit gains for the third quarter while Nynex Corp. Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. reported earnings declines for the period .
Rate settlements in Minnesota and Colorado depressed U S West 's third-quarter profit .
Denver-based U S West said net income dropped 8.9 % noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its BetaWest Properties unit .
Revenue dropped 4.3 % to 2.3 billion from 2.4 billion reflecting declines in its consumer-telephone sector long-distance carrier business and diversified division .
Revenue from business-telephone operations grew 3.3 % to 618.9 million from 599.4 million a year ago .
New telephone lines posted healthy growth .
Overall they increased 2.8 % to 12.1 million putting U S West over the 12 million mark for the first time .
Business lines increased 3.7 % to 3.3 million .
On a truly comparable basis we 've seen modest earnings growth this year from the operations of our company said Jack MacAllister chairman and chief executive officer .
The major negative factor was the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years .
He said the company expects to be on target with analysts ' projections by year end but conceded that the fourth quarter represents a significant challenge .
Expenses in the quarter dropped 11.2 % to 664.3 million from 747.7 million a year ago .
Yesterday U S West shares rose 75 cents to close at 71.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic said net rose 6.5 % aided by strong growth in the network-services business and an increase in the number of new telephone lines .
Revenue jumped 5.6 % to 2.9 billion from 2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter .
Revenue from financial and real-estate services jumped 23 % to 177.4 million from 144.1 million a year ago .
Network-access revenue from long-distance telephone companies increased 6.4 % to 618.6 million .
Bell Atlantic added 148,000 new telephone lines in the quarter for a total of 16.9 million .
The company said per-share earnings were slightly reduced by the sale of 4.1 million shares of treasury stock to the company 's newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plans .
In composite trading on the Big Board Bell Atlantic closed at 100.625 up 1.50 a share .
At Nynex net slumped 14.8 % primarily because of a continuing strike by 60,000 employees lower-than-expected profit at its New York Telephone unit and significantly higher taxes and costs .
State and local taxes increased to 131.3 million from 99.1 million a year ago .
Nynex said expenses rose 4.5 % to 2.73 billion from 2.61 billion a 119 million increase .
Most of the higher costs were associated with acquisitions and growth in nonregulated business units it added .
Our net income is n't where we would want it to be at this point said William C. Ferguson chairman and chief executive officer .
This deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at New York Telephone .
Mr. Ferguson said a continued softness in New York City area 's economy and increased competition particularly in the private-line market took a heavy toll on earnings .
The three-month-old strike at Nynex seriously hurt the installation of new telephone lines in the quarter .
Nynex said access lines in service at the end of the quarter were off 18,000 from the previous quarter which reported an increase of 160,000 new access lines .
Revenue rose to 3.31 billion from 3.18 billion mostly from acquisition of AGS Computers and robust non-regulated businesses .
In Big Board composite trading yesterday Nynex common closed at 81.125 up 1.625 .
Southern New England Telecommunications which bolstered its marketing efforts for telephone and non-telephone subsidiaries reported that net increased 8.1 % .

Revenue and sales increased 7.5 % to 423.9 million from 394.4 million a year earlier .
Yellow pages advertising sales rose 11.8 % to 41.2 million .
Cost and expenses for the quarter excluding interest increased 6.1 % to 333.3 million from 314 million the year before .
SNET common rose 1.25 to 85.50 a share yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board .
San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis said net declined 12.6 % primarily because of regulatory action .
Revenue was about flat at 2.4 billion .
Revenue was reduced 33 million by three extraordinary items a California Public Utilities Commission refund for an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. billing adjustment a provision for productivity sharing to be paid to customers in 1990 and a one-time accrual for a toll settlement with long-distance telephone companies .
Excluding the one-time charges the company would have posted earnings of 298 million or 73 cents a share .
The company also was hurt by a 289 million rate reduction that went into effect in 1989 .
This is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals said Sam Ginn chairman and chief executive officer .
Pacific Telesis said new telephone lines increased 4.5 % for a total of about 13.5 million for the quarter toll calls increased 9.6 % to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion .
In Big Board composite trading yesterday Pacific Telesis common closed at 45.50 up 87.5 cents .
a Includes a one-time gain of 88.7 million from a commonstock sale by U S West 's U S West New Vector Group .
b Includes a 41.3 million gain on the sale of FiberCom .
Amoco Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 39 % to 336 million or 65 cents a share as gasoline refining and marketing profits lagged substantially behind last year 's record level .
A charge of 80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results .
A spokesman said Amoco completed an environmental analysis last quarter but that no single clean-up project was responsible .
In the 1988 third quarter the Chicago-based oil company earned 552 million or 1.07 a share .
Revenue in the latest quarter rose 12 % to 6.6 billion from 5.91 billion .
Aside from the special charge Amoco 's results were in line with Wall Street estimates .
The company 's stock ended at 48.375 up 25 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Amoco is the first major oil company to report third-quarter results .
Analysts expect others to show a similar pattern .
Generally in the quarter overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability .
The industry 's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity has depressed prices .
Gasoline margins may rebound this quarter some industry officials say but they believe chemical margins could worsen .
American Petrofina Inc. a Dallas-based integrated oil company yesterday said its third-quarter earnings declined by more than half .
Fina blamed lower chemical prices reduced gasoline margins and refinery maintenance shutdowns .
It said net income dropped to 15.1 million or 98 cents a share from 35.2 million or 2.66 a share .
Sales rose 2.2 % to 711.9 million from 696.1 million .
Amoco 's refining and marketing profit in the quarter fell to 134 million from 319 million .
Chemical earnings declined by one-third to 120 million last year 's robust levels .
Amoco 's domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of 104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of 5 million primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices said Chairman Richard M. Morrow .
Amoco also sharply boosted natural-gas output part of it from properties acquired from Tenneco Inc. last year .
But foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply to 12 million from 95 million .
Higher oil prices were n't enough to offset a roughly 20 million charge related to a 10 % reduction in Amoco 's Canadian work force as well as increased exploration expenses .
For the nine months Amoco said that net income fell to 1.29 billion from 1.69 billion but if unusual items are excluded operations produced essentially flat results .
Revenue rose 12 % to 19.93 billion from 17.73 billion .
James F. Gero former chairman and chief executive officer of Varo Inc. and Richard J. Hatchett III a Dallas investment banker were elected directors of this medical-products concern boosting the board to seven members .
For retailers Christmas not Halloween promises to be this year 's spookiest season .
Many retailers fear a price war will erupt if cash-strapped companies such as Campeau Corp. slash tags to spur sales .
Concerns about the stock market doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also haunt store operators .
Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer asserts Norman Abramson president and chief operating officer of Clothestime Inc. an off-price chain .
Even if there is n't any widespread discounting the outlook for industry profits is n't good .
Management Horizons forecasts a 1.4 % profit decline for non-auto retailers this year after annual drops that averaged 4.5 % in 1988 and 1987 .
For the last two and a half years retailing has been in a mild recession says Carl Steidtmann chief economist at the Columbus Ohio consulting firm .
This year many stores are entering the Christmas season in turmoil Bonwit Teller and B. Altman parent L.J. Hooker Corp. is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code B.A.T Industries PLC 's healthy Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field 's chains are on the auction block Campeau 's Bloomingdale 's is also on the block .
Industry observers expect a wide divergence in performance .
Stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly and to lose customers to stable chains such as Limited Inc. May Department Stores Co. and Dillard Department Stores Inc. which should do well .
There are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers says Cynthia Turk a Touche Ross & Co. retail consultant .
Says Mr. Steidtmann I 'm looking for a bi-polar Christmas .
Economists expect general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter to rise 4.5 % to 6 % from year-ago figures .
But Mr. Steidtmann predicts that healthy stores hawking mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as 25 % to 30 % .
Troubled chains could see their sales drop as much as 8 % he believes as managers distracted by fears about the future allow their stores to get sloppy .
Thin merchandise selections at the most troubled chains are also expected to hurt sales .
Catalog companies are likely to pose a bigger threat to all stores this year particularly in December .
More than 200 catalog outfits are promoting a low-cost Federal Express service that guarantees pre-Christmas delivery of orders made by a certain date .
Traditionally consumers were concerned about ordering after the first of December because they did n't believe they would get it by Christmas says Adam Strum chairman of the Wine Enthusiast Inc. which sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail .
Using Federal Express delivery last year Mr. Strum says December was our biggest month .
Even Sears Roebuck & Co. is getting into the act offering for the first time to have Federal Express deliver toys ordered by Dec. 20 from its Wish Book catalog .
K mart Corp. Chairman Joseph E. Antonini summed up his outlook for the Christmas season as not troublesome .
He 's not predicting a blockbuster but he is more optimistic than three months ago because employment remains strong and inflation low .
Other retailers are also preparing for a ho-hum holiday .
Philip M. Hawley chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. expects sales at department stores op
