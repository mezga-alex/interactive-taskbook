Quantum stopped shipping the drugs last month following a federal investigation regarding information the company supplied to obtain three drug approvals .

Lyondell Petrochemical Co. said third-quarter net income fell 54 % to 73 million or 91 cents a share from 160 million a year earlier .
Year-earlier per-share results are n't applicable because the company went public in January .
Revenue rose 7.7 % to 1.28 billion from 1.18 billion .
The petrochemical maker said the biggest reason earnings declined was a loss of production time and the increased costs associated with a temporary maintenance closing and expansion of an olefins plant .
Like other refiners Lyondell 's margins for chemicals and gasoline were narrower .
While the company said chemical margins continued to worsen this quarter costs will be lower because the maintenance and expansions are complete .

In East Germany where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism they 're not laughing about their new leader Egon Krenz .
Mr. Krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him .
You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes says an East German mother of two who loves swapping political barbs with her friends .
With Krenz we just do n't know what to expect .
Mr. Krenz does n't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old Politburo member was selected last week to succeed Erich Honecker .
But he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either .
According to East Germany 's ADN news agency Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged East Germany could learn from Moscow 's glasnost policies .
Already last week Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media .
On Thursday a day after he took office East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer .
The regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet-style glasnost .
It was quite a shock says a 43-year-old East German shopkeeper .
For the first time in my life I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television .
Other changes including easing restrictions on travel for East Germans are expected .
But whether such moves can win back the confidence of East Germans who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes depends largely on whether they feel they can trust Mr. Krenz .
And that 's a problem .
Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor Mr. Honecker but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators .
I hope he grows with the job says Rainer Eppelmann a Protestant pastor in East Berlin .
The most important thing is that he have
