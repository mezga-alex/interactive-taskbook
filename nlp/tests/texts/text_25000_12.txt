r-share earnings on nearly flat revenue for its third quarter .
The aerospace and financial services concern said net income fell 5 % to 59.5 million from 62.8 million .
Revenue of 1.73 billion was almost unchanged from last year 's 1.72 billion .
Per-share net of 66 cents down from 72 cents fell by more than overall net because of more shares outstanding .
The company said that improved results in its financial-services sector were negated by increased costs in its government contract business lower operating earnings in its commercial-products sector and soft automotive markets .
Net was aided by a lower income tax rate .
Profit before taxes fell 17 % to 84.4 million from 101.4 million .
For the nine months Textron reported net of 182.1 million or 2.06 a share on revenue of 5.41 billion .
A year ago net was 170.4 million or 1.93 a share on revenue of 5.3 billion .
The nine-month results included a 9.5 million special charge in 1989 for an arbitration settlement related to past export sales and 29.7 million in extraordinary charges in 1988 related to a former line of business and early redemption of debt .
Textron said that nine-months ' results do n't include earnings of Avdel PLC a British maker of industrial fasteners but do include interest costs of 16.4 million on borrowings related to the proposed purchase of Avdel .
A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the purchase because of Federal Trade Commission concerns that the transaction would reduce competition in the production of two kinds of rivets .
For the quarter Textron said aerospace revenue including Bell helicopter and jet-engine manufacture declined 9.8 % to 755.9 million from 838.3 million an indication of slowing government defense work .
As the Hunt brothers ' personal bankruptcy cases sputter into their second year Minpeco S.A. has proposed a deal to settle its huge claim against the troubled Texas oil men .
But the plan only threatens to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in September 1988 .
The Peruvian mineral concern 's 251 million claim stems from 1988 jury award in a case stemming from the brothers ' alleged attempts to corner the 1979-80 silver market .
Minpeco now says it is willing to settle for up to 65.7 million from each brother although the actual amount would probably be much less .
Although the proposal must be approved by federal Judge Harold C. Abramson W. Herbert Hunt has agreed to the Peruvian mineral concern 's proposal .
Nelson Bunker Hunt is considering it although his attorney says he wo n't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement he has reached with the Internal Revenue Service which claims the brothers owe 1 billion in back taxes and is by far the biggest creditor in both cases .
The tentative agreement between the IRS and Nelson Bunker Hunt is awaiting U.S. Justice Department approval .
Under it the former billionaire 's assets would be liquidated with the IRS getting 80 % of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other creditors including Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. which is seeking repayment of a 36 million loan .
A similiar proposal has been made in the W. Herbert Hunt case although he and the IRS are at odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt he would have to pay to the government from future earnings .
In both cases Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie .
With support from the IRS Manufacturers Hanover has filed suit asking Judge Abramson to subordinate Minpeco 's claim to those of Manufacturer Hanover and the IRS .
Minpeco has threatened a volcano of litigation if the Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit attempts to force such a plan through the court .
Minpeco said it would n't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the W. Herbert Hunt case is approved by Judge Abramson who will consider the proposal at a hearing next week .
Minpeco attorney Thomas Gorman decribed the plan as one step toward an overall settlement of the W. Herbert Hunt case but Hugh Ray attorney for Manufacturers Hanover called it silly and said he would fight it in court .
The thing is so fluid right now that there 's really no way to say what will happen says Justice Department attorney Grover Hartt III who represents the IRS in the case .
Developments like this are hard to predict .
Banc One Corp. said it agreed in principle to buy five branch offices from Trustcorp Inc. Toledo Ohio following the planned merger of Trustcorp into Society Corp. Cleveland .
The five offices in Erie and Ottawa counties in northern Ohio have total assets of about 88 million Banc One said .
The purchase price will be established after Banc One has an opportunity to study the quality of the assets Banc One said .
Society Corp. already has branches in the area and selling the Trustcorp offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of Trustcorp into Society according to industry sources .
The merger is scheduled to take place in the 1990 first quarter .
Stock-market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money-market mutual fund assets up 6.07 billion in the latest week the sharpest increase in almost two years .
The 473 funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute a Washington-based trade group rose to 356.1 billion a record .
The 6.07 billion increase was the strongest weekly inflow since January 1988 .
The increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds .
Individual investors represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds said Jacob Dreyer vice president and chief economist of the Institute .
Insitutional investors on the other hand reacted to the steep decline in yields on direct money-market instruments following the stock-market decline last Friday Mr. Dreyer said .
Yields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday according to Donoghue 's Money Fund Report a Holliston Mass. newsletter .
The average seven-day compounded yield fell to 8.55 % from 8.60 % the week earlier Donoghue 's said .
At the auction of six-month U.S. Treasury bills on Monday the average yield fell to 7.61 % from 7.82 % .
Likewise certificates of deposit on average posted lower yields in the week ended Tuesday .
The 142 institutional-type money funds rose 2.23 billion to 85.49 billion .
The 235 general-purpose funds increased 2.53 billion to 116.56 billion while 96 broker-dealer funds increased 1.3 billion to 154.05 billion .
Domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd. 's most recent spate of financial troubles the institution 's executive chairman Mohamed Basir Ismail said .
Speaking to reporters this week after Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders approved a rescue plan Tan Sri Basir said heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in Malaysia plummeted in 1984-85 .
He said the bank could n't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans .
So the bank 's board decided to make 1.23 billion Malaysian dollars 457 million in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank and to submit a bailout package to replenish the bank 's paid-up capital .
The predicament he added was similar to the Hong Kong 1982-83 property-price collapse which exposed the involvement of Bank Bumiputra 's former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in Malaysia 's history .
The subsidiary Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd. was left with 2.26 billion in bad loans made to Hong Kong property speculators .
Both episodes wiped out Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders ' funds .
Each time the bank 's 90 % shareholder Petroliam Nasional Bhd. or Petronas the national oil company has been called upon to rescue the institution .
In five years Petronas which became the dominant shareholder in a 1984 rescue exercise has spent about 3.5 billion to prop up the troubled bank .
Tan Sri Basir said the capital restructuring plan has been approved by Malaysia 's Capital Issues Committee and central bank .
Malaysia 's High Court is expected to approve the plan .
Once the plan is approved Tan Sri Basir said most of Bank Bumiputra 's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between 160 million and 170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31 .
For the previous financial year the bank would have reported a pretax profit of 168 million if it had n't made provisions for the nonperforming loans he said .
Malaysia 's Banking Secrecy Act prohibited the bank from identifying delinquent borrowers said Tan Sri Basir .
But public documents indicate 10 % or more of the bank 's provisions were made for foregone interest on a 200 million loan to Malaysia 's dominant political party the United Malays National Organization to build its convention and headquarters complex in Kuala Lumpur .
The loan to UMNO was made in September 1983 .
We lent a lot of money all over the place said Tan Sri Basir who refused to discuss the bank 's outstanding loans to As well as the 1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6 the restructuring package covers an additional 450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank 's paid-up capital .
At the end of the exercise the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank 's paid-up capital to 1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions .
Heidi Ehman might have stepped from a recruiting poster for young Republicans .
White 24 years old a singer in her church choir she symbolizes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to Ronald Reagan .
I felt kind of safe she says .
No longer .
When the Supreme Court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion Ms. Ehman opened her mind to Democratic politics .
Then a political novice she stepped into a whirl of pro-choice marches house parties and fund-raisers .
Now she leads a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in Passaic County for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio .
This is one where I cross party lines she says rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. Florio 's opponent Reagan-Republican Rep. James Courter .
People my age thought it was n't going to be an issue .
Now it has especially for people my age .
Polls bear out this warning but after a decade of increased Republican influence here the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter .
Unless he closes the gap Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month .
Going into the 1990s the GOP is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment Democrats in the past .
This change comes less from a shift in public opinion which has n't changed much on abortion over the past decade than in the boundaries of the debate .
New Jersey 's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion but the U.S. Supreme Court ruling Webster vs. Missouri has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue .
Before July pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion .
Now the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces .
A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands and in a major reversal Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest .
If Webster had n't happened you would n't be here Linda Bowker tells a reporter in the Trenton office of the National Organization for Women .
We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter and no one would have heard us .
New Jersey is a proving ground for this aggressive women's-rights movement this year .
The infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures .
In Cherry Hill the National Abortion Rights Action League whose goal is to sign up 50,000 pro-choice voters targets a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause .
The league organizers seem more a fit with a convention next door of young aerobics instructors in leotards than the beefy union leaders I wish I could go work out says a slim activist .
A labor chief speaks sardonically of having to man and woman Election Day phones .
No age group is more sensitive than younger voters like Ms. Ehman .
A year ago this fall New Jersey voters under 30 favored George Bush by 56 % to 39 % over Michael Dukakis according to a survey then by Rutgers University 's Eagleton Institute .
A matching Eagleton-Newark Star Ledger poll last month showed a complete reversal .
Voters in the same age group backed Democrat Florio 55 % to 29 % over Republican Courter .
Abortion alone ca n't explain this shift but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate .
By a 2-to-1 ratio voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio 's stance on abortion and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue .
The times are my times says Mr. Florio .
The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark I'm-coming-down-your-throat intensity but at a pause in Newark 's Columbus Day parade recently he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city 's old Italian-American ward .
After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor 's race he has prepared himself methodically for this moment including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions .
If you 're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right he asks how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not .
Mr. Courter by comparison seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran-Contra hearings two years ago .
Looking back he says he erred by stating his personal opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he would n't impose his views on policy as governor .
It is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate .
He does n't know himself Kathy Stanwick of the Abortion Rights League says of Mr. Courter 's position .
Even abortion opponents however angry with Mr. Florio ca n't hide their frustration with the Republican 's ambivalence .
He does n't want to lead the people says Richard Traynor president of New Jersey Right to Life .
Moreover by stepping outside the state 's pro-choice tradition Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment .
He hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate and by wavering on this issue and abortion he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides .
Elected to Congress in 1978 the 48-year-old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan .
Like many of his colleagues he did n't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors .
Jack Kemp and the writers Irving Kristol and George Gilder were influences and Mr. Courter 's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current New Jersey GOP governor Thomas Kean in the 1981 Republican primary here .
The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter 's fortunes but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate pro-choice Gov. Kean .
While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government anti-tax agenda in Washington Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey 's budget in his eight years in office .
Kean forces play down any differences with Mr. Courter but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government .
Mr. Courter 's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov. Kean 's own insurance commissioner .
Mr. Courter is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers .
Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head .
He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park .
Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office .
I do n't think we do now he says .
I think we did .
Asked the same question after his appearance Democrat Florio identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today .
When he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization 's 20th anniversary he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in Camden .
Details and Camden are essential Florio .
Elected to Congress as a Watergate baby in 1974 he ran for governor three years later .
In the opinion of many he has n't stopped running since even though he declined a rematch with Gov. Kean in 1985 .
His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge .
With limited budgets for television in a high-priced market Mr. Florio 's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage .
More than ever his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the state .
Auto insurance rates are soaring .
A toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer .
In Monmouth an important swing area Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county clean and green .
Mr. Florio savors this vindication but at age 52 the congressman is also a product of his times and losses .
He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 to increase state revenue he focuses not on taxes but on audits to cut waste .
Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s .
Appealing to a young audience he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead .
The lyric chosen long strange night may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar .
The Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county 's past corruption .
His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater Trenton State College .
Mr. Florio 's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the Webster ruling divides some of his old constituency .
Pasquale Pignatelli an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an Essex County Irish bagpipe band speaks sadly of Mr. Florio .
I am a devout Catholic says Mr. Pignatelli a 40-year-old health officer .
I ca n't support him because of abortion .
Bill Wames Sr. 72 is Catholic too but unfazed by Mr. Florio 's stand on abortion .
A security guard at a cargo terminal he wears a Sons of Italy jacket and cap celebrating The US 1 Band .
I still think the woman has the right to do with her body as she pleases he says .
If you want more opinions ask my wife .
She has lots of opinions .
Consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate 0.2 % in September pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs the Labor Department reported .
Energy costs which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month continued to decline at the retail level pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs .
The report was the brightest news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than 190 points last Friday .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on the news closing 39.55 points higher at 2683.20 .
Bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall .
But many economists were not nearly as jubilant .
The climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months they warned .
They also said the dollar is leveling off after a rise this summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods .
I think inflation is going to pick up through the fall said Joel Popkin a specialist on inflation who runs an economic consulting firm here .
It has been in what I would describe as a lull for the past several months .
We 've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now said Jay Woodworth chief domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. in New York .
Because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep 6.5 % last month many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too .
As a result many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did .
But retail energy prices declined 0.9 % in September .
Though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year .
Still some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind .
It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem argued Edward Yardeni chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York .
In both 1987 and 1988 consumer prices rose 4.4 % .
A run-up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7 % annual rate in the first five months of this year but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4 % .
Mr. Yardeni predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices .
The bottom line is it seems to me that the economic environment has become very very competitve for a lot of businesses he said .
Back in 1987-88 business was operating at fairly tight capacity so businesses felt they could raise prices .
Now he said a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand .
The mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance .
The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's 6.9 % plunge that day .
In the past several days however the U.S. 's central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets .
Analysts say Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy .
Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate consumer prices still rose only 0.2 % in September .
Transportation costs actually fell 0.5 % and housing costs gained only 0.1 % .
Apparel prices rocketed up 1.7 % but that was after three months of declines .
Medical costs continued their steep ascent rising 0.8 % after four consecutive months of 0.7 % increases .
Car prices another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month still showed declines at the consumer level .
They dropped 0.4 % as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers .
Food prices rose 0.2 % for the second month in a row far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year .
Separately the Labor Department reported that average weekly earnings rose 0.3 % in September after adjusting for inflation following a 0.7 % decline in August .
All the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations .
Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department 's consumer price index for September .
After watching interest in the sport plummet for years the ski industry is trying to give itself a lift .
Across the country resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical-music concerts to attract new customers .
Some have built health spas business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more to do than ski .
And this week the i
