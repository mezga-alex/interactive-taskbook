k portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue .
Note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return 10.1 % vs. 8.8 % as calculated by Seidman Financial Services which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman .
That largely reflects the heavy stockholdings .
But one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility as reflected in the higher standard deviation that Seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio .
Here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it .
Then take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation .
In two of three years the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate .
Then add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range .
There 's a 95 % probability any year 's result will fall in the range .
Of course the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals .
Indeed the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans .
They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market says John H. Cammack a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington .
But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future .
Ms. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau .
When it comes to investing trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver or the ups and downs that will occur along the way .
Looking to the past can provide some clues .
Over several decades for instance investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and cash investments like Treasury bills .
But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself .
For instance some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market .
And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past .

A letter from Senator John Kerry chides us today for implying that he had flip-flopped on Manuel Noriega .
He correctly says he has been down on Noriega for some time hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup .
Our October 12 editorial should have been more precise .
It meant to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega to include other notorious Central American drug runners .
The Sandinistas of Nicaragua for example also are part of the Castro-Medellin cartel nexus .
In his letter and on the basis of his losing vote Tuesday against U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan opposition Senator Kerry makes clear he has not made that intellectual leap .
We were wrong .
THROUGHOUT THE 1980s investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning .
Capital has been democratized and people want in .
Too often however small investors are left with the same stale solutions that appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists .
Now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit .
This is particularly good news for those who hate risk who are incapable of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way .
You know who you are .
My revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion .
Like all Americans seeking chronic prosperity I do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools if only to assuage my father-in-law who believes in such things .
So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs and tinkered with stocks bonds and mutual funds as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market .
Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative .
Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I 've invested in during this prosperous decade see accompanying illustration WSJ Oct. 20 1989 .
Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 at which point the industry while not lighting up any Christmas trees began a slow recovery .
Likewise mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was for me a serious investment .
By 1987 these properties were in a tailspin causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she 'd never seen anything like it .
Concerned for her state of mind I dropped them and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health .
Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years .
Disgusted I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me I was doing it already .
We 've all got money to spend some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it .
Bank it .
Not really .
Sock it away in long-term instruments .
Nonsense .
Daily living is the best possible investment .
Your priorities may be different but here in Figure 2 is where I 've chosen to build for the future personal space automotive pursuits children 's toys gardening equipment bulbs and shrubs and finally entertainment perhaps the best investment of all .
All have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential .
At least according to my calculations .
Personal space Figure 3 has grown 35 % annually over the course of the decade a performance that would compare positively with an investment in say synthetic-leather products for the interiors of cold-weather vehicles which my cousin got into and sort of regrets to this day .
The assortment of expensive children 's toys that I have purchased wisely at a host of discount-toy brokerage firms Figure 4 has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except perhaps for my record collection whose worth I think it 's safe to say is incalculable .
Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy Figure 5 with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value .
According to my calculations these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than 22,000 on the open market Figure 6 where I plan to offer it shortly .
Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale .
I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers .
My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold according to my conservative calculations .
At the same time my share in a wide variety of entertainment pursuits has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning .
Over the course of the decade for instance my return on investment in the area of poker alone Figures 7A and 7B has been most impressive showing bodacious annual expansion with given the way my associates play no sign of abatement into the 1990s and beyond .
With this personal strategy firmly in place I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage .
My kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending although I 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it .
But with every step I take I 'm building wealth .
You can too if you like me refuse to bite the bullet .
So go out there and eat that debt .
You 're right there in the mainstream of American business building value on the back of insupportable expenditures .
Henry Kravis watch out .
Mr. Schwartz is a business executive and writer in New York .
WHEN JAMES SCHWARTZ was just a lad his father gave him a piece of career advice .
He told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre I could be great recalls Mr. Schwartz now 40 .
He tried management consulting traded in turquoise for a while and even managed professional wrestlers .
Now he has settled into a career that fits the bill financial planning .
It should be noted that Mr. Schwartz who operates out of Englewood Colo. is a puckish sort who likes to give his colleagues the needle .
But in this case the needle has a very sharp point .
Though it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent the fact remains that as one wag puts it anybody who can fog a mirror can call himself a financial planner .
Planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars but in effect they operate in the dark .
There is no effective regulation of planners no accepted standard for admission into their ranks a dog got into one trade group no way to assess their performance no way even to know how many of them there are estimates range from 60,000 to 450,000 .
All anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning .
So it should come as no shock that the profession if that 's what it is has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients ' money .
Alarmed state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners .
Industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards too they 're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine .
But reform has n't taken hold yet .
The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days says Scott Stapf director of investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Association .
An admittedly limited survey by NASAA whose members are state securities-law regulators found that between 1986 and 1988 fraud and abuse by financial planners cost 22,000 investors 400 million .
The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons a compulsive gambler or two various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother .
What 's more the losses they and the others caused are just what we are stumbling over says Mr. Stapf adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected .
So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners .
Nobody can estimate the toll but John Gargan a Tampa Fla. planner and head of one trade group the International Association of Registered Financial Planners thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is humongous far greater than that from crookery .
His group like others wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners .
Surveying all this some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all .
For most investors the benefits just are n't worth the risks says Barbara Roper who follows financial-planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America a consumer-advocacy organization based in Washington .
She concedes that such a position is unfair to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it .
She says her group used to give tips on selecting planners check educational and experience credentials consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus but found that even some people who took these steps were still getting ripped off .
The bad news however has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning .
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business .
But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners IAFP the industry 's biggest trade group is still nearly triple what it was in 1980 and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well .
An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners and the pool of capital they influence is enormous .
A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months .
The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult if not impossible to regulate .
Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as investment advisers people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity .
The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers about the same as in 1980 even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade .
Currently a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years .
A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years .
It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem says Kathryn McGrath director of the SEC 's division of investment management .
So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers which operates in the brokerage business .
Such an organization could among other things set minimum standards for competence ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules .
The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with .
Mr. Schwartz the puckish planner from Englewood Colo. says that allowing the business to police itself would be like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank .
Mr. Gargan the Tampa planner who heads one trade group favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff .
Mr. Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP the major industry organization .
When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners Mr. Gargan 's group was excluded .
That may be because Mr. Gargan smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group enrolled his dog Beauregard as a member of the IAFP .
Then he sent the pooch 's picture with the certificate of membership it was made out to Boris Bo Regaard to every newspaper he could think of .
The states have their own ideas about regulation and certification .
NASAA the organization of state securities regulators is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states .
It requires financial planners to register with states pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest .
The most common conflict involves compensation .
NASAA estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they recommend .
The issue Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments or the ones that garner the biggest commissions .
In 1986 the New York attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp. an Albany financial-planning firm that had invested 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors .
In its notice of action the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into balanced investment portfolios instead the attorney general alleged the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings coins and Florida condos .
Those investments paid big commissions to First Meridian payments investors were never told about the attorney general alleged .
Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted .
In practice the attorney general alleged in an affidavit if an investor had access to cash the chances of being turned down by First Meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month Club .
And the attorney general added First Meridian 's president Roger V. Sala portrayed himself as a financial expert when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma work as a real-estate and insurance salesman and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth .
First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general .
Harry Manion Mr. Sala 's attorney says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general 's contentions about First Meridian 's business practices are incorrect .
As for Mr. Sala 's qualifications the snooty attorneys for the state of New York decided Mr. Sala was n't qualified because he did n't have a Harvard degree says Mr. Manion .
Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common .
Two such actions both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta could be particularly embarrassing to the industry both name J. Chandler Peterson an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP as defendant .
One suit filed by more than three dozen investors charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest .
Those companies in turn paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees the suit alleges .
The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale Ariz .
One plaintiff a doctor testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician the privilege of making additional investments with Mr. Peterson .
In affidavits each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned .
Mr. Peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors .
Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots he opened up his briefcase and dumped 1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors says Myron Diebel the bank 's president .
He said he wanted to show the color of his money recalls Mr. Diebel .
Bank officials however showed him the door and the sale never came off .
According to the suit Mr. Peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment .
They want it back .
Mr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits saying he prefers to save such responses for court .
But he does say that all of his activities have been entirely proper .
On the suit by the limited partners he says he is considering a defamation suit against t
