Dell Computer Corp. squeezed by price pressure from its larger competitors and delays in its new product line said its per-share earnings for fiscal 1990 will be half its previous forecasts .
Although the personal computer maker said it expects revenue to meet or exceed previous projections of 385 million for the year ending Jan. 28 1990 earnings are expected to be 25 cents to 35 cents a share down from previous estimates of 50 cents to 60 cents .
Earnings for fiscal 1989 were 14.4 million or 80 cents a share on sales of 257.8 million .
Results for the third quarter ending Oct. 31 are expected to be released the third week of November according to Michael Dell chairman and chief executive officer .
Mr. Dell said he does n't expect a loss in either the third or fourth quarter but said third-quarter earnings could be as low as four cents a share .
In the third quarter last year Dell had net income of 5 million or 26 cents a share on sales of 75.2 million .
Mr. Dell attributed the earnings slide to new product delays such as a laptop scheduled for September that wo n't be introduced until early November .
Some delays have been caused by a shortage of micoprocessors notably Intel Corp. 's newest chip the 486 but others apparently have been caused by Dell 's explosive growth and thinly stretched resources .
They 've got a lot of different balls in the air at the same time observes Jim Poyner a computer securities analyst with Dallas-based William K. Woodruff & Co .
Mr. Dell meanwhile concedes the company was definitely too optimistic in its expectations .
Product delays however have left Dell buffeted by harsher competition in its bread-and-butter line of desktop computers as powerhouse competitors Compaq Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. price their PCs more aggressively .
The result has been thinner margins which have been further eroded by an ambitious research and development effort and rapid overseas expansion .
Analyst James Weil of the Soundview Financial Group believes Dell 's response has been to place increased emphasis on product quality in an effort to rise above some of that price pressure .
But that has been the key to Compaq 's success he adds whereas Dell carved out its market niche as a direct seller of low-cost but reliable computers and it might be too late in the game for a shift in strategy .
In national over-the-counter trading Dell closed yesterday at 6 a share down 87.5 cents .
TransAtlantic Holdings PLC a British-based South African-controlled financial services investment group and France 's Societe Centrale Union des Assurances de Paris reached an accord effectively reducing chances of an unfriendly takeover for Sun Life Assurance Society PLC .
In a joint statement the two companies whose combined holdings equal 52.7 % of Sun Life 's ordinary shares said their agreement is aimed at reducing the uncertainty and instability for Sun Life that has resulted from two major shareholders owning a controlling interest in the company .
TransAtlantic whose Transol Investments Ltd. unit owns the largest minority stake in Sun Life has agreed not to make a takeover bid for the British life insurer without the prior consent of the French company known as UAP .

Schlumberger Ltd. New York reported third-quarter net income edged up as growth in its oil-field services sector offset a decline in interest income .
The lower interest income occurred because Schlumberger spent 1.2 billion buying back its stock last year .
Net for the oil-field services and electronic measurements and systems concern rose to 114.2 million or 48 cents a share from 112.2 million or 42 cents a share a year earlier .

The French building group Dumez S.A. said profit jumped 70 % in the first half of 1989 partly on the strength of nonrecurring gains from a share issue by its Canadian unit .
Dumez said group profit after payments to minority interests rose to 252 million francs 40.1 million from 148 million a year earlier .
Revenue rose 40 % to 13.32 billion francs from 9.53 billion .
The group noted that 75 million francs of the advance reflected a one-time gain from the June offering by its United Westburne unit in Canada .
It did n't say if its year-earlier results were influenced significantly by nonrecurring elements .
For all of 1988 Dumez had group profit of 452 million francs after payment to minority interests .
Revenue was 21.98 billion francs .
The group has n't forecast full-year earnings for 1989 although it said that its first-half results are n't a good indication because of one-time elements and the seasonal nature of its operations .
Tuesday 's earthquake will depress local real-estate values in the short term and force companies to reconsider expanding in or relocating to the Bay Area and California real-estate and relocation specialists said .
Few specialists said they expect the quake to have much of an effect on most California property values .
But real-estate experts and brokers said the quake undoubtedly will drag down prices in neighborhoods built on less stable ground especially in the Bay Area .
California prices were already coming down .
This is n't going to help said Kenneth T. Rosen chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley .
State housing prices at a median 201,028 have declined in recent months because of potential buyers ' inability to afford homes .
Mr. Rosen among others suggested that the quake the strongest since the 1906 temblor that struck San Francisco will in the short term create a two-tier price system for quake-prone communities with dwellings built on sturdy ground likely to demand higher prices .
One San Francisco neighborhood likely to test Mr. Rosen 's theory soon is the city 's fashionable Marina district which boasts some of the highest home prices in the state .
The district built on landfill suffered heavy quake damage including collapsed buildings .
Yesterday the city demolished two dwellings in the district because of severe structural damage and said as many as 19 of the district 's 350 dwellings might have to be razed .
Brokers agreed with the two-tier price theory .
My gut feeling is that the Marina properties will be affected said Grace Perkins senior vice president at Grubb & Ellis Residential Brokerage Inc .
Neither she nor other real-estate executives and brokers could project how much less Marina properties might bring but she said the two-tier price structure would affect prices for a while .
Mr. Rosen said the quake will revive consumer interest in a little-publicized 1972 state law that requires brokers to disclose to potential buyers how close a property sits to a fault line .
Because of the size of the California market few relocation specialists expect a widespread corporate flight in the quake 's aftermath .
But they said the quake will force some companies to relocate or expand part or all of their operations outside the state .
What you 're going to get is We do n't want to put all of our eggs in one basket ' theory said James H. Renzas president of Location Management Services Inc. a Palo Alto Calif. relocation concern .
Mr. Renzas among others said the quake will prod companies in certain industries like semiconductors computers and aerospace to consider moving operations that involve particularly sensitive machinery to locations outside California .
Because of the quake threat some firms have evaluated what the cost is to shore up their buildings and compared it with the cost of building it elswehere he said .
One Southern California aerospace firm for example two months ago asked Location Management to compare the costs of reinforcing its current building against earthquakes with the cost of building a new structure elsewhere .
A new dwelling would cost 21 million Location Management found compared with 22 million to make the present building earthquake-proof .
The company Mr. Renzas said has n't yet determined what to do .
NATIONWIDE HEALTH PROPERTIES Pasadena Calif. said it would n't pay its fourth-quarter dividend despite a 44 % increase in third-quarter earnings to 3.5 million or 42 cents a share .
Net income included a gain of 708,000 on asset sales the real estate investment trust said .
A year earlier Nationwide Health earned 2.4 million or 29 cents a share .
Revenue rose 3 % to 9 million from 8.8 million .
Nationwide Health said that although it has the cash to cover the 25-cent-a-share dividend its banks have denied the company 's request to pay it because the trust has n't met certain terms .
Nationwide Health said it has numerous financing activities under way to remedy the problem and will make up the dividend payment later if possible .
Aussedat Rey S.A. a French paper producer said it concluded an agreement with Japan 's Fuji Photo Film Co. that will allow Aussedat Rey to manufacture and sell thermal paper using Fuji technology .

W.R. Grace & Co. New York said its earnings for the third quarter nearly doubled as a result of a 114.4 million pre-tax gain from restructuring its energy operations and other adjustments .
Net income rose to 97.9 million or 1.15 a share from 50.5 million or 60 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales increased 7 % to 1.49 billion from 1.39 billion .
The gain resulted from the sale of Grace Equipment Co. the initial public offering of a one-sixth interest in Grace Energy Corp. and an adjustment in the carrying value of certain natural resource assets not part of Grace Energy .
The international specialty chemical company 's earnings were hurt by an accrual for stock-appreciation rights that reflected a 19 % increase in the stock price and higher interest expenses .
Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. said the third-quarter combined profit of its six gold mines dropped 8.5 % from the previous quarter .

Doman Industries Ltd. said it increased its stake in Western Forest Products Ltd. to 56 % from 22 % through a two-step transaction valued at 137 million Canadian dollars US116.7 million .
Doman is based in Duncan British Columbia .
The company founded and controlled by Harbanse Doman its chairman and president said the purchase would make it Canada 's 10th largest forest products company .
Under terms of the transaction which was proposed in June Doman said it acquired International Forest Products Ltd. 's 22 % stake in Western Forest and Western Forest in a related transaction bought back a 22 % interest in the company from Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd .
The Fletcher Challenge Canada stake was then canceled Doman said raising Doman 's interest in Western Forest to 56 % .
Doman said it was also granted an option to acquire the remaining 44 % interest in Western Forest which is currently held by two Canadian banks .
International Forest Western Forest and Fletcher Challenge Canada are Vancouver-based forest products concerns .
The Canadian government introduced in the House of Commons legislation to extend federal regulatory authority over provincial government-owned telephone utilities in Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba .
The legislation would open the way for more telephone services and more competition in the telephone business in the three provinces federal officials said .
The federal government initiative follows a recent Canadian Supreme Court decision that held that the major telephone companies in Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba and in the Atlantic coast provinces were interprovincial undertakings and subject to federal legislative authority .
Prior to the ruling the federal government had regulated only the telephone companies in Quebec Ontario British Columbia and the Northwest Territories .
The governments of Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba have strongly opposed federal regulation of their telephone companies .
The extension of federal regulatory authority over telephone utilities in the Atlantic provinces has n't required special legislation because they are investor-owned .
Amdura Corp. said its bank group led by Chicago-based Continental Bank agreed to extend its 40 million bridge loan until March 31 1990 and gave it a new 30 million credit line .
Under terms of the loan agreement Amdura said it will omit the next quarterly dividends on its Series A B C and D preferred shares which are due Nov. 15 .
Since the preferred stock is cumulative Amdura said it will pay all omitted dividends which range from 1.19 to 4.88 a share when debt-reduction requirements have been met .
Amdura 's bridge loan part of the financing for Amdura 's acquisition of CoastAmerica in December 1988 was to come due next Friday .
The company 's new management which took control of Amdura 's board after a consent solicitation last month wanted to extend the loan while it tries to sell two units .
Proceeds from those sales will be used to reduce debt .
Amdura a Denver hardware and automotive distributor said the new credit agreement will provide the working capital needed to meet ongoing requirements .

International Business Machines Corp. and MCA Inc. said they agreed to sell their Discovision Associates joint venture to U.S. units of Pioneer Electronic Corp. for 200 million .
The joint venture licenses a portfolio of about 1,400 patents and patent applications relating to optical-disk recording technology .
IBM and MCA formed Discovision in 1979 to make laser-read optical products .
But the partners did n't believe the market for the systems was developing as rapidly as they had hoped .
After reportedly investing 100 million in the business Discovision ceased manufacturing operations in 1982 and sold many of its assets to Tokyo-based Pioneer among others .
Discovision now has world-wide license agreements with major manufacturers covering CD audio disks audio disk players videodisks and videodisk players .
It also licenses optically based data storage and retrieval devices .
James N. Fiedler president of Discovision and a vice president of MCA said that IBM and MCA had n't planned to sell the joint venture which is now profitable but that Pioneer approached Discovision earlier this year .

The agreement is contingent on certain government approvals and should be completed later this year .

The morning session was dominated by individuals and dealers but some institutions participated in the afternoon encouraged by the market 's firmness traders said .
Sentiment was helped by the small gain made by New York stocks Wednesday despite anxiety over possible effects of the major earthquake that struck northern California Tuesday .
Having survived both last Friday 's 6.9 % Wall Street plunge and the immediate aftermath of the San Francisco Bay area earthquake Tokyo market participants expressed relief that trading had returned to normal .
Hiroyuki Murai general manager of the stock trading division at Nikko Securities said that after looking at the reasons for Friday 's Wall Street plunge participants realized that the Tokyo and New York markets have different economic fundamentals .
This conclusion he said restored the credibility of Tokyo stocks .
Yoshiaki Mitsuoka head of the investment information department at Daiwa Investment Trust & Management said that if New York stocks just fluctuate in or near their current range the Tokyo market will remain firm with a moderately upward trend for the rest of the year .
But traders said the market lacks a base on which to set long-term buying strategy as the future direction of U.S. interest rates remains unclear .

The federal response to California 's earthquake crisis was marred by coast-to-coast name-calling between the White House and San Francisco 's Mayor Art Agnos .
Mr. Agnos complained that he was ticked off that Vice President Dan Quayle who toured the earthquake site Wednesday did n't schedule a private meeting with him .
The mayor said the Quayle visit was a publicity stunt .
The White House said Mr. Quayle 's staff had invited the mayor to two meetings of the vice president and groups of local officials and had offered to dispatch a helicopter to pick him up .

Gold and silver broker Preston Semel asked a federal court to halt the Commodity Exchange from imposing a record 550,000 fine on his firm .
The suit filed in federal court in Manhattan also asks that the Comex 's nine-month suspension of Mr. Semel be lifted pending the broker 's appeal of the disciplinary measures .
The fine and suspension announced in August are the stiffest sanctions the Comex has ever ordered against one of its members .
The Comex accused the 39-year-old Mr. Semel of fraudulent conduct and improper trading .
The disciplinary proceedings stem from trading in April 1987 .
Mr. Semel and his firm Semel & Co. have appealed the Comex decision and the sanctions to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .

Already the firm has paid 211,666 of the fine the suit said and it will have to liquidate additional assets in order to pay the rest .
