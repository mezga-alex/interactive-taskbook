Dennis Dalton of Ventura Calif. thinks mergers often trigger longer lunch hours and increased absenteeism conduct which can sap the bottom line more than thefts .
New management can take several steps to reduce dishonesty .
Most important experts say is to show that a company 's ethical tone is set at the top .
Mr. Dalton also recommends that the chief executive establish a rumor control center and move swiftly to bolster morale .
Consultant John Keller of Southlake Texas urges that top management adopt a tough hands-on approach with very tight controls and monitoring .
And security authority Robert L. Duston favors disciplining all employees who cheat .
Firms Walk Fine Line In Distributing Profits ARE CORPORATE profits distributed fairly .
A survey by Sirota Alper & Pfau a New York consulting firm underscores the difficulty for top management in satisfying employees and investors on that score .
Nearly seven of 10 investors think companies reinvest too little of their profits in the business .
And half the employees surveyed think companies dole out too little to them .
But both see a common enemy About 66 % of employees and 73 % of investors think senior managers get too big a slice of the profit pie .
Bank of New York Co. said it agreed in principle to acquire the credit-card business of Houston-based First City Bancorp. of Texas for between 130 million and 134 million .
The move subject to a definitive agreement is part of a trend by big-city banks that have been buying up credit-card portfolios to expand their business .
Just last month a Bank of New York subsidiary agreed to buy the credit-card operation of Dreyfus Corp. 's Dreyfus Consumer Bank for 168 million a transaction that is expected to be completed by the end of the year .
First City 's portfolio includes approximately 640,000 accounts with about 550 million in loans outstanding .
First City which issues both MasterCard and Visa cards has agreed to act as an agent bank .
At the end of the third quarter Bank of New York 's credit-card business consisted of 2.4 million accounts with 3.6 billion in loans outstanding .
Bank of New York is currently the seventh-largest issuer of credit cards in the First City said that because of increased competition in the credit-card business it had decided it either had to expand its own holdings substantially or sell them .
We think there 's a good prospect that competition is going to get pretty fierce in this market said James E. Day a First City vice president .
We see it becoming a bargain-basement kind of business .
The company estimated that the transaction would enhance its book value which stood at 28.55 a share on Sept. 30 by more than 100 million or about 4 a share .
The company also said the transaction would bolster after-tax earnings by 3.25 a share when completed and boost its primary capital ratio to 7 % from 6.63 % .
First City which recently purchased three small Texas banking concerns said it would use the proceeds to pursue additional expansion opportunities in the Southwest and elsewhere .
With that possibility in mind analysts said the transaction was a positive move for First City .
I think they 'll be able to move faster to make acquisitions in Texas said Brent Erensel an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette .
That 's something they can do very well .
British Airways PLC said it is seeking improved terms and a sharply lower price in any revised bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. following the collapse of a 6.79 billion 300-a-share buy-out bid .
Derek Stevens British Air 's chief financial officer told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report a price of 230 a share is certainly not too low and indicated his company would like to reduce the size of its 750 million cash investment .
He added the airline is n't committed to going forward with any new bid and has n't participated in bankers ' efforts to revive the transaction that collapsed .
We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all .
We 're not rushing into anything .
We do n't want to be party to a second rejection he said adding that coming up with a revised offer could easily take several weeks .
Mr. Stevens 's remarks confirming a report in The Wall Street Journal that British Air wants to start from scratch in any new bid for the nation 's second-largest airline helped push UAL stock lower for the fourth straight day .
UAL fell 6.25 a share to 191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase .
Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 UAL 's pilots planned to put up 200 million in cash and make 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake .
UAL management was to pay 15 million for 10 % and British Air was to receive a 15 % stake .
The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing .
Since then UAL stock has fallen 33 % in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever .
The tenor of Mr. Stevens 's remarks seemed to indicate that British Air will take a more active high-profile role in pursuing any new bid .
He said he believes UAL management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction .
Mr. Stevens said British Air has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group led by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and has n't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming .
As far as we 're concerned we 're waiting for the dust to settle he said .
Although British Air is waiting to see what the buy-out group comes up with Mr. Stevens said a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks .
He said the original proposal is dead and all aspects of a revised version are up for change in light of the changes in UAL 's market price the amount of debt banks are willing to fund and the price British Air would be willing to pay .
Mr. Stevens said he expects the new price will be considerably lower but declined to specify a figure .
Asked whether a 230-a-share figure circulating in the market yesterday is too low he said It 's certainly not too low .
He added the original offer was a pretty full price and that British Air 's contribution was quite a large chunk for us .
British Air was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a 15 % stake in the company but was n't particularly happy with paying 750 million .
If the new deal had us putting up less money but still having 15 % that would be a point in our favor he said .
In any new proposal British Air would expect a greater rate of return than the 20%-plus in the original proposal .
In the event that the buy-out group stalls in reviving its bid the UAL board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction even without any legal obligation to do so .
Roughly one-third of its stock is believed held by takeover stock traders who could vote to oust the board if they become impatient .
Meanwhile the buy-out group 's task of holding its fragile coalition together in the face of the bid 's collapse and internal opposition from two other employee groups has been further complicated by an apparent rift in the ranks of the pilot union itself .
A pilot representing a group of 220 pilots hired during United 's 1985 strike filed suit Friday in Chicago federal court to block the takeover .
The dissident pilots oppose the plan because it would cause them to lose their seniority .
UAL 's management agreed to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the United pilot union for the buy-out proposal .
The 220 pilots involved in the suit are n't members of the union .
The airline had allowed them to move ahead of some union members in seniority following the 1985 strike a move the union had contested in a previous lawsuit .

Corporate efforts to control health-care costs by requiring evaluations prior to planned hospitalization and surgery have n't been sweeping enough to reduce the long-term rate of cost increases according to a study by the Institute of Medicine .
In the last decade many corporations have embraced the utilization management cost containment strategy as a way to control health-care costs for employees .
These programs vary widely but often require second opinions on proposed surgery preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods .
Between 50 % and 75 % of today 's workers are covered by such plans up from 5 % five years ago .
Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers utilization management like most other cost containment strategies does n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs the Institute of Medicine an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences concluded after a two-year study .
Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends .
While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs according to the report by a panel of health-care experts .
The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow .
The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital and not the actual need for a particular procedure has been the main focus the panel said .
As a general rule prior-review programs have not made case-by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care .
The report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines .
Howard Bailit a panel member and a vice president of Aetna Life & Casualty said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals .
There 's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization he said .
But at the same time spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed .
It 's like squeezing a balloon Dr. Bailit said .
David Rahill of A. Foster Higgins & Co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about 5 % but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs .
Jerome Grossman chairman of the panel agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high .
You have a whole staff standing ready to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment he said .
Dr. Grossman who also is president of New England Medical Center Hospitals in Boston noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than 100 utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements .
The panel urged greater efforts to reduce the complexity paperwork and cost of utilization review .
Utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and providers the panel concluded .
Renault and DAF Trucks NV announced a preliminary agreement to jointly manufacture a line of trucks in Britain and France .
Philippe Gras a Renault managing director said the new line will cover trucks of between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons and will be built at Renault 's Bapilly plant in France and at DAF 's British plant .
The French state-controlled auto group and the Dutch truck maker plan to incorporate the new trucks into their product lines when they begin production toward the middle of the 1990s .
Mr. Gras said he expects a definitive agreement between the two companies to be completed in the next few months .
The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in Europe ahead of the 1992 deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the European Community .
Renault and DAF are expected to invest a total of about three billion French francs 157.8 million in the venture including FFr 1 billion for design and development costs .
In addition the companies will each spend about FFr 1 billion on tooling up their plants .
Mr. Gras said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles .
By pooling their resources the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed he said .
Renault officials said the potential European market for light trucks in the 2.5-ton to 4.2-ton range is between 700,000 and 800,000 vehicles annually and Renault and DAF are aiming for a combined market share of about 11 % .
Both Renault and DAF will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks .
Under a separate arrangement British Aerospace PLC 's Rover Group PLC subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the U.K. and Renault 's truck-building subsidiary Renault Vehicles Industriels will have similar rights in France .
DAF is 16%-owned by British Aerospace with a further 6.5 % held by the Dutch state-owned chemical group NV DSM .
The van Doorne family of the Netherlands holds an additional 11 % of DAF 's capital .
The Federal Reserve System is the standard object of suggestions for organizational and institutional changes for two reasons .
First its position in the government is anomalous .
It has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government 's instruments the control of the money supply .
Thus we have a condition that is easily described as undemocratic .
Second the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as guardian of the currency which means as guardian of the stability of the price level sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular .
As former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin used to say they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting .
So the Federal Reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians .
The Fed is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness like high interest rates or slow economic growth while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the Fed 's independence .
This leads to proposals for reform of the Fed which have the common feature of making the Fed more responsive to the administration to the Congress and to public opinion without however any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians .
These proposals include changing the term of the chairman shortening the terms of the members eliminating the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks from the decision-making process putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Federal Reserve Board having the Fed audited by an arm of Congress the General Accounting Office putting the Fed 's expenditures in the budget and requiring prompt publication of the Fed 's minutes .
Some of these ideas are again under consideration in Congress .
But these proposals do not rest on a view of what the Fed 's problem is or if they do they rest on an incorrect view .
They would not solve the problem they would make it worse .
The problem is not that the Fed is too unresponsive to the public interest .
On the contrary it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest .
The price level in the U.S. is now about 4 1\/4 times as high as it was 30 years ago .
On average something that cost 100 30 years ago now costs 425 .
Or a wage that was 100 30 years ago would buy only 23.53 worth of stuff today .
On two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than 10 % a year .
In each case the ending of this unsustainable inflation caused a severe recession the two worst of the postwar period .
The enormous inflation over the past 30 years was largely due to monetary policy .
At least it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period .
And that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the Federal Reserve .
The basic problem of monetary policy to which reform of the Fed should be addressed is to prevent a recurrence of this experience .
There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years 1 .
To some extent the Federal Reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output .
2 .
Even where the Fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it .
Despite all the formal provisions for its independence the Fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it .
The common proposals for reforming the Fed would only make the situation worse if they had any effect at all .
Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors one of the leading proposals today is an example .
The secretary is the world 's biggest borrower of money .
He has a built-in constant longing for lower interest rates .
Moreover he is a political agent of a political president who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election and less to its longer-run health .
These days the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be which is a diversion from the real business of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the price level .
How should a reasonable member of the Federal Reserve Board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board .
Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the Fed to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level .
Or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents low interest rates short-run economic expansion and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels .
The answer seems perfectly clear .
True a succession of Fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the Secretary of the Treasury belongs on the Fed .
By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew in which case it is natural that the Fed and the Treasury and probably also the Congress should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot .
The Fed 's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the government .
The Fed 's problem is not that it is too independent or too unpolitical .
The Fed is responsive to and can not help being responsive to the more overtly political part of the government .
The Fed exercises a power given to it by Congress and the president .
But Congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the Fed .
Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic .
What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level .
To leave this decision to an independent agency is not only undemocratic .
It also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale because it leaves the Fed guessing about what are the expectations of its masters the politicians who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy .
The greatest contribution Congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System .
Legislation to this effect has been introduced in Congress in this session by Rep. Stephen Neal D. N.C .
.
It is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted however .
Congress would be required to make a hard decision and Congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact .
People will say that the nation and the government have other objectives in addition to stabilizing the price level which is true .
But that is not the same as saying that the Federal Reserve has other objectives .
The government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives .
But it has only the Fed to pursue price-level stability .
And the Fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level .
The two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the Fed are high employment and rapid real growth .
But the main lesson of economic policy in the past 30 years is that if the Fed compromises with the price-stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation .

Republic New York Corp. joined the list of banks boosting reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries setting out a 200 million provision and posting a 155.4 million third-quarter net loss as a result .
The per-share loss was 5.32 .
In the year earlier period the New York parent of Republic National Bank had net income of 38.7 million or 1.12 a share .
Excluding the provision Republic earned 44.6 million up 15 % from a year ago .
The bank 's medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries total 293 million of which 146 million are n't accruing interest the bank said .
Republic 's total of nonperforming assets was 167 million at Sept. 30 with its reserve for loan losses now standing at 357 million .
Abortion-rights advocates won last week 's battles but the war over the nation 's most-contentious social question is about to pick up again on turf that favors those seeking to restrict abortions .
Strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state House in Pennsylvania next week with easy approval by the Senate and by Democratic Gov. Bob Casey expected shortly thereafter .
Legislation to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of 18 can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the Michigan legislature and set up a grinding battle to override the expected veto of Democratic Gov. James Blanchard .
The short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the debate in the next several months the reawakening of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude and the ability of each side to counter the other 's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere .
The action in Pennsylvania for example will follow last week 's collapse of a special session of the Florida legislature to enact restrictions on abortions in that state and the vote here in Washington by the House to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest .
But President Bush is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that along with the easy approval of the Pennsylvania measure is likely to mute the abortion-rights activists ' claims of momentum and underline the challenges faced by this resurgent movement .
It 's great to feel good for once in 15 years says Harrison Hickman a consultant to abortion-rights advocates reflecting the relief of his compatriots after last week 's victories the first major events since the Supreme Court in its July 3 Webster decision permitted the states to enact restrictions on abortions .
But how many more times we 're going to feel good in the next 15 is another question .
Indeed abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests .
The pro-choice movement has shown finally that it can mobilize says Glen Halva-Neubauer a Furman University political scientist who specializes in how state legislators handle the abortion question .
But it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time .
The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the viewpoints of the state 's citizens .
As a result GOP state Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County the legislature 's leading foe of abortion has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and he hopes to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place .
The Freind legislation the state 's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy except to avert the death of the mother .
Mr. Freind calculates that the provision which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established will make it necessary for the Supreme Court to review Roe and perhaps to overturn it .
But the Pennsylvania measure also includes an informed consent provision that may become widely imitated by abortion foes who want to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves .
Under this legislation a woman must be informed 24 hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks .
Regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion Mr. Freind argues it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which one way or the other might remain with her for the rest of her life .
In Michigan where the state Senate is expected to approve parental-consent legislation by the end of next week Gov. Blanchard is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists .
Susan Rogin a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state takes comfort from the fact that the state 's House abortion opponents have n't been able to muster the votes to overturn a veto on abortion in 16 years .
But proponents believe they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents ' rights .
In Illinois lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on fetuses at 20 weeks to determine their gestational age weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that if fetuses survive an abortion a second doctor must be on hand to help it survive .
The legislation failed by one vote to clear the House Rules Committee Tuesday but anti-abortionists still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this fall .
Pamela Sutherland executive director of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council says she and her allies are cautiously optimistic they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote .
Abortion foes in Wisconsin meanwhile expect a parental-consent bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early November and are hopeful of prevailing in both houses by next March .
In Texas abortion opponents want to pass parental-consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds personnel and facilities for abortion and viability tests for fetuses 19 weeks and older .
The anti-abortionists are urging GOP Gov. Bill Clements to press the issues in a special session scheduled to run Nov. 14 to Dec. 13 .
The prognosis is only fair says Kathie Roberts administrative director of the Texas Right to Life Committee .
Next year is an election year and the legislators just do n't want to do anything about this now .
This legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new mobilization efforts plunging into gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey and girding for next autumn 's state elections .
At the same time abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy deciding to move on what Jacki Ragan the National Right to Life Committee 's director of state organizational development calls reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of Americans support .
These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection and the public funding of alternatives for abortion .
Those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves pro-choice rather than pro-abortion says Mary Spaulding the group 's associate state legislative coordinator .
Over the weekend the National Abortion Rights Action League singled out eight politicians including Pennsylvania 's Mr. Freind as 1990 targets and held a Washington seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures .
We now see pro-choice legislators going on the offensive for the first time says Kate Michelman executive director of the group .

In a separate development a private meeting is scheduled this morning between House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten D. Miss .
and Sen. Dale Bumpers D. Ark .
in an effort to end a dispute which for two weeks has delayed action on an estimated 44 billion agriculture bill .
A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides .
The program 's nonprofit sponsors received 900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990 .

B.A.T Industries PLC may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan including the sale of its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field units in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets company officials said .
The British conglomerate planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a 13.35 billion 21.03 billion takeover bid by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value-boosting measures .
If anything the gyrations in world stock markets and in B.A.T 's share price since last Friday 's sharp Wall Street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring analysts and several big institutional holders said .
Thank God we have some deal on the table said Stewart Gilchrist a director at Scottish Amicable Investment Managers which intends to vote its roughly 1 % stake in favor of the restructuring .
Investors in B.A.T have been on a roller coaster .
B.A.T has been London 's best-performing blue chip over the past six months up 40 % against a 4 % rise in the Financial Times 100-Share Index .
But this week B.A.T has been hit harder than other big U.K. stocks first by the market gyrations then by Tuesday 's San Francisco earthquake which could leave B.A.T 's Farmers Group Inc. insurance unit facing big claims .
B.A.T rose five pence eight cents to 756 pence 11.91 in London yesterday as a late market rally erased a 28-pence fall earlier in the day .
To fight off predators B.A.T plans to spin off about 6 billion in assets largely by selling such U.S. retailing units as Marshall Field and Saks and by floating its big paper and U.K. retailing business via share issues to existing holders .
Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10 % of its shares and a 50 % dividend increase .
I think the restructuring will get the required support said Michael Pacitti an analyst at London stockbroker UBS Phillips & Drew .
The shareholders effectively will support the share price by clearing the share buy-back .
But B.A.T 's restructuring which was never going to happen quickly now will take longer because of the market upheaval .
Company officials holders and analysts who previously expected the disposals to be substantially complete by the end of next year 's first half now say the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second half .
We are n't forced sellers .
We do n't have an absolute deadline and if market conditions are truly awful we might decide it is not the right time to take particular steps said Michael Prideaux a B.A.T spokesman .
Even if B.A.T receives approval for the restructuring the company will remain in play say shareholders and analysts though the situation may unfold over the next 12 months rather than six .
The new B.A.T will be a smaller tobacco and financial-services hybrid whose price-earnings ratio may more closely reflect the lower-growth tobacco business than the higher-multiple financial-services business these holders believe .
Thus B.A.T 's restructuring may only make the company a more manageable target for other corporate predators possibly such acquisitive bidders as Hanson PLC .
The last few days will surely slow down the pace of events says Scottish Amicable 's Mr. Gilchrist .
But I would n't write off Sir James or other potential bidders .
Among possible delays the sales of Saks and Marshall Field which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial Christmas season may slide into the second quarter or second half .
Analysts estimate that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly 2 billion .
B.A.T is n't predicting a postponement because the units are quality businesses and we are encouraged by the breadth of inquiries said Mr. Prideaux .
But the delay could happen if B.A.T does n't get adequate bids he said .
People familiar with B.A.T say possible acquirers for the units include managers from both retailing chains and General Cinema Corp. which is interested in bidding for Saks .
Other potential bidders for parts of B.A.T 's U.S. retail unit include Dillard Department Stores Inc. May Department Stores Co. and Limited Inc .
B.A.T has declined to identify the potential bidders .
Though Sir James has said he intends to mount a new bid for B.A.T once approval from U.S. insurance regulators is received jitters over prospects for junk-bond financing and U.S. leverage buy-outs are making investors more skeptical about Sir James 's prospects .
His initial offer indicated he needed to raise as much as 80 % of the takeover financing through the debt markets .
Market uncertainty also clouds the outlook for B.A.T 's attracting a premium price for its U.S. retailing properties .
Finally Tuesday 's California earthquake initially knocked 3.7 % off B.A.T 's share price in London yesterday because of fears of the potential claims to Los Angeles-based Farmers which has a substantial portion of its property and casualty exposure in California .
On Farmers Mr. Prideaux said it is too early to quantify the level of potential claims .
He added B.A.T has no expectation of a material impact on Farmers .
Bridge and highway collapses will disrupt truck and auto transportation in the San Francisco Bay area for months to come .
But rail air and ocean-shipping links to the area escaped Tuesday 's earthquake with only minor damage and many are expected to be operating normally today government and corporate transport officials said .
Air traffic at San Francisco International Airport was running about 50 % of normal yesterday afternoon but airport officals said they expect a return to full operations by Saturday .
The major gateway to Asia and one of the nation 's 10 busiest airports was closed to all but emergency traffic from the time the quake hit Tuesday afternoon until 6 a.m. PDT yesterday when controllers returned to the tower .
Getting to and from the airport in coming weeks may be the problem however .
People 's ability to drive throughout the bay area is greatly restricted said a spokesman for the American Automobile Association .
Tom Schumacher executive vice president and general manager of the California Trucking Association in Sacremento said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the Bay area yesterday except for emergency-medical supplies .
Some foodstuff shipments will probably resume Thursday he said .
Right now most of the roads into the Bay area are closed but the list of closings changes about every 20 minutes .
This Wednesday morning the San Mateo bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed Mr. Schumacher said .
United Parcel Service Greenwich Conn. said its operations in the San Francisco area have been reduced to 40 % of normal .
A UPS spokesman said that although none of the company 's terminals trucks or airplanes were damaged in the quake road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages .
The spokesman noted four-hour to five-hour traffic delays on the San Mateo bridge for example .
In addition power failures prevented its package-sorting facilities from operating causing delays .
But freight railroads reported that damage to their facilities was relatively minor with Santa Fe Pacific Corp. 's rail unit the least affected by the quake .
Santa Fe stopped freight trains Tuesday night while its officials inspected track but resumed service at 10:45 p.m. when they found no damage .
Union Pacific Corp. 's rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its Oakland yard its track bridges and structures were unharmed .
That railroad is operating trains but with delays caused by employees unable to get to work .
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. the hardest hit of the three railroads in the Bay area said service on its north-south coastline which is used by an Amtrak train between Los Angeles and Seattle was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake .
But service on the line is expected to resume by noon today .
We had no serious damage on the railroad said a Southern Pacific spokesman .
We have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down .
Amtrak said it suspended train service into its Oakland station which sustained heavy structural damage during the quake .
The passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in Sacramento relying on buses to ferry passengers to the Bay area .
Amtrak said it planned to resume some train operations to Oakland late yesterday .
Rail-transit operations suffered little damage according to Albert Engelken deputy executive director of the American Public Transit Association in Washington .
The Bay Area Rapid Transit withstood the earthquake perfectly said Mr. Engelken adding that the rail system was running a full fleet of 45 trains during the day to provide an alternative for highway travelers .
The highway system is screwed up by the earthquake Mr. Engelken said .
The transit system is how people are going to be getting around .
He added that San Francisco 's trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels .
Although air-traffic delays in San Francisco were significant yesterday they did n't appear to spread to other airports .
The earthquake shattered windows at San Francisco International 's air-traffic control tower and rained pieces of the ceiling down on controllers three of whom suffered minor injuries .
Terminals at San Francisco International also were damaged but the tower itself was intact .
Tuesday night thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel .
Runways at San Francisco were n't damaged but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour down from 33 to 45 an hour normally mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows an FAA spokeswoman said .
While the airport was closed flights were diverted to airports in Sacramento and Stockton Calif. Reno and Las Vegas Nev. and Los Angeles .
United Airlines the largest carrier at San Francisco was operating only 50 % of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area .
A United spokesman said 14 of its 21 gates were unusable mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors .
The United spokesman said none of its people were injured at the airport in fact as the airport was being evacuated Tuesday night two babies were born .
Yesterday the United ticket counter was active with people trying to get flights out but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active with people trying to get there to help family and friends .
The airports in San Jose and Oakland were both fully operational by noon yesterday the Federal Aviation Administration said .
In terms of diversions Denver 's Stapleton International may have experienced the most far-flung A United flight from Japan was rerouted there .
I think that 's the first nonstop commercial passenger flight from Japan to land here an airport spokesman said .
A Japan Air Lines spokesman said its flights into and out of San Francisco were n't affected but getting information about its operations was difficult .
Its telecommunications headquarters in Burlingame Calif. had been knocked out since the quake .
We 're in the dark he said .
Whitbread & Co. put its spirits division up for sale triggering a scramble among global groups for the British company 's brands .
Whitbread already has been approached by about half a dozen companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business a spokesman said .
Analysts expect the spirits operations and some California vineyards that also are being sold to fetch about 500 million 788.8 million .
Among the brands for sale are Beefeater gin the No. 2 imported gin in the U.S. and Laphroaig single-malt whiskey .
Also for sale are Buckingham Wile Co. which distributes Cutty Sark blended whiskey in the U.S. and Whitbread 's Atlas Peak Vineyards in California 's Napa Valley .
Beefeater alone is worth as much as 300 million analysts said .
Whitbread bought the Beefeater distillery two years ago for 174.5 million .
That purchase represented an attempt by Whitbread a venerable British brewer to become a major player in the global liquor business .
But Whitbread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry .
Now it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations .
For rival liquor companies the Whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands .
It 's not very often something like this comes up said Ron Littleboy a liquor company analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London .
The division will be sold off quite rapidly predicted Neill Junor an analyst at London brokers County NatWest WoodMac .
Among possible buyers Grand Metropolitan PLC might find Beefeater a useful addition to its portfolio .
Grand Met owns Bombay gin the No. 3 imported gin in the U.S. rival Guinness PLC has the No. 1 imported brand Tanqueray .
The Whitbread spirits auction is an extremely interesting development and naturally we 'll be considering it carefully a Grand Met spokesman said .
Guinness which owns several leading whiskey brands plus Gordon 's gin the world 's No. 1 gin is considered less likely to bid for the Whitbread spirits .
A Guinness spokesman declined to comment .
Two other global liquor giants Canada 's Seagram Co. and Britain 's Allied-Lyons PLC also are possible buyers .
Seagram 's gin is the world 's No. 2 gin brand but the company does n't own any of the major gin brands imported in the U.S. .
Allied-Lyons while powerful in whiskey does n't own any major white-spirit brands .
We will certainly have to take a look at the Whitbread spirits business an Allied-Lyons spokesman said .
We would certainly like to have a major white-spirits brand in our portfolio .
A Seagram spokesman in New York would n't comment .
Smaller liquor companies such as Brown-Forman Corp. and American Brands Inc. of the U.S. also are likely to be interested .
Such companies are increasingly being left behind in the global liquor business says Nomura 's Mr. Littleboy .
In New York a spokesman for American Brands would n't comment .
Brown-Forman a Louisville Ky. distiller also declined to comment .
Whitbread 's wine spirits and soft-drink operations had trading profit of 35.4 million on sales of 315.5 million in the year ended Feb. 25 .
The company which is retaining most of its wine and all of its soft-drink interests did n't break out results for the businesses it plans to sell .
But analysts estimate their trading profit at 30 million .
Whitbread had total pretax profit in the year ended Feb. 25 of 223.2 million on sales of 2.26 billion .
Whitbread 's spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the British beer industry .
Earlier this year the government annou
