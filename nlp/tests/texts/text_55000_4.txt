The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment that President Bush sought to protect the U.S. flag from desecration .
The 51-48 roll call fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve changes to the Constitution .
The vote in which 11 GOP lawmakers voted against Mr. Bush 's position was a victory for Democratic leaders who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights .
We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine .
In order to defuse pressure for an amendment Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley D. Wash .
had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change .
Mr. Bush said he would allow the bill to become law without his signature because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately .
In June the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration saying he was engaging in political expression that is protected by the First Amendment .
If you think you have stress-related problems on the job there 's good news and bad news .
You 're probably right and you are n't alone .
A new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness with about 13 % suffering from depression .
The study surveyed a national group of medical directors personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies .
It is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the New York Business Group a non-profit organization with about 300 members .
The stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress are much more prevalent than they seem said Leon J. Warshaw executive director of the business group .
In presenting the study late last week Dr. Warshaw estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial .
Occupational disability related to anxiety depression and stress costs about 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation .
In terms of days lost on the job the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress anxiety or depression .
He added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims .
We hope to sensitize employers to recognize the problems so they can do something about them Dr. Warshaw said .
Early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with hospitalization which sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too long .
Even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance .
But although 56 % of the respondents in the study indicated that mental-health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace there is still a social stigma associated with people seeking help .
The disorders which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people now strike people at the height of productivity says Robert M.A. Hirschfeld of the National Institute of Mental Health who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings .
The poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem with 65 % of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying stress-related problems were fairly pervasive and 55 % of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing .
The poll also noted fear of a takeover as a stress-producing event in larger companies .
More than eight in 10 respondents reported such a stress-provoking situation in their company .
Mid-sized companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings .
The study which received funding from Upjohn Co. which makes several drugs to treat stress-related illnesses also found 47 % of the managers said stress anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production .
Alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30 % of those polled .
Although Dr. Warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout .
He also noted that various work environments such as night work have their own stressors .
We all like stress but there 's a limit says Paul D'Arcy of Rohrer Hibler & Replogle a corporate psychology and management consulting firm .
The problem says Mr. D'Arcy a psychologist is that it 's very hard to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance .
For Cheap Air Fares Spend Christmas Aloft IT IS N'T TRUE that a 90-year old clergyman on a mission of mercy to a disaster area on Christmas Day can fly free .
But his circumstances are among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in America .
In recent years carriers have become much more picky about who can fly on the cheap .
But there still are a few ways today 's traveler can qualify under the airline 's many restrictions .
One of the best deals though may mean skipping Christmas dinner with the relatives .
This week many carriers are announcing cut-rate fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed and slowest days of the year including Christmas .
In recent years the airlines had waited until the last moment to court Christmas season vacationers with bargain fares .
That approach flopped Last Christmas Day a USAir Group Inc. DC-9 jetliner flew about seven passengers from Chicago to Pittsburgh .
So this year the airlines are getting a jump on holiday discounts .
They are cutting ticket prices by as much as 70 % from normal levels for travel to most U.S. locations on Dec. 24 25 29 30 and 31 and Jan. 4 5 and 6 .
The promotions dubbed everything from 'T- is the Season to be Jolly to Kringle fares put round-trip fares at 98 148 and 198 .
They 're trying to keep planes flying on days they 'd normally park them says Roger Bard president of Mr. Mitchell Travel Service in Burnsville N.C .
Expect of course sky-high prices on other dates near the holidays when the airlines know vacationers are eager to travel .
Consider Adopting Your Spouse 's Name IF CONTINENTAL Airlines has its way couples like Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue may find it a hassle to qualify for some new discounts .
Continental a Texas Air Corp. unit recently unveiled a marketing program offering free companion tickets to business-class and first-class passengers on international flights .
The Continental catch Only immediate family members are allowed and they must have the same last name as the buyer of the ticket or legal proof they 're related .
That irritates many women who have n't taken their husbands ' last name .
What a bunch of nonsense says Jessica Crosby president of the New York chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners .
This sets things way back .
Continental 's logic It does n't want business companions abusing the promotion by falsely claiming to be related .
We accommodate their choice of names by allowing them to demonstrate family affiliation with legal documents says Jim O'Donnell a senior vice president .
But gay rights advocates are angry too .
The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund of New York City has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline does n't recognize as family .
It 's certainly discrimination says attorney Evan Wolfson whose group forced Trans World Airlines this year to change a rule that allowed travelers to transfer frequent flier awards only to family members .
Take Your Vacation In a Hurricane Area WHEN HURRICANE Hugo careened through the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast states it downed electric and telephone lines shot coconuts through cottage rooftops shattered windows and uprooted thousands of lives .
It also lowered some air fares .
Since the hurricane Midway Airlines Inc. and American Airlines a unit of AMR Corp. trimmed their one-way fares to the Virgin Islands to 109 from prices that were at times double that before the storm .
The fares are code-named Hugo Compassion and Virgin Islands Aid .
Airlines are n't lowering fares to Northern California following this week 's earthquake but reservation agents can waive advance-purchase restrictions on discount fares for emergency trips .
Some hotels in the hurricane-stricken Caribbean promise money-back guarantees .
In Myrtle Beach S.C. the damaged Yachtsman Resort offers daily rates as low as 35 or as much as 22 % below regular prices .
Says Michele Hoffman a clerk in the resort 's front office We do n't have the outdoor pool the pool table ping pong table snack bar or VCR but we still have the indoor pool and Jacuzzi .
Just Wait Until You 're a Bit Older SENIOR CITIZENS have long received cheap air fares .
This year the older someone is the bigger the discount .
A senior citizen between 62 and 70 saves 70 % off regular coach fare .
Travelers up to age 99 get a percentage discount matching their age .
And centenarians fly free in first class .
Next month Northwest Airlines says a 108-year-old Lansing Mich. woman is taking it up on the offer to fly with her 72-year-old son to Tampa Fla .
Last year when Northwest first offered the promotion only six centenarians flew free .
If All Else Fails .
THE NATION'S carriers also provide discounts to Red Cross workers retired military personnel and medical students .
There 's even a special fare for clergy that does n't require the usual stay over Saturday night .
That way they can be home in time for work Sunday .
The British Petroleum Co. PLC said its BP Exploration unit has produced the first oil from its Don oilfield in the North Sea .
In an official release BP said initial production from the field was 11,000 barrels a day and that it expects peak output from the field of 15,000 barrels a day to be reached in 1990 .
As the sponsor of the Older Americans Freedom to Work Act which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil .
For every dollar earned over 8,880 Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits it 's like a 50 % marginal tax .
But the compounded effects of seniors only taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates .
Imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax .
Although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage largely due to the earnings limit she would have to earn an additional 4,930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of 496 .
Eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit .
Repeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased Social Security benefit payments .
We now need support from the Democrats on the Rules Committee in order to include earnings-limit reform in the Reconciliation Bill .
Since all four Republicans on the committee are co-sponsors of my bill it is the Democrats who will be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor .
The time is now to lift the burdensome Social Security earnings limit from the backs of our nation 's seniors .
Rep. J. Dennis Hastert R. Ill .
When his Seventh Avenue fur business here was flying high 20 years ago Jack Purnick had 25 workers and a large factory .
Now his half-dozen employees work in an eighth-floor shop that he says is smaller than his old storage room .
He also says he is losing money now .
He blames imports .
But just down Seventh Avenue where about 75 % of U.S. fur garments are made Larry Rosen has acquired two retail outlets broadened his fur-making line and expanded into leather .
He credits imports .
The difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10 years .
One stuck to old-line business traditions while the other embraced the change .
The small good fur salon is not what it used to be says Mr. Purnick 75 years old .
We make the finest product in the world and the Americans are being kicked around .
Mr. Rosen though believes imports have reinvigorated the industry in which he has worked for most of his 57 years .
You 've got some minds here that wo n't think progressively he says .
Import competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing working-girl mink and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years .
Merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers the younger woman even in her late 20s who never thought she could buy a mink .
The new market helped boost U.S. fur sales to about 1.8 billion a year now triple the level in the late 1970s .
It also opened the door to furs made in South Korea China Hong Kong and other countries .
Jindo Furs a large South Korean maker says it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next year .
Mr. Purnick and other old-line furriers call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made .
High-end U.S. furriers say these imports have n't squeezed them .
But low-priced and middle-priced furriers like Mr. Purnick who once saturated the five-block Seventh Avenue fur district say imports have cut their sales .
A woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a U.S.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than 2,000 .
Yet Mr. Rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage .
Early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their American counterparts and were more open to innovation .
In 1982 he started a factory in Greece .
Two years later he opened one in West Germany .
He also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur and he decided to follow suit .
By combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost .
To maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources he says he still makes most of his furs in the U.S. .
But six years ago he also began importing from the Far East .
Inspired by imports Mr. Rosen now makes fur muffs hats and flings .
This year he produced a men 's line and offers dyed furs in red cherry red violet royal blue and forest green .
He has leather jackets from Turkey that are lined with eel skin and topped off with raccoon-skin collars .
From Asia he has mink jackets with floral patterns made by using different colored furs .
Next he will be testing pictured embroidery called kalega made in the Far East .
He plans to attach the embroidery to the backs of mink coats and jackets .
Besides adding to sales leathers also attract retailers who may buy furs later he adds .
Other furriers have also benefited from leathers .
Seymour Schreibman the 65-year-old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc. treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment .
He says it accounts for 25 % of total sales .
Mr. Rosen is also pushing retail sales .
This year he bought two stores one in Brooklyn and one in Queens .
Other furriers have also placed more weight on retailing .
Golden Feldman Furs Inc. began retailing aggressively eight years ago and now retail sales account for about 20 % of gross income .
In other moves Mr. Rosen says he bought a truck three years ago to reach more retailers .
Since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the Midwest .
Small retailers who ca n't afford to travel to his New York showroom have become fair game .
Such moves have helped Mr. Rosen weather the industry slump of recent years .
The industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980 but since 1986 sales have languished at their 1.8 billion peak .
Large furriers such as Antonovich Inc. Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years .
Aftereffects of the 1987 stock market crash head the list of reasons .
In addition competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats driving prices down .
The animal-rights movement has n't helped sales .
Warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand too furriers complain .
And those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages .
The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs in the U.S. .
is not as available as it was says Mr. Schreibman who is starting overseas production .
But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump fear that furs are losing part of their allure .
People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business says Stephen Sanders divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago .
You ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury insists Mr. Purnick the New York furrier .
He contends that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs .
But Mr. Rosen responds Whatever people want to buy I 'll sell .
The name of the game is to move goods .
Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection company and city officials said .
The four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities .
GTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by GTE 's private food vending contractor ARA Services Inc. was suffering from a strain of the virus officials said .
More than 700 people work in the GTE building .
The cafeteria remains closed .
Dr. Andrew McBride city health director said his staff suspects the hepatitis which can be highly contagious was spread by the cafeteria worker with the virus .
The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week Dr. McBride said .
Hepatitis A considered the least dangerous strain of the virus has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee company and city officials said .
From a public health point of view we 're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening said Dr. Frank Provato GTE 's medical director .
It 's a double-edged sword though because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis .
GTE officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company said GTE spokesman Thomas Mattausch .
The company has begun offering shots of gamma globulin which will diminish the flu-like symptoms of hepatitis A in anyone who has contracted the disease Mr. Mattausch said .
We 're strongly recommending that anyone who has eaten in the cafeteria this month have the shot Mr. Mattausch added and that means virtually everyone who works here .

It is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers not the left wing .
This information was gleaned from your own news stories on the region .
Past Colombian government tolerance of the narcotraficantes was due to the drug lords ' history of wiping out leftists in the hinterlands .

In the wake of a slide in sterling a tailspin in the stock market and a string of problematic economic indicators British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy .
In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy using high interest rates as the essential instrument to carry out the campaign .
Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % he pledged that rates will have to remain high for some time to come .
Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation he argued .
In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency he stated that the exchange rates will have a major role in the assessment of monetary conditions .
In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy .
He said he monitors the money-supply figures but does n't give them paramount importance as some private and government economists have suggested .
Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system .
Mr. Lawson 's speech delivered at the Lord Mayor of London 's annual dinner at Mansion House came on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy .
Two weeks ago in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15 % .
Despite the increase the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week .
It was quoted at 2.9428 marks in late New York trading Wednesday .
Leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the British war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed .
Unemployment in September dropped to 1,695,000 the lowest level since 1980 .
While lower joblessness is generally good news the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as hoped despite a doubling of interest rates over the last 16 months .
Meanwhile average earnings in Britain were up 8.75 % in August over the previous year .
Another inflationary sign came in a surge in building-society lending to a record 10.2 billion 16.22 billion last month a much higher level than economists had predicted .
In a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner Robin Leigh-Pemberton Bank of England governor conceded that demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated when the British economy was heating up last year .
He added that there 's no quick-fix solution to the economic woes and said tight monetary policy is the right approach .
Discussing the recent slide in stock prices the central bank governor stated that the markets now appear to have steadied after the nasty jolt of the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average a week ago .
Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy .
Specifically he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings .
Discussing future monetary arrangements Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System but he did n't indicate when .

C. Olivetti & Co. claiming it has won the race in Europe to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip unveiled its CP486 computer yesterday .
The product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp. 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor which works several times faster than previously available chips .
Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year .
An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine and that it should be available in Europe by December .
What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do the spokesman said .
The new chip is a very big step in computing and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product said Patricia Meagher Davis an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London .
Executives at Olivetti whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market .
Ms. Davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti 's own minicomputers but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers stockbrokers and medical doctors .
Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year she believes Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December .
We think the worst is over in the European information-technology market she said .
Depending on the type of software and peripherals used the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals a role usually filled by a minicomputer as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer .
It 's the missing link in Olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers the Olivetti spokesman said .
He added that Olivetti will continue making its LSX minicomputer line .
The machines will cost around 16,250 on average in Europe .
The Intel 486 chip can process 15 million instructions per second or MIPS while Intel 's previous 386 chip could handle only 3 to 6 MIPS .
Olivetti also plans to sell the CP486 computer in the U.S. starting next year through Olivetti USA and through its ISC\/Bunker Ramo unit which specializes in automating bank-branch networks .
Viatech Inc. said it received approval from the French government for its proposed 44.7 million acquisition of Ferembal S.A .
The approval satisfies the remaining conditions of the purchase which is expected to close within two weeks .
erembal the second-largest maker of food cans in France had 1988 sales of 150 million .
Ferembal has 930 workers at four canning manufacturing plants and one plastic container facility .
Viatech makes flexible packaging films and machinery and materials for the food and pharmaceutical industries .
Social Security benefits will rise 4.7 % next year to keep pace with inflation boosting the average monthly benefit to 566 from 541 the Department of Health and Human Services announced .
The higher payments will start with Social Security checks received on Jan. 3 1990 .
Supplemental Security Income payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7 % starting with checks received on Dec. 29 1988 increasing the maximum SSI payment to 386 from 368 a month .
The inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the Social Security trust fund will rise to 50,400 in 1990 from 48,000 this year .
As mandated by law the tax rate will rise to 7.65 % in 1990 from 7.51 % and wo n't rise any further in the future .
This means that the maximum yearly Social Security tax paid by workers and employers each will rise 250.80 next year to 3,855.60 .
Beneficiaries aged 65 through 69 will be able to earn 9,360 without losing any Social Security benefits in 1990 up from 8,880 this year .
The exempt amount for beneficiaries under 65 will rise to 6,840 from 6,480 .
The adjustments reflect the increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year .
Health-care companies should get healthier in the third quarter .
Medical-supply houses are expected to report earnings increases of about 15 % on average for the third quarter despite sales increases of less than 10 % analysts say .
To offset sluggish sales growth companies have been cutting staff mostly through attrition and slowing the growth in research and development spending .
Sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers such as hospitals to hold down prices .
Suppliers were also hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar which makes sales abroad more difficult .
In some cases competition has squeezed margins .
Becton Dickinson & Co. for example faces stiff competition from a Japanese supplier in the important syringe market .
The Franklin Lakes N.J. company is expected to report sales growth of only 5 % to 6 % but should still maintain earnings growth of 10 % says Jerry E. Fuller an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc .
Among the first of the group to post results Abbott Laboratories said third-quarter net income jumped 14 % to 196 million or 88 cents a share from 172 million or 76 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales for the company based in Abbott Park Ill. rose 8.3 % to 1.31 billion from 1.21 billion .
Baxter International Inc. yesterday reported net climbed 20 % in the third period to 102 million or 34 cents a share from 85 million or 28 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales for the Deerfield Ill. company rose 5.8 % to 1.81 billion from 1.71 billion .
But not every company expects to report increased earnings .
C.R. Bard Inc. yesterday said third-quarter net plunged 51 % to 9.9 million or 18 cents a share from 20 million or 35 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales fell 1.2 % to 190.1 million from 192.5 million .
The Murray Hill N.J. company said full-year earnings may be off 33 cents a share because the company removed a catheter from the market .
In 1988 the company earned 1.38 a share .
The Food and Drug Administration had raised questions about the device 's design .
Some analysts add that third-party pressures to reduce health costs will continue to bedevil companies ' bottom lines .
Takeover speculation which has been buoying stocks of supply houses may also ease says Peter Sidoti an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
As that wanes you 're going to see the stocks probably wane as well he says .
Hospitals companies meanwhile are reporting improved earnings .
Bolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals National Medical Enterprises Inc. Los Angeles reported net income of 50 million or 65 cents a share for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 up from 41 million or 56 cents a share a year earlier .
Humana Inc. Louisville Ky. also reported favorable results with net income of 66.7 million or 66 cents in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 up from 58.2 million or 59 cents a year earlier .
Analysts say the handful of hospital companies that are still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends .
Most important hospital admission rates are stabilizing after several years of decline .
Moreover companies have sold off many of their smaller less-profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings .
Humana 's revenues for example are being boosted by large increases in enrollments in the company 's health maintenance organizations .
Says Todd Richter an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds The shakeout in the publicly traded companies is over .
Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 396,000 during the week ended Oct. 7 from 334,000 the previous week the Labor Department said .
The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 or 2.2 % of those covered by unemployment insurance from 2,205,000 the previous week when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2 % .
Counting all state and federal benefit programs the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier .
These figures are n't seasonally adjusted .
A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states particularly North Carolina and South Carolina .
The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits the official said .
Digital Equipment Corp. reported a 32 % decline in net income on a modest revenue gain in its fiscal first quarter causing some analysts to predict weaker results ahead than they had expected .
Although the second-largest computer maker had prepared Wall Street for a poor quarter analysts said they were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders .
The Maynard Mass. company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on mid-range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes .
Net for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to 150.8 million or 1.20 a share from 223 million or 1.71 a share a year ago .
Revenue rose 6.4 % to 3.13 billion from 2.94 billion .
Digital said a shift in its product mix toward low-end products and strong growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins .
A spokesman also said margins for the company 's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector .
The lack of a strong product at the high end of Digital 's line was a significant drag on sales .
Digital hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe-class computers next Tuesday .
The new line is aimed directly at International Business Machines Corp .
Until the new mainframe products kick in there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end and that 's hurt us said Mark Steinkrauss Digital 's director of investor relations .
He said unfavorable currency translations were also a factor in the quarter .
DEC shares rose 1.375 to 89.75 apiece in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday .
But analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly 40-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength .
Some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead .
I think the next few quarters will be difficult said Steven Milunovich of First Boston .
Margins will remain under pressure and when the new mainframe does ship I 'm not sure it will be a big winner .
Mr. Milunovich said he was revising his estimate for DEC 's current year from 8.20 a share to well below 8 although he has n't settled on a final number .
One troubling aspect of DEC 's results analysts said was its performance in Europe .
DEC said its overseas business which now accounts for more than half of sales improved in the quarter .
It even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in Europe were up in double digits in foreign-currency terms .
That gain probably translated into about 5 % to 7 % in dollar terms well below recent quarters ' gains of above 20 % reckons Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds .
That was a disappointment and a sign of overall computer-market softness in Europe Mr. Stevens said .
Marc Schulman with UBS Securities in New York dropped his estimate of DEC 's full-year net to 6.80 a share from 8 .
Although overall revenues were stronger Mr. Schulman said DEC drew down its European backlog and had flat world-wide orders overall .
The bottom line is that it 's more hand to mouth than it has been before he said .
Mr. Schulman said he believes that the roll-out of DEC 's new mainframe will occur somewhat more leisurely than many of his investment colleagues expect .
He said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in December with all of the more sophisticated versions out by June .
For reasons he would n't elaborate on he said he 's sure that schedule wo n't be met meaning less profit impact from the product for DEC in the next few quarters .

Colgate Palmolive Co. reported third-quarter net income rose 27 % bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from U.S. operations .
Colgate said net income for the quarter rose to 76.7 million or 1.06 a share on sales that increased 6 % to 1.3 billion .
In the year-earlier period Colgate posted net income of 60.2 million or 88 cents a share .
Last year 's results included earnings from discontinued operations of 13.1 million or 19 cents a share .
Reuben Mark chairman and chief executive officer of Colgate said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in Latin America the Far East and Europe .
Results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. business he said .
Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal care businesses which include such well-known brands as Colgate toothpaste and Fab laundry detergent jumped more than 40 % the company said .
Mr. Mark attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities .
We 've done a lot to improve U.S. .
results and a lot more will be done Mr. Mark said .
Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company .
Colgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts .
The scope of the improvement in the U.S. business caught some analysts by surprise .
The company 's domestic business especially its household products division has performed poorly for years .
Analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales .
For the nine months net increased 14 % to 217.5 million or 3.09 a share .
Sales rose 7 % to 3.8 billion .
The company earned 191.1 million or 2.79 a share in the year-earlier period .
Colgate 's 1988 net income included 40.1 million or 59 cents a share from discontinued operations .
Colgate sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year .
Separately Colgate Wednesday finalized an agreement with MacroChem Corp. a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in Billerica Mass. to market in the U.S. four of MacroChem 's FDA-approved dental products .
The products sealants and bonding materials used by dentists all contain fluoride that is released over time .
The move is part of a drive to increase Colgate 's business with dentists a company spokeswoman said .
Terms of the agreement were n't given .
USACafes Limited Partnership said it completed the sale of its Bonanza restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of Metromedia Co. for 71 million in cash .
USACafes which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible .
The Bonanza franchise system which generates about 600 million in sales annually represented substantially all of the partnership 's assets .
The sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a Delaware court USACafes said .
The company said it believes the suit is without merit .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes will enable it to save 450 million in the next year .
AT&T also said net income rose 19 % in the third quarter .
AT&T said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments .
AT&T said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program .
AT&T said third-quarter net income grew despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets .
Net income rose to 699 million or 65 cents a share from the year-earlier 587 million or 55 cents a share .
Revenue edged up to 8.9 billion from 8.81 billion .
The latest period 's net was reduced 102 million or nine cents a share for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment .
The results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts who were encouraged by AT&T increasing its operating margin to 13 % from 11 % a year ago because of continued cost-cutting efforts .
Sales of long-distance services an extremely competitive market rose 6.4 % .
But the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products .
Under the amended pension program AT&T managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes .
Managers who retire Dec. 30 will have an additional 15 % added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65 whichever comes earlier .
An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees .
Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months .
This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth said Jack Grubman an analyst with PaineWebber Inc .
But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth .
This is a good move but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are in terms of earnings growth said Joel D. Gross an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette .
Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts it expects in the future .
AT&T said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses .
But the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire .
AT&T said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in Ing .
C. Olivetti & Co. for shares in Cie .
Industriali Riunite an Italian holding company .
For the nine months AT&T said net income was 1.99 billion or 1.85 a share up 19 % from 1.67 billion or 1.56 a share .
Revenue gained 3.1 % to 26.81 billion from 26 billion .
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange AT&T shares closed at 43.375 up 87.5 cents .
When it comes to buying and selling shares Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one .
Every dollar 's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year the firm estimates .
That makes it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
But wait a second .
Westridge Capital is an index fund the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average .
Westridge Capital 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing .
Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer such as Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index and match its performance .
Institutional investors have poured 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns .
These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few active stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers much less beat it .
And the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each 100 of assets a fraction of the cost of active managers .
That 's because computers do most of the work and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs .
But today indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one .
Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average they have developed enhanced indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points .
Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade but the index money has been just sort of sitting there says Seth M. Lynn president of Axe Core Investors Inc. an indexer based in Tarrytown N.Y .
Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money .
Among the souped-up indexing strategies Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks or just a few dozen rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies .
They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks such as smaller companies those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry state or country .
With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 .
Futures and options also make it possible to build synthetic index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market .
One reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing particularly for those plain vanilla funds that mirror the S&P 500 .
There is n't a boatload of big investors out there still waiting to get into indexing says P. James Kartalia vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. Chicago which offers both indexing and active management services .
After tripling in size in the past five years index funds now hold about 20 % of the stock owned by pension funds .
A further problem is razor-thin profits .
Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing and in some cases are just that .
To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free .
It 's like getting a free toaster when you open an account says Axe Core 's Mr. Lynn .
As a result indexers have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money .
And many have been successful as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader Westridge Capital .
Westridge Capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the S&P 500 's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage points over the past four years with the same risk level as holding the S&P 500 stocks according to James Carder the firm 's president .
Strategies vary for Westridge Capital which has 300 million under management .
The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies .
Mr. Carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines .
And in some months he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all .
By their nature our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover Mr. Carder adds .
The more turnover the better for our clients .
Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns .
J. Thomas Allen president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures .
You 're buying the S&P and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it he says .
But some indexers make little or no use of futures saying that these instruments present added risks for investors .
If the futures markets have a problem then those products could have a problem says John Zumbrunn managing director of Prudential Insurance Co. of America 's Investment Index Technologies Inc. unit .
Prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus 5\/100 of a percentage point .
An added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by Prudential .
There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds .
They include LIMITED RISK FUNDS These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains .
Here a fund may promise to pay back say 95 of every 100 invested for a year even if the market goes much lower .
The fund could invest 87 for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8 % to return the guaranteed 95 .
That leaves 13 which could be used to buy S&P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the S&P index .
MANAGER REPLICATION FUNDS Say a big investor is interested in growth stocks .
Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks the portfolio will be maintained by computer reducing both fees and in theory risk because of the large number of stocks .
We see a lot of interest in those kind of things says Frank Salerno a vice president of Bankers Trust .
People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies .
TILT FUNDS This is an index fund with a bet .
Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio .
One simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates this can avoid weak sisters but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds .
Another approach An investor with 100 million might use 75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other 25 million on a favorite group of stocks .
SPECIALIZED FUNDS Indexes can be constructed to serve social goals such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa .
Other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment .
Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System for example has about 130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either Pennsylvania-based or have 25 % of their work forces in the state .
Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month this time 4.2 % while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive recor
