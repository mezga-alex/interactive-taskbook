to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients ' money .
Alarmed state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners .
Industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards too they 're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine .
But reform has n't taken hold yet .
The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days says Scott Stapf director of investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Association .
An admittedly limited survey by NASAA whose members are state securities-law regulators found that between 1986 and 1988 fraud and abuse by financial planners cost 22,000 investors 400 million .
The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons a compulsive gambler or two various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother .
What 's more the losses they and the others caused are just what we are stumbling over says Mr. Stapf adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected .
So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners .
Nobody can estimate the toll but John Gargan a Tampa Fla. planner and head of one trade group the International Association of Registered Financial Planners thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is humongous far greater than that from crookery .
His group like others wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners .
Surveying all this some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all .
For most investors the benefits just are n't worth the risks says Barbara Roper who follows financial-planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America a consumer-advocacy organization based in Washington .
She concedes that such a position is unfair to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it .
She says her group used to give tips on selecting planners check educational and experience credentials consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus but found that even some people who took these steps were still getting ripped off .
The bad news however has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning .
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business .
But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners IAFP the industry 's biggest trade group is still nearly triple what it was in 1980 and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well .
An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners and the pool of capital they influence is enormous .
A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months .
The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult if not impossible to regulate .
Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as investment advisers people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity .
The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers about the same as in 1980 even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade .
Currently a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years .
A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years .
It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem says Kathryn McGrath director of the SEC 's division of investment management .
So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers which operates in the brokerage business .
Such an organization could among other things set minimum standards for competence ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules .
The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with .
Mr. Schwartz the puckish planner from Englewood Colo. says that allowing the business to police itself would be like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank .
Mr. Gargan the Tampa planner who heads one trade group favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff .
Mr. Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP the major industry organization .
When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners Mr. Gargan 's group was excluded .
That may be because Mr. Gargan smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group enrolled his dog Beauregard as a member of the IAFP .
Then he sent the pooch 's picture with the certificate of membership it was made out to Boris Bo Regaard to every newspaper he could think of .
The states have their own ideas about regulation and certification .
NASAA the organization of state securities regulators is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states .
It requires financial planners to register with states pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest .
The most common conflict involves compensation .
NASAA estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they recommend .
The issue Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments or the ones that garner the biggest commissions .
In 1986 the New York attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp. an Albany financial-planning firm that had invested 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors .
In its notice of action the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into balanced investment portfolios instead the attorney general alleged the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings coins and Florida condos .
Those investments paid big commissions to First Meridian payments investors were never told about the attorney general alleged .
Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted .
In practice the attorney general alleged in an affidavit if an investor had access to cash the chances of being turned down by First Meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month Club .
And the attorney general added First Meridian 's president Roger V. Sala portrayed himself as a financial expert when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma work as a real-estate and insurance salesman and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth .
First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general .
Harry Manion Mr. Sala 's attorney says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general 's contentions about First Meridian 's business practices are incorrect .
As for Mr. Sala 's qualifications the snooty attorneys for the state of New York decided Mr. Sala was n't qualified because he did n't have a Harvard degree says Mr. Manion .
Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common .
Two such actions both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta could be particularly embarrassing to the industry both name J. Chandler Peterson an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP as defendant .
One suit filed by more than three dozen investors charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest .
Those companies in turn paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees the suit alleges .
The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale Ariz .
One plaintiff a doctor testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician the privilege of making additional investments with Mr. Peterson .
In affidavits each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned .
Mr. Peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors .
Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots he opened up his briefcase and dumped 1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors says Myron Diebel the bank 's president .
He said he wanted to show the color of his money recalls Mr. Diebel .
Bank officials however showed him the door and the sale never came off .
According to the suit Mr. Peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment .
They want it back .
Mr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits saying he prefers to save such responses for court .
But he does say that all of his activities have been entirely proper .
On the suit by the limited partners he says he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs .
The suit he adds is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people .
Rearding the suit over the bank bid Mr. Peterson says it is filled with inflammatory language and half truths .
He declines to go into specifics .
Mr. Peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a sign of the times in which people generally are more prone to sue .
I do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation he says .
Mr. Peterson also says he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore .
He now calls himself an investment banker .
In many scams or alleged scams involving planners it 's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm 's way .
Using it would n't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner .
Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies If it sounds too good to be true it probably is .
Certificates of deposit do n't pay 23 % a year for example but that did n't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner .
Now they 're losers and he 's in jail in Mobile County .
CDs yielding 40 % are even more implausible especially when the issuing bank in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator but investors fell for that one too .
And the Colorado planner who promised to make some of his clients millionaires on investments of as litle as 100 .
Never mind .
You already know the answer .
Mr. Emshwiller is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Los Angeles bureau .
At the ritzy Fashion Island Shopping Center the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy Southern California beach community disembark from their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs for another day of exercising their credit cards .
They root among the designer offerings at Neiman-Marcus and Bullocks Wilshire .
They stroll through the marble-encased corridors of the Atrium Court .
They graze at the Farmers Market a combination gourmet food court and grocery store while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies .
The beautiful look of wool croons the show 's narrator slightly Victorian in its influence .
Meanwhile in the squat office buildings that ring Fashion Island the odds are good that someone is getting fleeced .
Law-enforcement authorities say that at any given time a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here .
They seem to like these industrial parks says Kacy McClelland a postal inspector who specializes in mail fraud .
We call them fraud farms .
Welcome to that welter of contradictions known as Newport Beach .
This city of more than 70,000 is known for sunshine yachts and rich residents .
It is also known as the fraud capital of the U.S. dubbed by investigators and the media as the Cote de Fraud .
How does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for low-lifes .
Clearly the existence of the former lures the latter .
The places renowned for breeding bunco like the Miami neighborhood known as the Maggot Mile and Las Vegas 's flashy strip of casinos invariably offer fast cars high rollers glamorous women and lots of sunshine .
You do n't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in Green Bay or Buffalo .
Con men hate snow .
Newport Beach fits the scam artists ' specifications perfectly .
What more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for .
Nothing seems hard here .
The breezes are soft the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily .
Nightlife is plentiful .
Moreover ostentation is appreciated .
The median price of homes is 547,000 more than 9,000 vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest pleasure-boat harbor .
Blondes cocaine and Corvettes mutters Mr. McClelland .
That 's what they 're after .
The rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability .
One reason they use Newport Beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses says David Katz a U.S. attorney who until recently headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force .
Newport Beach is known in Rhode Island for having a lot of rich people .
No wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here from phony tax-sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders .
But above all this is the national headquarters for boiler-room operators those slick-talking snake-oil salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish .
Because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest .
I 've heard that there is 40 billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year Mr. McClelland says .
If that 's true Orange County has to be at least 10 % of that .
And most of the truly big scams in Orange County seem to originate in Newport Beach or one of the other well-heeled communities that surround this sliver-like city that hooks around a point of land on the California coast south of Los Angeles .
In fact sophisticated big-bucks boiler-room scams are known generically among law-enforcement types as Newport Beach operations .
That contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as Hollywood scams .
Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot .
The investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals .
In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses caused by employees due to dishonesty destruction or disappearance according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month .
Thus falsely reassured investors sent 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses the indictment charges .
Douglas Jones an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr. the chairman and president of Capital Trust says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors .
There were some business deals that went bad Mr. Jones says but no intent to defraud .
Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars .
Traditionally boiler rooms operate on the cheap since few if any customers ever visit their offices .
Indeed the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space near the boiler room .
But says Mr. Katz the U.S. attorney the interesting thing about Newport Beach operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices with plush furnishings .
When we go there it 's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses .
The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately .
Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals .
Mr. Valentine who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle an island in Newport 's harbor according to investigators .
With the 3 million received from investors he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits .
It 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas Mr. Katz says .
All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element .
Vincent M Ciavarella regional manager of Property Management Systems insists he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co. the owner and developer of the project .
Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided incomplete financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators are not easily detectable .
Investigators stress that building owners are victims too since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent .
Richard Luehrs president of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce calls boiler rooms a negative we wish we could get rid of .
Actually we do n't get much negative publicity about this he insists except for the press who write about it .
Mr. Lancaster is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal 's Dallas bureau .
YOU WENT to college and thought you got an education .
Now you discover that you never learned the most important lesson How to send your kids to college .
True when you went to college there was n't that much to learn .
Stick some money in an interest-bearing account and watch it grow .
Now investment salesmen say it 's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your toddler a ticket to Prestige U. in 18 years .
In short throw away the passbook and go for the glory .
The reason is cost .
Nothing in the annals of tuition readied parents for the 1980s .
Tuitions at private colleges rose 154 % in the 10 years ended in June of this year that 's twice the 77 % increase in consumer prices for the same period .
A year at Harvard now goes for 19,395 .
By 2007 when this year 's newborns hit campus a four-year Ivy League sheepskin will cost 300,000 give or take a few pizzas-with-everything at exam time .
Stanford MIT and other utmosts will cost no less .
So what 's a parent to do .
Some investment advisers are suggesting in effect a bet on a start-up investment pool maybe even on margin .
Others prefer deep-discount zero-coupon bonds .
Still others say Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund .
You 're not going to make it in a 5 % bank account says James Riepe director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price .
To get the necessary growth adds Murray Ruffel a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group you need to go to the stock market .
In other words a little volatility never hurt .
It never hurt anyone that is unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to .
Or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid 's tuition .
That 's the dilemma for today 's parent .
Although many experts are advising risk no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off .
Help may be on the way .
The antitrust division of the Justice Department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools .
Fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s .
And then there 's always State U .
But parents ' craving for a top-rated education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine .
Belatedly aware of public concern lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes .
Their message explicit or implicit is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore .
Forget about Treasury bills or a money-market fund .
The latest wave of marketing is instructive .
Several outfits including the Financial Programs Franklin and T. Rowe Price mutual-fund groups and the Edward D. Jones brokerage house are advertising college planner tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly .
The calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of 8 % annually a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one place the stock market .
Most of the mailers are free but Denver-based Financial Programs sells for 15 a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice .
The figures are shocking .
To build a nest egg that would pay for Stanford when a current first-grader reaches college age parents would need to set aside 773.94 a month for 12 years .
They can cut this to 691.09 a month if the investing keeps up through college .
And they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier when mother and child come home from the hospital .
Plugging a cheaper college into the formulas still does n't generate an installment most people can live with .
Using a recent average private-school cost of about 12,500 a year T. Rowe Price 's planner prescribes 450 monthly if the plan begins when the child is six .
Since the formula assumes an 8 % before-tax return in a mutual fund there would also be 16,500 in taxes to pay over the 12 years .
Not everyone is so pessimistic .
People are basically peddling a lot of fear says Arthur Hauptman a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington .
He takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution which reduces most parents ' burden substantially .
Still he says it 's no bad thing if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more .
The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income he says .
That 's crazy .
His advice Do n't panic .
Parents he says should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford .
Half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal he adds .
That way parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition .
Mr. Hauptman reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages .
He favors either an all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds .
In their anxiety however parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes .
They have laid out about 1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bonds so far offered by Connecticut Illinois Virginia and eight other states .
And they have bought about 500 million in prepaid-tuition plans offered in Michigan Florida and Wyoming .
The prepaid plans take payment today usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow .
The baccalaureate bonds tax-free offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity seem to be tailor-made for college savers .
Like other zeros they pay all their interest at maturity meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when Junior graduates from high school .
Their compounding effect is also alluring .
In June Virginia sold bonds for 268.98 that will pay 1,000 in 2009 .
But Richard Anderson head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives at Columbia University a research group partly financed by the federal government says zeros are particularly ill-suited .
Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up .
That wo n't matter if they are held to maturity but if for any reason the parents need to sell them before then there could be a severe loss of principal .
Had zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time aiming for their children 's 1988 enrollment they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years Mr. Anderson figures .
Most other bonds however would probably not have fared much better .
The prepaid plans may be a good bet provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure .
Issuing states generally limit the guarantees to in-state institutions however and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools .
Two private groups are seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval for plans that could be more broadly transferable .
Mr. Anderson wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan .
The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee .
Prepayments much like mutual-fund purchases are pooled for investment .
Sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns .
But buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so .
One problem is that the Internal Revenue Service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable .
The colleges as educational institutions had hoped that would n't be the case .
Based on historical rates of return Mr. Anderson reckons a 100 % stock portfolio indexed to the market would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century .
But sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market .
And they 're leaning more toward fixed income whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases .
I 'm not sure they 're going to make it work says Mr. Anderson .
What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions .
Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack .
Not so Michigan .
Its plan is set up as an independent agency .
The state says there 's no worry investment returns combined with fees and the gains from unused plans will provide all the cash it needs .
Mr. Putka covers education from The Wall Street Journal 's Boston bureau .
If you start saving for your child 's eduction on Jan. 1 1990 here 's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at Yale Notre Dame and University of Minnesota .
Figures assume a 7 % annual rise in tuition fees room and board and an 8 % annual investment return .
Note These figures are only for mandatory charges and do n't include books transportation etc .

AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County Miss. Allen D. Tharp of Isola was one of the best known and most enterprising .
He sold quarter-inch fingerlings to stock other farmers ' ponds and he bought back one-pound-or-so food-fish that he live-hauled to market along with his own whiskery crop .
And he nearly always bought and sold for cash .
Along the way Mr. Tharp omitted a total of 1.5 million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years .
The returns landed in the hands of an Internal Revenue Service criminal investigator Samuel James Baker .
Mr. Baker interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers live-haulers and processors throughout the South before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales in pounds and dollars by Mr. Tharp and others .
Unknown to Mr. Tharp he had fouled his net on a special IRS project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes .
Confronted with the evidence Mr. Tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined 5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison .
He also owes a lot of back taxes interest and civil fraud penalties .
A lot of taxpayers out there are n't as paranoid as one might think .
