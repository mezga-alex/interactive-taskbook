PLASTIC PENCILS CODE-NAMED E-71 made their hush-hush debut in children 's pencil boxes at five-and-dime stores in 1973 .
But few knew it then and most still think all pencils are wooden .
Eagle Pencil of Shelbyville Tenn. Pencil City U.S.A. had made its earliest pilot plastic pencils in 1971 .
But it was n't until after it hired Arthur D. Little a Cambridge Mass. research concern that its new product was refined for commercial sale in 1973 .
Three A.D.L. inventors applied April 6 1973 for the patent which was assigned and awarded in 1976 to Hasbro Industries then Eagle 's parent .
Pencil pushers chew and put the plastic models behind their ears just like traditional pencils made of glued strips of California incense cedar filled with ceramic lead .
It takes five steps to make standard pencils just one for the plastic type .
Automated machines coextrude long plastic sheaths with graphite-plastic cores that are printed cut painted and eraser-fitted .
After more than 200 years something new has happened to pencils said Arthur D. Little in a 1974 report that publicly described the previously secret item .
Eagle 's plastic type sharpens and looks like a wooden pencil .
A major difference is that a snapped wooden pencil will have a slivered break while a plastic model will break cleanly .
The softness of the core constrains the plastic models to No. 1 No. 2 or No. 3-type pencils which account for the bulk of the market .
Artists and draftsmen need harder leads .
Eagle now called Eagle-Berol remains a leading company among the 10 in the U.S. that produced about 2.3 billion pencils last year according to the Pencil Makers Association .
It 's a trade secret how many were plastic and most writers still do n't know what they 're using .
H.F. Ahmanson & Co. the nation 's largest thrift holding company posted a 12 % earnings decline for the third quarter while another large California savings and loan Great Western Financial Corp. reported a slight earnings gain .
H.F. Ahmanson parent of Home Savings of America reported third-quarter net of 49.2 million or 50 cents a share down from 56.1 million or 57 cents a share in the year-earlier period .
Most of the earnings decline reflected an increase in the company 's effective tax rate to 44 % from 37 % in the year-ago third quarter when nonrecurring tax credits were recorded the company said .
Pretax earnings declined 1.3 % .
For the nine months Los Angeles-based H.F. Ahmanson had profit of 128.1 million or 1.29 a share a 4.6 % decline from earnings of 134.2 million in the year-ago nine months .
The company said the decline was attributable to a 79 % reduction in net gains on loan sales this year .
Third-quarter spreads widened to the highest level in two years as loan portfolio yields rose and money costs declined the company said .
Great Western Financial said third-quarter profit rose slightly to 68.4 million or 52 cents a share from 67.9 million or 53 cents a share from a year ago .
Great Western based in Beverly Hills Calif. is a financial services firm and parent to Great Western Bank an S&L .
Great Western said it had a sharp increase in margins in the recent third quarter .
Margins are the difference between the yield on the company 's earning assets and its own cost of funds .
But a reduction in one-time gains on the sale of various assets and an increase in the company 's provision for loan losses held down the earnings gain the company said .
Great Western 's provision for loan losses was increased to 27.9 million for the recent quarter compared with 21.8 million a year ago primarily as a result of continued weakness in various commercial and multifamily real estate markets outside California .
For the nine months Great Western posted net of 177.5 million or 1.37 a share a 5.9 % decline from 188.7 million or 1.48 a share in the year-ago period .
Dun & Bradstreet Corp. posted a 15 % rise in third-quarter earnings .
But revenue declined more than 2 % reflecting in part a continuing drop in sales of credit services in the wake of controversy over the company 's sales practices .
The information company also cited the stronger dollar the sale last year of its former Official Airline Guides unit and other factors .
Net income rose to a record 155.3 million or 83 cents a share from 134.8 million or 72 cents a share .
Revenue fell to 1.04 billion from 1.07 billion .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Dun & Bradstreet closed yesterday at 53.75 down 25 cents a share .
Analysts said the results were as expected but several added that the earnings masked underlying weaknesses in several businesses .
The quality of earnings was n't as high as I expected said Eric Philo an analyst for Goldman Sachs & Co .
For example he noted operating profit was weaker than he had anticipated but nonoperating earnings of 14.6 million and a lower tax rate helped boost net income .
Dun & Bradstreet said operating earnings rose 8 % excluding the sale of Official Airline Guides .
Third-quarter sales of U.S. credit services were disappointingly below sales of a year earlier Dun & Bradstreet said .
As previously reported those sales have been declining this year in the wake of allegations that the company engaged in unfair sales practices that encouraged customers to overpurchase services .
The company has denied the allegations but has negotiated a proposed 18 million settlement of related lawsuits .
Analysts predict the sales impact will linger .
There is n't much question there will continue to be a ripple effect said John Reidy an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
Dun & Bradstreet noted that price competition in its Nielsen Marketing Research Nielsen Clearing House and Donnelley Marketing businesses also restrained revenue growth .
It cited cyclical conditions in its Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and D&B Plan Services units .
For the nine months net income rose 19 % to 449 million or 2.40 a share from 375.9 million or 2.01 a share a year earlier .
Year-earlier earnings reflected costs of 14.3 million related to the acquisition of IMS International .
Revenue rose slightly to 3.16 billion from 3.13 billion .
Control Data Corp. said it licensed its airline yield-management software to the International Air Transport Association .
Terms include a royalty arrangement but details were n't disclosed .
The computer equipment and financial services company said IATA a trade group will sell access to the package to its 180 airline members world-wide .
Control Data will receive revenue linked to the number of passengers served by the software IATA said .
The package helps carriers solve pricing problems such as how to react to discounts offered by competitors or what would be the optimum number of seats to offer at a given price .
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said it decided to proceed with installation of automatic gauge and shape controls at its 60-inch tandem cold rolling mill in Allenport Pa .
The new equipment which will produce steel sheet with more uniform thickness and flatness is likely to cost more than 20 million the company said .
When the company last considered adding the equipment two years ago it estimated the cost at 21 million to 22 million but a task force will have to prepare a detailed plan before the company can predict the current cost .
The time schedule for installing the equipment also will be developed by the task force the company said .

In the long frightening night after Tuesday 's devastating earthquake Bay Area residents searched for comfort and solace wherever they could .
Some found it on the screen of a personal computer .
Hundreds of Californians made their way to their computers after the quake and checked in with each other on electronic bulletin boards which link computers CB-radio-style via phone lines .
Some of the most vivid bulletins came over The Well a Sausalito Calif. board that is one of the liveliest outposts of the electronic underground .
About two-thirds of the Well 's 3,000 subscribers live in the Bay Area .
The quake knocked The Well out for six hours but when it came back up it teemed with emotional first-hand reports .

I could also see the clouds across the bay from the horrible fire in the Marina District of San Francisco .

I was in Stinson Beach when the quake rolled through town .
At first we were unfazed .
Then as things got rougher we ran for the door and spent the next few minutes outside watching the brick sidewalk under our feet oozing up and down and the flowers waving in an eerie rhythm .
Amazing what it does to one 's heart rate and one 's short-term memory .

Cupboard doors were flying the trash can in the kitchen walked a few feet the dogs came running and I scooted them into the dog run and stood in the doorway myself watching the outside trash cans dance across the concrete .

Georgia-Pacific Corp. exceeding some analysts ' expectations said third-quarter earnings rose 56 % to 178 million or 2.03 a share from 114 million or 1.19 a share in the year-earlier period .
Sales increased 10 % to 2.65 billion from 2.41 billion .
Per-share earnings were enhanced by the company 's share buy-back program which reduced the average shares outstanding to 87.5 million in the quarter from 95.8 million in the same quarter of 1988 .
With strong prices in the company 's two major areas building products as well as pulp and paper analysts had expected a roaring quarter .
But the performance exceeded some estimates of around 1.90 a share .
Fueling the growth among other things were higher-than-expected prices for certain building products .
One reason efforts to protect the spotted owl led to restrictions on logging in the Pacific Northwest constricting supply and forcing prices up .
Another reason strikes both at Georgia-Pacific and other lumber companies also cut supplies and raised prices analysts said .
For the nine months Georgia-Pacific 's earnings increased 49 % to 504 million or 5.58 a share from 338 million or 3.41 a share .
Sales rose 11 % to 7.73 billion from 6.94 billion .
In composite New York Stock Exchange Trading Georgia-Pacific stock rose 1.25 a share yesterday to close at 58 .
The House Public Works and Transportation Committee approved a bill that would give the Transportation Department power to block airline leveraged buy-outs despite a clear veto threat from the Bush administration .
The 23-5 vote clears the way for consideration on the House floor next week or the week after .
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner in a letter to the committee warned that he would urge President Bush to veto the legislation if it passed Congress .
The Senate Commerce Committee already has approved similar legislation .
On Monday a letter from Mr. Skinner 's deputy Elaine Chao said the administration opposed the legislation in its present form .
Some of the bill 's supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter was n't signed by Mr. Skinner and that it did n't contain a veto threat .
The stepped-up administration warnings annoyed some lawmakers especially senior Republicans who supported the bill because they thought the Transportation Department favored it .
We backed this bill because we thought it would help Skinner one Republican said and now we 're out there dangling in the wind .
A few weeks ago Mr. Skinner testified before Congress that it would be cleaner more efficient if he had authority to block buy-outs in advance .
But he never took an official position on the bill and has steadfastly maintained that he already has enough authority to deal with buy-outs .
Under the committee bill the Transportation secretary would have 30 days and an additional 20 days if needed to review any proposed purchase of 15 % or more of a major U.S. airline 's voting stock .
The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier 's ability to compete or if it gave control to a foreign interest .
Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt .
Supporters of the bill are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt .
The panel 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market .
It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort Rep. James Oberstar D. Minn. chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee said during the panel 's deliberations .
I do n't believe in the airline business you can be totally laissez-faire because of the high degree of public interest at stake .
But Mr. Skinner disagreed calling the legislation a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry .
In his letter to Committee Chairman Glenn Anderson D. Calif. the secretary also said the bill would be at odds with the administration 's policies welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources .
Currently the Transportation Department does n't have the authority to block a takeover in advance .
However if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier unfit to operate the department may revoke its certificate grounding the airline .
Such authority is more than adequate say opponents of the legislation .
But supporters argue that grounding an airline is so drastic that the department would hesitate doing it .
The panel rejected a proposal pushed by AMR Corp. the parent of American Airlines to allow the Transportation secretary to block corporate raiders from waging proxy fights to oust boards that oppose a leveraged buy-out .
It also voted down proposals to give the secretary much more discretion on whether to block a buy-out and to require the department to consider the impact of a buy-out on workers .
London shares rallied to post strong gains after initial fears evaporated that the California earthquake would depress Wall Street prices .
Tokyo stocks which rebounded strongly Tuesday extended their gains yesterday but most other Asian and Pacific markets closed sharply lower .
In London the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped 34.6 points to close at its intraday high of 2170.1 .
The index was under pressure for most of the morning over concerns that the effects of Tuesday night 's major earthquake in the San Francisco area would undermine the U.S. market .
The mood changed after dealers reappraised the direct impact of the disaster on shares and Wall Street rebounded from early losses .
The Financial Times 30-share index settled 27.8 points higher at 1758.5 .
Volume was 449.3 million shares the slowest of a hectic week compared with 643.4 million Tuesday .
U.K. composite or non-life insurers which some equity analysts said might be heavily hit by the earthquake disaster helped support the London market by showing only narrow losses in early trading .
The insurers ' relative resilience gave the market time to reappraise the impact of the California disaster on U.K. equities dealers said .
Dealers said the market still has n't shaken off its nervousness after its bumpy ride of the past several sessions caused by interest-rate increases last week and Wall Street 's 6.9 % plunge Friday .
But technical factors including modest gains in the value of the pound helped draw buying back into the market and reverse losses posted a day earlier .
Among composite insurers General Accident rose 10 pence to 10.03 15.80 a share Guardian Royal climbed 5 to 217 pence Sun Alliance rose 3 to 290 and Royal Insurance jumped 12 to 450 .

Pearl Group rose 5 to 628 and Sun Life finished unchanged at 10.98 .
Most banking issues retreated after a sector downgrade by Warburg Securities although National Westminister showed strength on positive comments from brokerage firms about its long-term prospects .
NatWest the most actively traded of the banks finished at 300 up 1 .
B.A.T Industries fell in early dealings but recovered to finish at 754 up 5 .
Dealers said the market was nervous ahead of a special B.A.T holders ' meeting today .
The session is to consider a defensive plan to spin off assets to fend off Sir James Goldsmith 's 13.4 billion bid for B.A.T .
The recent stock market drop has shaken confidence in the plan but dealers said the shares fell initially on questions about whether Mr. Goldsmith 's highly leveraged bid will come to fruition .

In early trading in Tokyo Thursday the Nikkei index rose 135.09 points to 35242.65 .
On Wednesday shares were pushed up by index-related buying on the part of investment trusts as well as small orders from individuals and corporations traders said .
Institutions meanwhile stepped back to the sidelines as the direction of U.S. interest rates remained unclear .
The uncertainty was multiplied by the persistent strength of the dollar traders said and by the U.S. trade deficit which widened by 31 % in August from the previous month .
Traders and analysts said they did n't see any effect on Tokyo stocks from the California earthquake .
The impact on Japanese insurers and property owners with interests in the San Francisco area is still being assessed they said .
Buying was scattered across a wide range of issues making the session fairly characterless traders said .
With uncertainty still hanging over interest rates and the dollar the market failed to find a focus that might lead to further investor commitments they said .
Some traders said the popularity of issues that gained yesterday wo n't last long as investors will rotate their buying choices over the short term .
Interest rate-sensitive shares such as steel construction and electric utility companies which rose early in the week saw their advance weaken yesterday .
Traders said these issues need large-volume buying to push up their prices so substantial gains are n't likely unless institutional investors participate .
An outstanding issue in yesterday 's session was Mitsubishi Rayon which surged 95 to 905 yen 6.34 a share .
Its popularity was due to speculation about the strong earnings potential of a new type of plastic wrap for household use a trader at County Natwest Securities Japan said .
Some laggard food issues attracted bargain-hunters traders said .
Kirin Brewery was up 100 at 2,000 and Ajinomoto gained 70 to 2,840 .

Housing construction sank in September to its lowest level since the last recession the Commerce Department reported .
Work began on homes and apartments at an annual rate of 1,263,000 units last month down 5.2 % from August the department said .
The September decline followed an even steeper drop of 6.2 % in August and left housing starts at their weakest since October 1982 when the country was nearing the end of a recession .
Originally the department had reported the August decline as 5 % .
The numbers suggest that the housing industry is still suffering the effects of the Federal Reserve 's battle against inflation .
The industry had shown signs of recovery this summer after the central bank began to relax its clamp on credit allowing interest rates to drop a bit after pushing them up for a year .
Sales of new homes rose and inventories of houses which had been climbing dropped .
But last month new construction in all types of homes waned from single-family houses to large apartment complexes .
It 's pretty much weak across the board said Martin Regalia chief economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions .
Mr. Regalia said the industry may be reluctant to step up building at the moment for fear the inventories of unsold homes will increase again .
Another reason for the weakness he said may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in March .
In August rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages started creeping up a bit but they inched down again through September .
Rates have n't really peeled off that much Mr. Regalia said .
We 've kind of settled now into an interest-rate environment that 's fairly high .
Work was begun on single family homes the core of the housing market at an annual rate of 971,000 in September a drop of 2.1 % from the previous month .
That followed a 3.3 % decline in August .
Construction of apartments and other multi-family dwellings slipped 2.2 % to an annual rate of 1,022,000 following a 3.5 % decline in August .
The number of building permits issued for future construction dropped 2.4 % to a 1,296,000 annual rate after rising 3.7 % in August .
All the numbers were adjusted for normal seasonal variations in building activity .
The housing starts numbers however are one of the least precise of the government 's economic indicators and are often revised significantly as more information is collected .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. posted a sharp third-quarter turnaround from a year earlier but net income would have dropped from the second quarter without a 37 million after-tax gain .
The securities firm posted third-quarter net of 66 million or 64 cents a share compared with a restated year-earlier loss of 3 million or 11 cents a share .
Revenue climbed 25 % to 3.3 billion from 2.6 billion .
The latest period included the gain which was 77 million before tax from the previously announced sale of the institutional money management business of Lehman Management Co .
The 1988 period was restated from net income of 8 million to correct an overstatement in the company 's Boston Co. subsidiary .
In the 1989 second quarter Shearson had net income of 55 million or 54 cents a share .
An average 102.5 million common shares were outstanding in the latest quarter up from 87.1 million .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Shearson shares lost 37.5 cents to 18.125 .
The company said the improved performance from a year ago reflects higher commissions and revenue from marketmaking and trading for its own account .
Commission revenue was 522 million up 49 % .
But industrywide trading activity slowed in September as institutional investors turned cautious and individuals continued to shy away from the market .
Investment banking revenue fell 32 % to 205 million in part reflecting the continued slowdown of the underwriting business .

Revenue advanced 26 % to 9.6 billion from 7.6 billion .
Two major drug companies posted strong third-quarter earnings in line with profits already reported by industry leaders and analysts ' expectations .
But Pfizer Inc. based in New York reported flat earnings .
Schering-Plough Corp. based in Madison N.J. reported a 21 % rise in earnings as American Home Products Corp. of New York posted an 11 % increase in net .
American Home Products American Home Products said sales and earnings for the third quarter and nine months were at record levels .
Sales for the third quarter increased 6.5 % to 1.51 billion from 1.42 billion .

It is quite unfortunate that you failed so miserably in reporting the Hurricane Hugo disaster .
Your Sept. 27 page-one article Charleston Lost Quite a Lot to Hugo Especially Gentility leaves the impression that the storm was little more than an inconvenience .
The damage reported focused on a select few who owned irreplaceable historic homes on the Battery .
Not mentioned were the 50,000 people rendered homeless and the more than 200,000 out of work for an indeterminable period the 1 billion-plus in losses to homes and personal property on the barrier islands the near and long-term impact on the state 's largest industry tourism not to mention the human suffering .
In centering on the disruption of a few proud local customs such as the historic homes tour and the damage to the antiquities your reporter served to only perpetuate an outdated and stereotypically provincial view of this otherwise thriving port city .
The damage will undoubtedly prove to be one of the epic human and economic disasters of the decade in this country .

Your story was tasteless and insensitive .
Depicting the people of a traumatized city reeling from a disaster of unprecedented proportions was at the very best ludicrous under the circumstances .
Your narrow focus appears to be a contrived attempt to show the people of that historic city to be doddering fools .
You had to have been blind not to see the scenario there for what it was and is and will continue to be for months and even years a part of South Carolina that has sustained a blow that the Red Cross expects will cost that organization alone some 38 million .

Charleston is historic and aristocratic as your reporter said but not haughty as he suggested .
Charlestonians are instead indomitable and have contributed mightily to the culture and history of our country for more than 300 years .
I suggest your reporter see Charleston next spring in its full glory .

Affiliated Bankshares of Colorado Inc. said it agreed to sell its 10 % interest in Rocky Mountain Bankcard Systems for 18.5 million to Colorado National Bank of Denver and Central Bank of Denver .
Colorado National is a unit of Colorado National Bankshares Inc. and Central is a unit of First Bank System of Minneapolis .
Affiliated said it expects to record a pretax gain of about 18.5 million from the sale of the credit-card business which should more than offset any reduction in the carrying value of real estate and real-estate loans on its books .
The U.S. Export-Import Bank tentatively decided to guarantee commercial bank financing for the purchase of two Boeing Co. 767 airliners by Avianca Colombia 's international airline at a cost of about 150 million .
The loan guarantee would amount to about 127.5 million or 85 % of the cost of the aircraft .
Because of the size of the proposed loan guarantee the Ex-Im Bank 's preliminary commitment is subject to review by the House and Senate Banking committees .
Ex-Im Bank officials said this review process currently is under way .
Sebastian Guzman Cabrera took over the oil workers union Mexico 's most powerful labor organization only last January .
But even in that short time Mr. Guzman Cabrera has become as controversial in his own way as his deposed predecessor Joaquin Hernandez Galicia known as La Quina .
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari used the army to oust La Quina who reigned for 28 years over a graft-riddled empire that made state-run Petroleos Mexicanos or Pemex one of the world 's most inefficient oil companies .
Now Mr. Guzman Cabrera is facing accusations that he 's as much a company man as La Quina was a crook .
In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union 's role in subcontracting long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings .
And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment .
Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's new order has n't arrived without resistance .
Brawls between union factions still erupt at Pemex installations .
Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas publicly questioned Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's moral quality suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country 's oil a symbol of Mexican nationalism to foreigners .
The 61-year-old Mr. Guzman Cabrera takes such criticisms in stride .
This is n't a new kind of union leadership it 's a new Mexico .
We 're no longer afraid of associating with private or foreign capital he says .
Pemex which produces 40 % of government revenue desperately needs new investment .
Since world oil prices collapsed in 1982 the government has siphoned Pemex 's coffers to make payments on Mexico 's 97 billion foreign debt .
Little money has been returned to upgrade Pemex 's aging facilities .
While the government drains Pemex from above the union has drained it from below .
A bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused Pemex 's operating costs to balloon to 95 cents of each 1 in sales far above the industry norm .
The declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why Mexico has been importing gasoline this year .
Some projections show Mexico importing crude by the end of the century barring an overhaul of operations .
Whatever you tried to change whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners the big obstacle was the old union leadership says oil consultant George Baker .
Enter Mr. Guzman Cabrera who has a clear understanding of where union leaders fit in the pro-enterprise regime of President Salinas .
I 'm the secretary-general if there is one he says greeting a visitor to his office .
Beginning as a laborer in a refinery Mr. Guzman Cabrera put in more than 40 years at Pemex before being pushed into retirement by La Quina after a dispute two years ago .
Though he also long benefited from the system built by La Quina Mr. Guzman Cabrera says union perks had simply gotten out of hand .
They are at the base of all of the problems of corruption he says .
Thus in recent contract negotiations Mr. Guzman Cabrera gave up the union 's right to assign 40 % of all of Pemex 's outside contracts an enormous source of kickbacks .
The union also ceded the 2 % commission it had received on all Pemex maintenance contracts .
The union will keep a 2 % commission on construction projects .
The new contract also eliminates the 15 monthly coupon good only at union-owned grocery stores that was part of the salary of every worker from roughneck to chief executive .
About 9,800 technical workers notably chemists and lawyers were switched to non-union status .
Also because of its reduced capital budget Pemex has phased out about 50,000 transitory construction workers reducing the work force to about 140,000 the union leader says .
Mr. Guzman Cabrera says the union 's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22 % increase in compensation .
But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract .
We are retaking the instruments of administration says Raul Robles a Pemex subdirector .
Pemex officials would n't say how much money the new contract would save the company but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around 500 million a year .
Pemex 's customers also are pleased with the company 's new spirit .
Grupo Desc a big conglomerate has long depended on Pemex petrochemicals to produce plastic packing material .
But when the Pemex plant shut down for an annual overhaul it would never give notice to its customers .
The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations says Ernesto Vega Velasco Desc 's finance director .
This year for the first time Desc and other customers were consulted well in advance of the Pemex plant 's shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience .
Taming the union complements previous moves by the government to attract private investment in petrochemicals which Mexico has been forced to import in large quantities in recent years .
In May the government unveiled new foreign investment regulations that create special trusts allowing foreigners long limited to a 40 % stake in secondary petrochemical companies to own up to 100 % .
Later the government reclassified several basic petrochemicals as secondary products .
But Pemex 's courtship with private companies and especially foreign ones is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938 .
They are preparing the workers for what 's coming foreign control wrote Heberto Castillo a leftist leader .
Mr. Guzman Cabrera and government officials insist that foreigners will be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products .
But the new union leader makes no apologies for Pemex 's more outward-looking attitude .
If we do not integrate into this new world of interdependence sooner or later we 're going to become victims of our own isolation he says .
Couple Counseling Grows to Defuse Stress MORE EXECUTIVES and their spouses are seeking counseling as work and family pressures mount .
Some employers initiate referrals especially if work problems threaten a top manager 's job .
Many couples are like ships passing in the night a communications gulf that sparks problems on the job and at home says psychologist Harry Levinson .
His Levinson Institute in Belmont Mass. has seen in recent years a doubling in the number of executives and spouses at its weeklong counseling program .
Employers foot the bill he says figuring what 's good for the couple is good for the company .
One East Coast manufacturing executive faced with a job transfer his wife resented found that counseling helped them both come to grips with the move .
And the vice president of a large Midwestern company realized that an abrasive temperament threatened his career when his wife confided that similar behavior at home harmed their marriage .
More dual-career couples also are getting help with men increasingly bringing their working wives for joint counseling .
The level of stress for a woman is often so high it 's the husband who says I 'm worried about her says psychologist Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz .
Her Institute for Family and Work Relationships in La Jolla Calif. has noted a doubling in the number of couples seeking help the past two years .
No matter how competent and smart you both are the relationship almost certainly will erode if you do n't have time to talk to have fun and to be sexual says Ms. Shaevitz .
She urges client couples to begin a detoxification period purging social and other nonproductive activities and setting time apart for themselves .
Putting those times on the calendar she says is as important as remembering business appointments .
Power of Suggestion Stronger in Japan HERE 'S ONE more explanation for why Japan is a tough industrial competitor Two of three Japanese employees submit suggestions to save money increase efficiency and boost morale while only 8 % of American workers do .
And the Japanese make far more suggestions 2,472 per 100 eligible employees vs. only 13 per 100 employees in the Data for 1987 from the National Association of Suggestion Systems and the Japan Human Relations Association also indicate that Japanese employers adopt four of five suggestions while their U.S. counterparts accept just one in four .
In Japan small suggestions are encouraged .
Each new employee is expected to submit four daily in the first few months on the job .
U.S. companies tend to favor suggestions that go for the home runs says Gary Floss vice president of corporate quality at Control Data Corp .
That helps explain why American employers grant an average award of 604.72 per suggestion while Japan 's payment is 3.23 .
Still suggestions ' net savings per 100 employees is 274,475 in Japan vs. 24,891 in the U.S. .
U.S. companies developing management teams are wrestling with how to handle individual suggestion systems .
Control Data for one plays down its employee suggestion program because it favors the team-management focus .
