en at least a year to rise a modest 3 % to 5 % over last year 's totals both for his company and the industry in general .
I 'm not looking for a runaway Christmas at all he says .
It is n't a real boom holiday season in our eyes says Woolworth Corp. Chairman Harold E. Sells but it is n't going to be a bust either .
Mr. Sells expects fourth-quarter sales at his company which besides Woolworth stores includes Kinney and Foot Locker shoe stores and other specialty chains to rise pretty much in line with its year-to-date increases of between 8 % and 9 % .
The estimate includes the results of new stores .
A consumer poll conducted in early September by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates a market researcher based in Chicago also suggests a modest holiday .
Of the 450 survey respondents 35 % said they expect to spend less buying Christmas gifts this year than last year while 28 % said they expect to spend more and 37 % said their gift budget would stay the same .
The results are almost identical to Shapiro 's September 1988 numbers .
Retailers could get a boost this year from the calendar .
Christmas falls on a Monday creating a big last-minute weekend opportunity for stores .
Most will stay open late Saturday night and open their doors again Sunday .
But many consumers probably will use the extra time to put off some purchasing until the last minute .
What you 'll hear as we get into December is that sales are sluggish predicts Woolworth 's Mr. Sells .
The week ending the 24th is going to save the entire month for everyone .
The Spanish author Camilo Jose Cela won the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday a surprising choice but given the Swedish Academy 's past perversities hardly the most undeserved and ridiculous accolade handed out by the awarding committee .
In Spain anyway the 73-year-old Mr. Cela enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books he wrote during the parched Franco years the everyday poverty and stagnant atmosphere of which he described in brutally direct vivid prose beginning with The Family of Pascal Duarte 1942 .
Unlike other writers who either battled the fascists during the Civil War or left Spain when Franco triumphed Mr. Cela fought briefly on the general 's side no doubt earning with his war wound some forbearance when he went on to depict a country with a high population of vagabonds murderers and rural idiots trudging aimlessly through a dried-out land .
Still it was in Argentine editions that his countrymen first read his story of Pascal Duarte a field worker who stabbed his mother to death and has no regrets as he awaits his end in a prison cell Fate directs some men down the flower-bordered path and others down the road bordered with thistles and prickly pears .
The lucky ones gaze out at life with serene eyes and smile with a face of innocence at their perfumed happiness .
The others endure the hot sun of the plains and scowl like cornered wild beasts .
Mr. Cela himself was one of the lucky ones his fortunes steadily increasing over the decades he spent putting out some 70 travelogues novels short story collections and poetry .
These days he is as known for his flamboyant tastes and the youthful muse who shares his life as he is for his books .
The man who wore out his shoes wandering around Guadalajara in 1958 describing in his travel book Viaje a la Alcarria how he scrounged for food and stayed in squalid inns now tours Spain in a Rolls-Royce .
Of his 10 novels The Hive 1951 full of sharp vignettes of Madrid life and centered on a cafe run by Dona Rosa a foul-mouthed broad-based woman with blackened little teeth encrusted in filth used to be available in English translated by J.M. Cohen and published by Ecco Press which now no doubt regrets relinquishing its copyright .
Here is an excerpt The lonely woman walks on in the direction of the Plaza de Alonso Martinez .
Two men have a conversation behind one of the windows of the cafe on the corner of the boulevard .
Both are young one twenty odd the other thirty odd .
The older one looks like a member of the jury for a literary award the younger one looks like a novelist .
It is evident that their conversation runs more or less on the following lines I 've submitted the manuscript of my novel under the title Teresa de Cepeda ' and in it I 've treated a few neglected aspects of that eternal problem which Oh yes .
Will you pour me a drop of water if you do n't mind .
With pleasure .
I 've revised it several times and I think I may say with pride that there is not a single discordant word in the whole text .
How interesting .
I think so .
I do n't know the quality of the works my colleagues have sent in but in any case I feel confident that good sense and honest judgment Rest assured we proceed with exemplary fairness .
I do n't doubt it for a moment .
It does not matter if one is defeated provided the work that gets the award has unmistakable qualities .
What 's so discouraging is In passing the window Senorita Elvira gives them a smile simply out of habit .
Ashland Oil Inc. said it will take after-tax charges of 78 million or 1.40 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .
Because of the charge Ashland expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and significantly lower results for fiscal 1989 .
The oil refiner said it will report fiscal fourth quarter and 1989 results next week .
The company earned 66 million or 1.19 a share on revenue of 2.1 billion in the year-ago fourth quarter .
For fiscal 1988 Ashland had net of 224 million or 4.01 a share on revenue of 7.8 billion .
Both revenue figures exclude excise taxes .
The charges consist of a 25 million after-tax charge to cover cost overruns in Ashland 's Riley Consolidated subsidiary a previously announced 38 million after-tax charge resulting from a 325 million settlement with National Iranian Oil Co. and a 15 million after-tax charge from the previously announced sale of its Ashland Technology Corp. subsidiary .
Ashland expects that sale to be complete next year .
The charge for the Riley subsidiary is for expected costs to correct problems with certain bed boilers built for utilities .
The charge will be added to 20 million in reserves established a year ago to cover the cost overruns .
When President Bush arrives here next week for a hemispheric summit organized to commemorate a century of Costa Rican democracy will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the Panamanian fiasco .
Undoubtedly Mr. Bush will be praised by some Latin leaders prone to pay lip service to nonintervention while they privately encourage more assertive U.S. action to remove Gen. Manuel Noriega and safeguard their countries from a Sandinista onslaught .
The Panamanian affair is only the tip of a more alarming iceberg .
It originates in a Bush administration decision not to antagonize the U.S. Congress and avoid at all costs being accused of meddling in the region .
The result has been a dangerous vacuum of U.S. leadership which leaves Central America open to Soviet adventurism .
The influence of the U.S. is not being felt in Central America Washington 's decisions do not respond to a policy and are divorced from reality says Fernando Volio a Costa Rican congressman and former foreign minister .
The disarray of the Bush administration 's Latin diplomacy was evident in the failure of the Organization of American States to condemn categorically Gen. Noriega .
Faced with this embarrassment U.S. diplomats expressed confidence that the influential Rio Group of South American nations which gathered last week in Peru would take a stronger posture toward the Panamanian dictator .
But other than a few slaps on the wrist Gen. Noriega went unpunished by that body too he was not even singled out in the closing statement .
Now Mr. Bush will come to Costa Rica and encounter Nicaraguan strongman Daniel Ortega eager for photo opportunities with the U.S. president .
The host Costa Rican President Oscar Arias did not invite Chile Cuba Panama or Haiti to the summit which was to be restricted to democracies .
However Mr. Ortega was included .
Formally upgrading the Sandinistas to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized in the Costa Rican press .
Even Carlos Manuel Castillo the presidential candidate for Mr. Arias 's National Liberation Party made public his opposition to the presence of Nicaragua in a democratic festivity .
Nevertheless the Bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in July a few weeks before the Central American presidents met in Tela Honduras to discuss a timetable for disbanding the anti-Sandinista rebels .
According to officials in Washington the State Department hoped that by pleasing President Arias it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the Contras until after Mr. Ortega 's promises of democratic elections were tested next February .
However relying on an ardent critic of the Reagan administration and the Contra movement for help in delaying the disarming of the Contras was risky business .
And even some last-minute phone calls that Mr. Bush made at the behest of some conservative U.S. senators to enlist backing for the U.S. position failed to stop the march of Mr. Arias 's agenda .
Prior to this episode Sen. Christopher Dodd D. Conn. sensing an open field undertook a personal diplomatic mission through Central America to promote an early disbanding of the rebels .
Visiting Nicaragua he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral system and chided the Bush administration for not rewarding the Sandinistas .
In Honduras where the Contras are a hot political issue he promised to help unblock some 70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with Washington .
Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani Mr. Cristiani 's government is very much at the mercy of U.S. largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. Dodd 's likes and dislikes .
It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the U.S. virtually neglected by the Bush administration ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by December long before the elections .
Fittingly the Tela Accords were nicknamed by Hondurans the Dodd plan .
The individual foreign policy carried out by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in Central America .
On Oct. 3 following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim Nicaragua 's great peace efforts .
There Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America .
He also called on Nicaragua 's neighbors to accept a military equilibrium guaranteed by both superpowers .
The Pentagon claims that in spite of Moscow 's words East bloc weapons continue to flow into Nicaragua through Cuba at near-record levels .
Since Mr. Shevardnadze 's proposals followed discussions with Mr. Baker speculations arose that the Bush administration was seeking an accommodation with the Soviets in Central America .
This scheme would fit the Arias Plan which declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the Sandinista dictatorship and that provided by Washington to freely elected governments .
Furthermore it is also likely to encourage those on Capitol Hill asking for cuts in the assistance to El Salvador if President Cristiani does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas .
The sad condition of U.S. policy in Central America is best depicted by the recent end to U.S. sponsorship of Radio Costa Rica .
In 1984 the Costa Rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country flooded by airwaves of Sandinista propaganda .
Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of Radio Costa Rica funded by the U.S. and affiliated with the Voice of America VOA .
A few months ago the Bush administration decided to stop this cooperation leaving Radio Costa Rica operating on a shoestring .
According to news reports the abrupt termination was due to fears that VOA transmissions could interfere with the peace process .
In the meantime Russia gave Nicaragua another powerful radio transmitter which has been installed in the city of Esteli .
It is capable of reaching the entire Caribbean area and deep into North America .
Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the Soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to U.S. default .
The Soviet entrenchment in Nicaragua is alarming for Costa Rica a peaceful democracy without an army .
Questioned in Washington about what would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail President Arias voiced expectations of direct U.S. action .
A poll conducted in July by a Gallup affiliate showed that 64 % of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either Nicaragua or Panama the U.S. will come to its defense .
But in the light of events in Panama where the U.S. has such clear strategic interests waiting for the Delta Force may prove to be a dangerous gambit .

Holiday Corp. said net income jumped 89 % partly on the strength of record operating income in its gaming division .
Separately the hotel and gambling giant said it was proceeding with plans to make a tender offer and solicit consents with respect to approximately 1.4 billion of its publicly traded debt .
That debt is part of the 2.1 billion of Holiday debt that Bass PLC of Britain said it would retire or assume when it agreed to buy the Holiday Inn business in August .
Holiday said third-quarter earnings rose to 39.8 million or 1.53 a share from 21 million or 84 cents a share a year earlier .
Results for the quarter included 19.2 million in pretax gains from property transactions including the sale of one Embassy Suites hotel and 3.5 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the acquisition of the Holiday Inn business by Bass .
Holiday said operating income related to gaming increased 4.5 % to a record 61.4 million from 58.8 million a year earlier .
The jump reflected record results in Las Vegas Nev. and Atlantic City N.J. as well as a full quarter 's results from Harrah 's Del Rio in Laughlin Nev .
Third-quarter revenue rose 2.7 % to 433.5 million from 422.1 million .
For the nine months earnings fell 2.9 % to 99.1 million or 3.86 a share from 102.1 million or 4.10 a share a year earlier .
Revenue dropped 1.6 % to 1.21 billion from 1.23 billion .
The tender offer and consent solicitation will be made to debtholders in December .
In effect Holiday is asking holders for permission for Bass to buy their debt .
Holiday said Salomon Brothers Inc. has been retained to act as the dealer-manager and financial adviser in connection with the offer and solicitation .
The debt issues involved and the proposed consent fees and cash tender offer prices expressed per 1,000 of principal amount are as follows 10 1\/2 % senior notes due 1994 at 101 % 11 % subordinated debt due 1999 at 102 % 9 3\/8 % notes due 1993 at 100 % and 8 3\/8 % notes due 1996 at 95.25 % .
Holiday said its 15 % notes due 1992 also will be included in the tender offer and consent solicitation at a price to be determined by Holiday prior to the commencement of the offer .
The television units of Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. are exploring the possibility of offering prime-time programming to independent stations two nights a week industry executives say .
Although such a venture would n't match the fourth network created by News Corp. 's Fox Broadcasting Co. MCA and Paramount may have similar ambitions .
Fox which also owns six TV stations provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates .
Paramount Domestic TV and MCA TV formed a joint venture last month named Premier Advertiser Sales to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies such as Star Trek the Next Generation Charles in Charge and Friday the 13th the Series .
A spokeswoman for Paramount said the company does n't comment on speculation .
Calls to Shelly Schwab president of MCA TV were n't returned .
The two companies like Fox already have their own TV stations .
MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed to purchase a 79 % stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued at 140 million .
TVX owns five stations including WTXF a Fox affiliate in Philadelphia .
One broadcasting executive familiar with the project said the co-venture would target stations affiliated with Fox because Fox has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities .
Currently Fox supplies programs on Saturdays Sundays and Mondays although the company plans to expand to other weeknights .
Jamie Kellner president of Fox Broadcasting said We believe the partnership of Fox its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow .
Another Fox official who declined to be identified said Fox was n't pleased by the possible Paramount-MCA venture into prime-time programming .
To make the venture work they would need Fox affiliates he said .
We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations he said adding that Fox does n't appreciate another company attempting to usurp its station lineup .
Fox said it plans to offer its stations movies theatrical and made-for-TV ventures probably on Wednesdays sometime next year .
It is also planning another night of original series .
Paramount and MCA according to the broadcasting executive plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by Paramount and MCA for Wednesdays and perhaps a block of original shows Fridays .
The executive said Paramount and MCA have also held discussions with Chris-Craft Industries ' broadcasting unit which owns five independent stations in cities such as Los Angeles San Francisco and Portland Ore .
A Chris-Craft station manager said there have been no formal talks .
I think it 's to Fox 's advantage to be associated with the Paramount-MCA venture said Michael Conway station manager of WTXF the TVX station that is a Fox affiliate .
Mr. Conway said the Fox shows appearing on nights when Paramount-MCA shows would n't be offered could be promoted on the programs produced by Paramount-MCA .
Michael Fisher general manager of KTXL a Fox affiliate in Sacramento Calif. said The real question is whether the Paramount-MCA offering is practical .
It is n't .
Why would I consider giving up Fox a proven commodity for an unknown venture .
Fox attracts a young audience with shows such as Married With Children its most successful series .
Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and BanPonce Corp. agreed to merge in a transaction valued at 324 million .
Under the agreement BanPonce stockholders will be able to exchange each of their shares for either shares in the new entity or cash .
In each case the exchange is valued at 56.25 a share .
The two companies both based in San Juan will form a bank holding company with assets of just over 9 billion .
The holding company will be called BanPonce Corp .
The primary subsidiary will be the combined banking operations of the two companies and will be known as Banco Popular de Puerto Rico .
Rafael Carrion Jr. chairman of Banco Popular will be the chairman of the holding company .
Alberto M. Paracchini currently chairman of BanPonce will serve as president of the bank holding company and chairman of the subsidiary .
Banco Popular originally proposed the merger in July in a cash and stock transaction valued at 50 a share or about 293 million .
BanPonce reacted cooly at first but appeared to be won over analysts said by Banco Popular 's assurances that it wanted only a friendly transaction .
Banco Popular just kept waiting said Edward Thompson a vice president and analyst at Thomson BankWatch Inc. in New York .
They got a transaction that 's good for both companies .
The two banks appear to be a good fit .
BanPonce caters to a more affluent customer while Banco Popular has always had a large presence among middle-income and lower-income markets .
The merger should also allow the companies to reduce costs by combining operations in many locations in Puerto Rico .
They 're often right across the street from one another Mr. Thompson said .
Richard Carrion who is currently president and chief executive officer of Banco Popular said the merger will result in a larger and stronger locally based bank .
Mr. Carrion who will now serve as president and chief executive officer of the subsidiary bank added We 'll be able to better compete with large foreign banks .
It makes sense from a strategic standpoint .
The newly merged company will have 165 branches in Puerto Rico and 27 branches outside of the island .
The banks said they do n't expect the merger to face any regulatory hurdles .
Mr. Carrion said the merger should be completed in six to nine months .
Hit by higher costs and lower sales Caterpillar Inc. said third-quarter earnings tumbled 43 % and full-year earnings will trail last year 's results .
The construction equipment maker said third-quarter profit fell to 108 million or 1.07 a share from 190 million or 1.87 a share a year earlier .
Sales dropped 6 % to 2.58 billion from 2.74 billion reflecting eight fewer business days in the latest quarter .
The company which is in a costly modernization program said earnings were hurt by higher start-up and new program costs increased costs of materials higher wages and an 11 million provision for bad debts in Latin America .
In announcing a 1989 capital spending plan of 950 million early this year Caterpillar said full-year earnings would be flat compared with last year 's 616 million or 6.07 a share .
But yesterday the company said this year 's profit will be lower .
It did n't say by how much .
Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production that cut orders for its engines Caterpillar also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the Peoria area and temporarily shut its plant in York Pa. for two weeks in both November and December .
For the first nine months of the year Caterpillar said earnings fell 14 % to 390 million or 3.85 a share from 453 million or 4.46 a share a year earlier .
Sales rose to 8.19 billion from 7.65 billion .
Millicom Inc. said it is one of two companies to receive a license to introduce and operate a cellular mobile telephone system in Pakistan .
The market during the start-up is estimated at 25,000 subscribers .
A spokeswoman for Millicom a telecommunications company said she did n't know the value of the contract .
Cable & Wireless PLC of Britain won the other license .
Millicom said it would build and operate the system in Pakistan with Comvik International AB part of the Kinnevik group of Sweden and Arfeen International Pakistan .
B.A.T Industries PLC won overwhelming shareholder approval for a defensive restructuring to fend off a 13.35 billion 21.23 billion takeover bid from Sir James Goldsmith .
At a shareholders ' meeting in London the tobacco financial-services and retailing giant said it received 99.9 % approval from voting holders for plans to spin off about 6 billion in assets .
B.A.T aims to sell such U.S. retailing units as Marshall Field and Saks Fifth Avenue and float its big paper and British retailing businesses via share issues to existing holders .
Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10 % or about 153 million of its shares and a 50 % dividend increase .
B.A.T yesterday started its share buy-back .
The company said it acquired 2.5 million shares for 785 pence 12.48 each or a total of 19.6 million 31.2 million from its broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd .
The share buy-back plan is likely to underpin B.A.T 's share price .
B.A.T said it may make more equity purchases until the close of business today depending on market conditions but will cease further purchases until Nov. 22 when it releases third-quarter results .
B.A.T shares rose 29 pence to 783 pence on London 's stock exchange yesterday .
Shareholder approval sets the stage for a lengthy process of restructuring that might not be completed until next year 's second half .
Before the recent tumult in global financial markets B.A.T officials holders and analysts had expected a substantial part of the restructuring to be complete by the end of the first half .
We are not in any hurry to sell Saks Marshall Field or B.A.T 's other U.S. retail properties said Chairman Patrick Sheehy .
This is n't a distress sale .
We are determined to get good prices .
Company officials say the flotations of the paper and British retailing businesses are likely only after the disposals of the U.S. retailing assets .
Meanwhile Sir James still is pursuing efforts to gain U.S. insurance regulators ' approval for a change in control of B.A.T 's Farmers Group Inc. unit .
The Anglo-French financier has indicated he intends to bid again for B.A.T if he receives approval .
Hasbro Inc. the nation 's largest toy maker reported third-quarter earnings increased 73 % from a year earlier on a 9.4 % sales gain reflecting improved margins .
Hasbro said it had net income of 31.3 million or 53 cents a share up from 18.1 million or 31 cents a share a year earlier when it took a pretax charge of 10 million after dropping development of an interactive video entertainment system .
Revenue rose to 403 million from 368.4 million .
The company cited sales gains at its Milton Bradley and Playskool units and in its international business for the increase in revenue .
Alan G. Hassenfeld chairman and chief executive added that Hasbro 's new line of battery-powered racing cars called Record Breakers and its acquisition of Cabbage Patch Kids Scrabble and other lines from Coleco Industries Inc. puts the company in a good position as we enter the Christmas buying season .
For the first nine months of the year Hasbro 's net income rose 33 % to 68.2 million or 1.15 a share from 51.3 million or 88 cents a share on a 3.1 % increase in revenue to 992.7 million from 963 million a year earlier .
Reebok International Ltd. posted a 35 % increase in third-quarter net income despite a slight decline in sales .
The athletic footwear maker said net rose to 49.9 million or 44 cents a share from 37.1 million or 32 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales declined 3 % to 524.5 million from 539.4 million .
Paul Fireman Reebok chairman and chief executive officer said Our gains in earnings provide further evidence that the controls we have put in place and our sales mix are continuing to improve the company 's overall profit performance .
The company said it expects sales to improve due to a number of new products including a pump basketball shoe that can be inflated to better fit the foot .
In the first nine months net was 140 million or 1.23 a share on sales of 1.44 billion .
Separately Reebok completed the acquisition of CML Group Inc. 's Boston Whaler unit a builder of power boats .
CML Acton Mass. had agreed to sell the unit to Reebok for about 42 million .
The agreement also called for Reebok to receive warrants to purchase 400,000 shares of CML common at 31.25 a share exercisable at any time before July 1 An outside spokesman for CML said the terms were changed to a minor extent but would n't disclose what those changes were .
Pitney Bowes Inc. directors authorized the company to seek buyers for its Wheeler Group Inc. subsidiary a direct mail marketer of office supplies .
Pitney Bowes said the decision was based on a long-term analysis of the compatibility of Wheeler Group 's marketing business with other Pitney Bowes operations .
Pitney Bowes acquired the core of what evolved into Wheeler Group in 1979 by buying Dictaphone Corp .
A spokeswoman would n't comment on whether the company had talked with any potential buyers for the New Hartford Conn. unit which had 1988 sales of about 75 million .
She said Wheeler Group was profitable but would n't give figures .
The spokeswoman said the company does n't have a timetable for the sale adding that the board 's decision just starts the search for a buyer .
Separately Pitney Bowes said third-quarter net income gained 15 % to 62 million or 78 cents a share from 54 million or 68 cents a share a year ago .
Revenue grew 13 % to 734.8 million from 650.9 million .
The company said the growth was led by its major operations particularly mailing shipping dictating and facsimile businesses .
Steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the Nimitz Freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the double-decker highway last year by California 's Department of Transportation employees familiar with the project say .
The test project which reportedly survived Tuesday 's earthquake was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings .
State engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed that was responsible for the collapse .
The failure in Oakland of the freeway segment known as the Cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared .
Sorting out the wreckage is expected to take several days .
Red tractors gingerly picked at the rubble while jackhammers tried to break up some of the massive slabs of concrete .
Giant yellow cranes were wheeled up alongside the collapsed segment preparing to lift off chunks of the debris .
In Sacramento a transportation department spokesman said he could n't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work .
However he asserted that the depart
