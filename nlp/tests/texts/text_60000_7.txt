 was an issue of death-backed bonds securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders .
Some predict there will be Third World bonds backed by loans to Brazil Argentina and other debt-ridden nations .
And the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables sometimes known as plastic bonds .
This is the heyday of debt says James Grant editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer a newsletter .
Before the sun sets on the '80s it seems nothing will be left unhocked .
The result is a 45 billion market according to Securities Data Co .
That includes more than 9.5 billion issued through August of this year up sharply from 6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period and more than in all of 1987 .
Most issues have been sold to professional money managers pension funds bank trust departments and other institutions .
But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market .
The entry fee is affordable Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of 1,000 .
We expect additional offerings of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors says Bill Addiss a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
The process typically begins when an institution such as Citibank or Sears Roebuck & Co. takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust .
The trust then issues securities generally due in five years or less that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors .
Issues typically come with credit enhancements such as a bank letter of credit and thus have received high credit ratings .
Enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions .
Asset-backed securities are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds says Craig J. Goldberg managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
But skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks .
Consider a 500 million offering of 9 % securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables .
The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues .
On a 10,000 investment that 's a difference of only 50 a year .
That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street .
But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have that margin is meaningless .
If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby then even an extra 25 basis points 0.25 percentage point becomes an important consideration on a career basis says Mr. Grant .
But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again then that is n't of overwhelming importance .
Moreover the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level .
That 's why some investment managers such as Alex Powers a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states such as New York or California .
But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts such as retirement plans .
He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts .
Another concern is liquidity or how easily a security can be converted into cash .
The secondary or resale market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues .
That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature .
That 's particularly true analysts say for certain of the securities such as those backed by time-share loans .
You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market says Jonathan S. Paris a vice president of European Investors Inc. a New York investment-management firm .
In addition an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange can simply check newspaper listings .
There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities .
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem .
Investors for instance may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities .
It is n't .
The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks Citibank N.A. Citicorp or any affiliate thereof .
In other words if there 's a problem do n't expect Citibank to come to the rescue .
The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency .
That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received .
That also is n't easy .
Take the credit enhancements which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company .
The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities .
Nor does it cover the entire portfolio .
Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue .
Still they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim .
But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper .
When you buy an asset-backed issue you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties .
If a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of say its loans to Third World nations that could also affect the ratings liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports .
Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions .
But despite the credit enhancements despite the high ratings some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets .
At a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times .
At the very least a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find that is Treasurys .
That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities as well as make it tougher to unload the latter .
But it could be much worse .
Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues .
For one thing credit-card loans are unsecured .
In addition they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession .
A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds says Craig Corcoran of Davis\/Zweig Futures Inc. an investment advisory firm .
What about triple-A-rated asset-backed issues .
Nope we still say to stick with Treasurys Mr. Corcoran replies .
Ratings he notes are subject to change .
All this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people .
And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. of what he calls DeVoe 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1 More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations scams and frauds of all time .

IF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence it would probably be a one-word sentence Diversify .
Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc. serious investors have taken that advice to heart .
Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal 's poll providing an in-depth look at their portfolios .
Those portfolios are remarkably diversified .
By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area be it stocks bonds or real estate .
For example about 88 % of Journal readers owned stock down slightly from 91 % in a similar poll last year .
But only 17.5 % said they had more than half their money in the stock market .
Similarly 57 % of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund and 33 % own municipal bonds .
But only 6 % to 7 % of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives .
The poll conducted Aug. 7-28 also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics .
It found them in a cautious but not downbeat mood .
Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire 951 replied .
The response rate more than 63 % allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence .
The results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors though .
Journal readers are relatively affluent with a median household income of between 75,000 and 99,000 .
Nearly half of the respondents 47 % said their investment portfolio was worth 250,000 or more and 17 % said it was worth 1 million or more .
The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago .
For example 12 % of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months .
Last year only 8 % were expecting a recession .
An additional 56 % of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months .
Only 42 % of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth .
Apparently the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much .
A slim majority 51 % think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989 .
Their verdict on real estate is almost the same .
Some 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months .
By contrast only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold .
Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control .
Even though only 12 % actually predicted a recession many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance .
Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession .
For the most part the changes were slight .
The two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who do n't believe in trying to predict the markets about 31 % and investors who do n't expect a recession about 15 % or are unsure if and when a recession might come about 22 % .
A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents .
Most own two to 10 stocks and buy or sell no more than three times a year .
Some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year only 57 % had sold any .
But the lurking shadow of 1987 's stock-market crash still seems dark .
About 33 % considered another crash likely while about 63 % said one is unlikely .
Those percentages hardly changed from the previous year 's poll .
And the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual .
About 60 % of them said they would ordinarily have at least 25 % of their money in stocks .
But as of August only 50 % actually had stock-market investments of that size .
Most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll .
But it appears that many Journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon .

Canadian steel ingot production totaled 276,334 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 14 down 5.3 % from the preceding week 's total of 291,890 tons Statistics Canada a federal agency said .
The week 's total was down 7.1 % from 297,446 tons a year earlier .
A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds .

Moody 's Investors Service said it lowered its rating on about 75 million of this Chatsworth Calif. concern 's convertible subordinated debentures due 2012 to Caa from B2 .
It said the reduction reflects impaired business prospects and reduced financial flexibility caused by continuing losses at the maker of Winchester disk drives .
VALLEY National Corp. Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on about 400 million of this bank holding company 's senior debt to B2 from Ba3 .
Moody 's said it expects Valley National of Phoenix Ariz. to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets and from high loan-loss provisions .
Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage .
That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage .
Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies said Noel D. Matchett a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc. Silver Spring Md .
It may well be that theft of business data is as serious a strategic threat to national security as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms said Michelle Van Cleave the White House 's assistant director for National Security Affairs .
The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association a joint industry-government trade group .
Any secret can be pirated the experts said if it is transmitted over the air .
Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder .
They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait .
You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time Mr. Matchett said adding It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught .
The only way to catch an electronic thief he said is to set him up with erroneous information .
Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year most are n't yet taking precautions the experts said .
By contrast European firms will spend 150 million this year on electronic security and are expected to spend 1 billion by 1992 .
Already many foreign firms especially banks have their own cryptographers conference speakers reported .
Still encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy .
One expert whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers for example doubling as foreign spies .
Moreover he said technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been erased from a computer 's memory .
He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read .
No personal computer not even the one on a chief executive 's desk is safe this speaker noted .
W. Mark Goode president of Micronyx Inc. a Richardson Texas firm that makes computer-security products provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev 's campaign for greater openness known commonly as glasnost .
Under Mr. Gorbachev Mr. Goode said the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications .
He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East .
Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company which had n't been invited to submit a bid .
The Soviets ' eavesdropping paid off however because they got the contract .
The University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp .
The University said the two companies agreed to spend 25 million Canadian dollars 21.3 million over 10 years on research at Canadian universities if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine maker .
It said 10 million would go to the University of Toronto .
Ciba-Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of 866 million for Connaught and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of 942 million .
The University is seeking an injunction against the Merieux bid arguing that Connaught 's predecessor company agreed in 1972 that Connaught 's ownership would n't be transferred to foreigners .
The university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if Ciba-Geigy and Chiron are successful with their lower bid .
It said the new agreement would replace the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover .
Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught this accord would enhance research and development in Canada said James Keffer the university 's vice president of research .
Ciba-Geigy is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and Chiron is based in Emeryville Calif .
In a statement Jacques-Francois Martin director general of Merieux said the French company is still determined to acquire Connaught .
While he did n't comment directly on the pact between Ciba-Geigy and the university he said Merieux can transfer new products and technologies to Connaught more rapidly than other companies not currently producing and marketing vaccines who can only promise this for some years in the future .

Row 21 of Section 9 of the Upper Reserved at Candlestick Park is a lofty perch only a few steps from the very top of the stands .
From my orange seat I looked over the first-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the World Series .
It was five in the afternoon but that was Pacific time .
Back in New York the work day was already over so I did n't have to feel guilty .
Even still I did feel self-indulgent and I could n't help remembering my father 's contempt for a rich medical colleague who would go to watch the Tigers on summer afternoons .
This ballpark the Stick was not a classic baseball stadium too symmetrical too much bald concrete .
And it did n't have the crowded wild intimacy of Yankee Stadium .
But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me liked it that they 'd brought their children found it charming that true citizens of the state of the future they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event .
Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history .
The broadcasters were after all documenting the game ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick .
Why not watch or hear your experience historicized while you were living it .
The day was saturated with the weight of its own impending history .
Long lines of people waited to buy special souvenir World Series postcards with official postmarks .
Thousands of us had paid 5 for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on Series trivia its historical photographs of great moments in Series past and its instructions in English and Spanish for filling in the scorecard .
Pitcher = lanzador .
Homerun = jonron .
Players ran out on the field way below and the stands began to reverberate .
It must be a local custom I thought stamping feet to welcome the team .
But then the noise turned into a roar .
And no one was shouting .
No one around me was saying anything .
Because we all were busy riding a wave .
Sixty thousand surfers atop a concrete wall waiting for the wipeout .
Only at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what was going on .
Then I remembered the quake of '71 which I experienced in Santa Barbara in a second-story motel room .
When the swaying of the building woke me up I reasoned that a I was in Southern California b the bed was moving c it must be a Magic Fingers bed that had short-circuited .
Then I noticed the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what had happened .
What should I do .
Get out of the possibly collapsing building to the parking lot .
But the lot might split into crevasses so I had better stand on my car which probably was wider than the average crevasse .
Fortunately the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood .
At the Stick while the world shook I thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different .
If I survived I would have achieved every journalist 's highest wish .
I was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment .
What was my angle .
How would I file .
All these thoughts raced through my head in the 15 seconds of the earthquake 's actual duration .
The rest is of course history .
The Stick did n't fall .
The real tragedies occurred elsewhere as we soon found out .
But for a few minutes there relief abounded .
A young mother found her boy who had been out buying a hotdog .
The wall behind me was slightly deformed but the center had held .
And most of us waited for a while for the game to start .
Then we began to file out to wait safely on terra firma for the opening pitch .
It was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the Stick that I really understood the point of all those Walkmen and Watchmen .
The crowd moved in clumps clumps magnetized around an electronic nucleus .
In this way while the Stick itself was blacked out we kept up to date on events .
Within 15 minutes of the quake itself I was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the Bay Bridge .
Increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before I got to my car .
And by then expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the gridlocked parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black plume of smoke we saw on the northern horizon .
Darkness fell .
But the broadcasts continued through the blacked-out night with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in Oakland and firefighting in the Marina district .
By then our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of listeners and viewers .
Everyone at the Stick that day had started out as a spectator and ended up as a participant .
In fact the entire population of the Bay Area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience .
The reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters .
The outstanding example of this was the motorist on the Bay Bridge who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway .
The tape was on tv before the night was out .
Marshall McLuhan you should have been there at that hour .
Investors who received Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions .
The first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank except for the page numbers .
Rather than printing devils Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market .
The plunge made Shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date .
In fact last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week .
Shearson a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co. did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so We decided to kill our strategy pieces says Jack Rivkin the head of Shearson 's research department .
The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary and that 's why it purged its pages .
Investors recalled that Shearson last week had been advising that the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance .
Many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views .
But Mr. Rivkin insists that the 10 pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish .
Instead he says they were cautious and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver on Monday .
As Mr. Rivkin explains it We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in Europe and concerns about the LBO market .
And by late Friday afternoon actually after the close we decided that was the wrong tone to take .
With the market down we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening .
Both before and after the Friday plunge Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65 % stocks 20 % bonds and 15 % cash .

China 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall .
In a report on China 's foundering economy the official State Statistical Bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9 % from a year earlier the lowest growth rate in a decade for September .
Retail sales are plummeting while consumer prices still are rising .
Chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation low growth and high inflation .
The economy is crashing hard says an Asian economist in Beijing .
The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected .
A lengthy recession if it materializes would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers .
Experts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit .
Unless the government suddenly reverses course wages for most workers wo n't keep pace with inflation creating a potential source of urban unrest .
The economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in September 1988 to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation .
Industrial output surged 21 % in 1988 while inflation peaked last February at nearly 30 % .
The slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw-materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week .
In Western market-driven countries recessions often have a bright side prodding the economy to greater efficiency .
In China however there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state .
Instead China is likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run enterprises which ate up 18 billion in bailouts last year .
Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt .
Rather the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private township enterprises which have fallen into disfavor as China 's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership .
When the going gets rough China penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent says a Western economist .
Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major Communist Party plenum for sometime in the next few weeks .
The meeting is expected to call for heightened austerity for two years .
But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy .
Some analysts believe China soon will begin relaxing economic controls particularly by loosening credit .
That would benefit Chinese enterprises as well as Sino-foreign joint ventures both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital .
A dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens if unchecked to bring the economy to a collapse .
One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of People 's Bank of China the central bank to allocate 5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest the official China Daily reported .
But while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation .
The cycle has been repeated several times since China began reforming its planned economy in 1979 .
And because China 's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy it is likely to continue analysts say .
The statistical bureau 's report cited in China Daily notes that industrial output in September totaled 29.4 billion a rise of just 0.9 % from a year earlier .
Output declined in several provinces including Jiangsu and Zhejiang two key coastal areas and Sichuan the nation 's agricultural breadbasket .
Production in Shanghai China 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government fell 1.8 % for the month .
Nationwide output of light industrial products declined 1.8 % the first decline in 10 years a bureau spokesman told China Daily .
In an unusually direct statement the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they can purchase manufacturers ' goods .
This will prevent a slide in industrial production which will otherwise cause new panic buyings the spokesman said .

And heavy-industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax credit .
Everything is up for grabs says Theodore Groom a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies .
Adds Robert Juliano the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again .
The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress .
Other fundamental reforms of the 1986 act have been threatened as well .
The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes .
The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts and also to bring back income averaging for farmers a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years .
As part of the same bill the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations in what committee member Sen. David Pryor D. Ark .
calls a feeding frenzy of special-interest legislating .
The beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops .
To be sure the full Senate facing a fast-approaching budget deadline last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill .
But lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary .
Other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts including both the capital-gains and IRA provisions .
There is n't any doubt that the thread of the '86 code has been given a mighty tug says Rep. Thomas Downey D. N.Y .
.
You 'll see the annual unraveling of it .
It 's back to tax-give-away time for the select few says Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania the third-ranking Democrat in the House .
Referring to the chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees he adds Next year every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on Lloyd Bentsen 's door on Danny Rostenkowski 's door .
Many groups are n't waiting that long .
Just last week a House Ways and Means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities companies and interest groups who want to open their own special loopholes .
It 's a Swiss-cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings .
Even lobbyists for heavy industry one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill are encouraged .
The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation write-offs or investment credits says Paul Huard a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers .
Corporate lobbyist Charls Walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve competitiveness .
In reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation groups are lobbying to make sure they are n't left off the gravy train .
Real-estate interests for example are protesting an omission in President Bush 's capital-gains proposal It does n't include real-estate gains .
If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains they certainly want to be part of it says real-estate lobbyist Wayne Thevenot of Concord Associates .
In the House-passed tax bill Mr. Thevenot got his wish real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision .
But Sotheby 's Christie 's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs .
They have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment .
Collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets the letter states .
All of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 .
In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others .
The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes .
Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses also known as passive losses that made many tax shelters possible .
Many other tax benefits also were swept away .
This year Congress with prodding from President Bush has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code .
It appears likely that this year or next some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted .
Other tax benefits probably will be restored and created .
The main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them .
The '86 act was a fluke .
They wanted reform and they got a revolution says overhaul advocate Rep. Willis Gradison R. Ohio .
So is the tax code now open game again .
Mr. Juliano thinks so .
One recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to San Francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of Chicago for the 30th reunion of St. Ignatius High School .
I 'm too old to waste a weekend but that 's what I did the 48-year-old Mr. Juliano moans .
These days anything can happen .
Lufthansa AG said passenger volume climbed 5.2 % for the first nine months of 1989 to 15.3 million passengers from 14.5 million passengers in the year-earlier period .
The West German national air carrier said cargo volume jumped 12 % to 638,000 metric tons from 569,000 tons a year ago .
Load factor or percentage of seats filled climbed to 67.1 % from 66.6 % even though the number of flights rose 6.9 % to 215,845 in the first-three quarters .
From January through September the distance flown by Lufthansa airplanes rose 5.6 % to 266.2 million kilometers from a year earlier the company added .
Raymond Chandler in a 1950 letter defending a weak Hemingway book likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher .
When the champ has lost his stuff the great mystery novelist wrote when he can no longer throw the high hard one he throws his heart instead .
He throws something .
He does n't just walk off the mound and weep .
Chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career .
His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe the inferior Playback 1958 at times read almost like a parody of his previous work .
When he died in 1959 Chandler left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book The Poodle Springs Story which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque .
Champ Chandler 's last pitch apparently was a screwball .
Now Robert Parker author of several best sellers featuring Spenser a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired to complete The Poodle Springs Story .
The result Poodle Springs Putnam 's 288 pages 18.95 is an entertaining easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color .
If it does not quite have Chandler 's special magic well at the end neither did Chandler .
As the book begins a newly Marlowe roars into the desert resort of Poodle a.k.a .
Palm Springs at the wheel of a Cadillac Fleetwood .
His bride is the rich and beautiful Linda Loring a character who also appeared in Chandler 's The Long Goodbye and Playback .
Philip and Linda move into her mansion and ca n't keep their hands off each other even in front of the Hawaiian\/Japanese houseman .
But the lovebirds have a conflict .
He wants to continue being a low-paid private eye and she wants him to live off the million dollars she 's settled on him .
That 's Chandler 's setup .
Mr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds .
The supporting lineup is solid the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls the good cop of previous Chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes .
The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler 's prose at its most pared down .
All told Mr. Parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect .
But there are grounds for complaint .
At one point the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro .
More bothersome there are several apparent anachronisms .
Contact lenses tank tops prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s .
A little more care in re-creating Marlowe 's universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable .
Mr. Nolan is a contributing editor at Los Angeles Magazine .
Ko Shioya spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of Reader 's Digest .
Japan has been a major importer of foreign information and news says Mr. Shioya .
But one gets fed up with importing information and news .
Mr. Shioya has turned the tables .
Today he is publisher of Business Tokyo magazine the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business .
After a slick redesign the two-year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company Keizaikai Corp. the Tokyo-based company with interests that include financial services book publishing and a tourist agency .
Printed in the U.S. and carrying the line The Insider 's Japan Business Tokyo 's October cover story was The World 's No. 1 Customer Japanese women .
Keizaikai is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing after making major investments in entertainment real estate and banking companies here .
Japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers to study the U.S. market including the New York-based investment banker Veronis Suhler & Associates .
And they are quietly linking up with U.S. publishing trade groups .
Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries said John Veronis chairman of Veronis Suhler .
While there are n't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of Sony Corp. 's recent 3.4 billion agreement to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. observers do n't rule out a transaction of that size .
The Japanese take the long view .
said Mr. Veronis .
It may not be weeks or months but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable they will move on a deal he said .
In recent months three big Tokyo-based publishing concerns including Nikkei Business Publications Nikkei Home no relation and Magazine House applied for membership in Magazine Publishers of America which represents almost all U.S. consumer magazines .
Japanese involvement in American publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as Business Tokyo are considered groundbreakers .
When Keizaikai launched Business Tokyo in 1987 it appealed to a more multinational audience .
The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers .
American publishers appear more than ready to do some selling .
Susumu Ohara president of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc. publisher of the Japan Economic Journal said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine .
The Japanese are in the early stage right now said Thomas Kenney a onetime media adviser for First Boston Corp. who was recently appointed president of Reader 's Digest Association 's new Magazine Publishing Group .
Before they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft .
Now they realize magazines are as much a franchise as Nabisco is a franchise .
Bell Atlantic Corp. and Southern New England Telecommunications posted strong profit gains for the third quarter while Nynex Corp. Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. reported earnings declines for the period .
Rate settlements in Minnesota and Colorado depressed U S West 's third-quarter profit .
Denver-based U S West said net income dropped 8.9 % noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its BetaWest Properties unit .
Revenue dropped 4.3 % to 2.3 billion from 2.4 billion reflecting declines in its consumer-telephone sector long-distance carrier business and diversified division .
Revenue from business-telephone operations grew 3.3 % to 618.9 million from 599.4 million a year ago .
New telephone lines posted healthy growth .
Overall they increased 2.8 % to 12.1 million putting U S West over the 12 million mark for the first time .
Business lines increased 3.7 % to 3.3 million .
On a truly comparable basis we 've seen modest earnings growth this year from the operations of our company said Jack MacAllister chairman and chief executive officer .
The major negative factor was the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years .
He said the company expects to be on target with analysts ' projections by year end but conceded that the fourth quarter represents a significant challenge .
Expenses in the quarter dropped 11.2 % to 664.3 million from 747.7 million a year ago .
Yesterday U S West shares rose 75 cents to close at 71.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic said net rose 6.5 % aided by strong growth in the network-services business and an increase in the number of new telephone lines .
Revenue jumped 5.6 % to 2.9 billion from 2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter .
Revenue from financial and real-estate services jumped 23 % to 177.4 million from 144.1 million a year ago .

The company said per-share earnings were slightly reduced by the sale of 4.1 million shares of treasury stock to the company 's newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plans .
In composite trading on the Big Board Bell Atlantic closed at 100.625 up 1.50 a share .
At Nynex net slumped 14.8 % primarily because of a continuing strike by 60,000 employees lower-than-expected profit at its New York Telephone unit and significantly higher taxes and costs .
State and local taxes increased to 131.3 million from 99.1 million a year ago .
Nynex said expenses rose 4.5 % to 2.73 billion from 2.61 billion a 119 million increase .
Most of the higher costs were associated with acquisitions and growth in nonregulated business units it added .
Our net income is n't where we would want it to be at this point said William C. Ferguson chairman and chief executive officer .
This deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at New York Telephone .
Mr. Ferguson said a continued softness in New York City area 's economy and increased competition particularly in the private-line market took a heavy toll on earnings .
The three-month-old strike at Nynex seriously hurt the installation of new telephone lines in the quarter .
Nynex said access lines in service at the end of the quarter were off 18,000 from the previous quarter which reported an increase of 160,000 new access lines .
Revenue rose to 3.31 billion from 3.18 billion mostly from acquisition of AGS Computers and robust non-regulated businesses .

Cost and expenses for the quarter excluding interest increased 6.1 % to 333.3 million from 314 million the year before .
SNET common rose 1.25 to 85.50 a share yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board .
San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis said net declined 12.6 % primarily because of regulatory action .
Revenue was about flat at 2.4 billion .
Revenue was reduced 33 million by three extraordinary items a California Public Utilities Commission refund for an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. billing adjustment a provision for productivity sharing to be paid to customers in 1990 and a one-time accrual for a toll settlement with long-distance telephone companies .
Excluding the one-time charges the company would have posted earnings of 298 million or 73 cents a share .
The company also was hurt by a 289 million rate reduction that went into effect in 1989 .
This is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals said Sam Ginn chairman and chief executive officer .
Pacific Telesis said new telephone lines increased 4.5 % for a total of about 13.5 million for the quarter toll calls increased 9.6 % to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion .
In Big Board composite trading yesterday Pacific Telesis common closed at 45.50 up 87.5 cents .

b Includes a 41.3 million gain on the sale of FiberCom .
Amoco Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 39 % to 336 million or 65 cents a share as gasoline refining and marketing profits lagged substantially behind last year 's record level .
A charge of 80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results .
A spokesman said Amoco completed an environmental analysis last quarter but that no single clean-up project was responsible .
In the 1988 third quarter the Chicago-based oil company earned 552 million or 1.07 a share .
Revenue in the latest quarter rose 12 % to 6.6 billion from 5.91 billion .
Aside from the special charge Amoco 's results were in line with Wall Street estimates .
The company 's stock ended at 48.375 up 25 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Amoco is the first major oil company to report third-quarter results .
Analysts expect others to show a similar pattern .
Generally in the quarter overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability .
The industry 's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity has depressed prices .
Gasoline margins may rebound this quarter some industry officials say but they believe chemical margins could worsen .
American Petrofina Inc. a Dallas-based integrated oil company yesterday said its third-quarter earnings declined by more than half .
Fina blamed lower chemical prices reduced gasoline margins and refinery maintenance shutdowns .
It said net income dropped to 15.1 million or 98 cents a share from 35.2 million or 2.66 a share .
Sales rose 2.2 % to 711.9 million from 696.1 million .
Amoco 's refining and marketing profit in the quarter fell to 134 million from 319 million .
Chemical earnings declined by one-third to 120 million last year 's robust levels .
Amoco 's domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of 104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of 5 million primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices said Chairman Richard M. Morrow .
Amoco also sharply boosted natural-gas output part of it from properties acquired from Tenneco Inc. last year .
But foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply to 12 million from 95 million .
Higher oil prices were n't enough to offset a roughly 20 million charge related to a 10 % reduction in Amoco 's Canadian work force as well as increased exploration expenses .
For the nine months Amoco said that net income fell to 1.29 billion from 1.69 billion but if unusual items are excluded operations produced essentially flat results .
Revenue rose 12 % to 19.93 billion from 17.73 billion .
James F. Gero former chairman and chief executive officer of Varo Inc. and Richard J. Hatchett III a Dallas investment banker were elected directors of this medical-products concern boosting the board to seven members .
For retailers Christmas not Halloween promises to be this year 's spookiest season .
Many retailers fear a price war will erupt if cash-strapped companies such as Campeau Corp. slash tags to spur sales .
Concerns about the stock market doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also haunt store operators .
Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer asserts Norman Abramson president and chief operating officer of Clothestime Inc. an off-price chain .
Even if there is n't any widespread discounting the outlook for industry profits is n't good .
Management Horizons forecasts a 1.4 % profit decline for non-auto retailers this year after annual drops that averaged 4.5 % in 1988 and 1987 .
For the last two and a half years retailing has been in a mild recession says Carl Steidtmann chief economist at the Columbus Ohio consulting firm .
This year many stores are entering the Christmas season in turmoil Bonwit Teller and B. Altman parent L.J. Hooker Corp. is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code B.A.T Industries PLC 's healthy Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field 's chains are on the auction block Campeau 's Bloomingdale 's is also on the block .
Industry observers expect a wide divergence in performance .
Stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly and to lose customers to stable chains such as Limited Inc. May Department Stores Co. and Dillard Department Stores Inc. which should do well .
There are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers says Cynthia Turk a Touche Ross & Co. retail consultant .
Says Mr. Steidtmann I 'm looking for a bi-polar Christmas .
Economists expect general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter to rise 4.5 % to 6 % from year-ago figures .
But Mr. Steidtmann predicts that healthy stores hawking mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as 25 % to 30 % .
Troubled chains could see their sales drop as much as 8 % he believes as managers distracted by fears about the future allow their stores to get sloppy .
Thin merchandise selections at the most troubled chains are also expected to hurt sales .
Catalog companies are likely to pose a bigger threat to all stores this year particularly in December .
More than 200 catalog outfits are promoting a low-cost Federal Express service that guarantees pre-Christmas delivery of orders made by a certain date .
Traditionally consumers were concerned about ordering after the first of December because they did n't believe they would get it by Christmas says Adam Strum chairman of the Wine Enthusiast Inc. which sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail .
Using Federal Express delivery last year Mr. Strum says December was our biggest month .
Even Sears Roebuck & Co. is getting into the act offering for the first time to have Federal Express deliver toys ordered by Dec. 20 from its Wish Book catalog .
K mart Corp. Chairman Joseph E. Antonini summed up his outlook for the Christmas season as not troublesome .
He 's not predicting a blockbuster but he is more optimistic than three months ago because employment remains strong and inflation low .
Other retailers are also preparing for a ho-hum holiday .
Philip M. Hawley chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. expects sales at department stores op
