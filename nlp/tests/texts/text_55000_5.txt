d month of short interest .
The Big Board reported that short interest dropped to 523,920,214 shares as of Oct. 13 from 547,347,585 shares in mid-September .
Amex short interest climbed 3 % to 53,496,665 shares from 51,911,566 shares .
For the year-earlier month the Big Board reported 461,539,056 shares indicating a 13.5 % year-to-year rise while the Amex reported 36,015,194 shares a 48 % leap .
Amex short interest has been heading upward since mid-December with increases in each month since then except at mid-July .
Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender .
Short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders .
Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back .
Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging .
The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock .
The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month 's 3.38 .
The ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange 's average trading volume that would be required to convert the total short interest position .
Some analysts suggest however that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions .

Your Oct. 12 editorial Pitiful Helpless Presidency .
correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3 .
You are absolutely wrong however in opining that this position is some kind of flip-flop something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls .
My position is one founded on both the facts and the law .
Although you may have forgotten public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative .
The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 9 10 and 11 1988 and again on April 4 1988 .
It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega 's criminality and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies .
Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him and to exploit the administration 's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing .
As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics but made a decision in the summer of 1986 to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled .
As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war .
This decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the United States as a hidden cost of the war .
Unfortunately this problem continued even after Gen. Noriega 's indictment .
Throughout 1988 and this year I and others in Congress have pressed the U.S. to develop a plan for pushing this narcokleptocrat out of Panama .
Regrettably two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable to develop any plan military or economic for supporting the Panamanian people in their attempts to restore democracy .
Sen. John Kerry D. Mass .
For Vietnamese these are tricky often treacherous times .
After years of hesitation economic and political reform was embraced at the end of 1986 but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action .
Vietnam is finding that turning a stagnant socialist order into a dynamic free market does n't come easy .
Here is how three Vietnamese are coping with change The Tire King Nguyen Van Chan is living proof that old ways die hard .
Mr. Chan used to be an oddity in Hanoi a private entrepreneur .
His business success made him an official target in pre-reform days .
Mr. Chan now 64 years old invented a fountain pen he and his family produced from plastic waste .
Later he marketed glue .
Both products were immensely popular .
For his troubles Mr. Chan was jailed three times between 1960 and 1974 .
Though his operation was registered and used only scrap he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials .
Once he was held for three months without being charged .
Things were supposed to change when Vietnam 's economic reforms gathered pace and for awhile they did .
After years of experimenting Mr. Chan produced a heavy-duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state-produced rival .
By 1982 he was selling thousands of tires .
Newspapers published articles about him and he was hailed as the tire king .
His efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition and attracted renewed attention from local authorities .
District police in 1983 descended on his suburban home which he and his large family used as both residence and factory and demanded proof the house and equipment were his .
He produced it .
That was the first time they lost and I won he says .
He was further questioned to determine if he was a real working man or an exploiter .
Says Mr. Chan When I showed it was from my own brain they lost for the second time .
But a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property .
Warned he was to be jailed again he fled to the countryside .
His family was given three hours to leave before the house and contents were confiscated .
With only the clothes they were wearing family members moved to a home owned by one of Mr. Chan 's sons .
After six months on the run Mr. Chan learned the order for his arrest had been canceled .
He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights .
He and his family kept afloat by repairing bicycles selling fruit and doing odd jobs .
Mr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 and became a minor celebrity again when his story was published in a weekly newspaper .
In 1988 18 months after the sixth congress formally endorsed family-run private enterprise district authorities allowed Mr. Chan to resume work .
By late last year he was invited back as the tire king to display his products at a national exhibition .
National leaders stopped by his stand to commend his achievements .
Mr. Chan now produces 1,000 bicycle and motorbike tires a month and 1,000 tins of tire-patching glue in the son 's small house .
Eighteen people pack the house 's two rooms the Chans four of their 10 children with spouses and eight of 22 grandchildren .
Most sleep on the floor .
Come daybreak eight family members and two other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street .
The primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small courtyard where an ancient press squeezes rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a bathtub filled with water .
Mr. Chan talks optimistically of expanding maybe even moving into the import-export field .
First however he has unfinished business .
When district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing they released only one of his machines .
They did n't return the rubber stocks that represent his capital .
Nor did they return his house and contents which he values at about 44,000 .
He wants to recover more than just his property though .
I want my dignity back he says .
The Editor Nguyen Ngoc seemed an obvious choice when the Vietnamese Writers Association was looking for a new editor to reform its weekly newspaper Van Nghe .
After the sixth congress journalists seized the opportunity provided by the liberalization to probe previously taboo subjects .
Mr. Ngoc 57 years old had solid reformist credentials He had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature .
Appointed editor in chief in July 1987 Mr. Ngoc rapidly turned the staid Van Nghe into Vietnam 's hottest paper .
Circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover Vietnamese society and its ills .
Readers were electrified by the paper 's audacity and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered .
One article recounted a decade-long struggle by a wounded soldier to prove officially he was alive .
Another described how tax-collection officials in Thanh Hoa province one night stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers .
The newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by Nguyen Huy Thiep a former history teacher who stirred debate over his interpretation of Vietnamese culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association .
Van Nghe quickly made influential enemies .
Those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly to the restyled paper says Lai Nguyen An a literary critic .
After months of internal rumblings Mr. Ngoc was fired last December .
His dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that continues today .
Under Mr. Ngoc Van Nghe protected the people instead of the government says Nguyen Duy a poet who is the paper 's bureau chief for southern Vietnam .
The paper reflected the truth .
For the leadership that was too painful to bear .
The Billionaire Nguyen Thi Thi is Vietnam 's entrepreneur of the 1980s .
Her challenge is to keep her fledgling empire on top in the 1990s .
Mrs. Thi did n't wait for the reforms to get her start .
She charged ahead of the government and the law to establish Hochiminh City Food Co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country .
Her success which included alleviating an urban food shortage in the early 1980s helped persuade Hanoi to take the reform path .
Her story is becoming part of local folklore .
A lifelong revolutionary with little education who fought both the French and the U.S.-backed Saigon regime she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war .
Her instincts were capitalistic despite her background .
As she rode over regulations only her friendship with party leaders including Nguyen Van Linh then Ho Chi Minh City party secretary kept her out of jail .
Following Mr. Linh 's appointment as secretary-general of the party at the sixth congress Mrs. Thi has become the darling of doi moi the Vietnamese version of perestroika .
The authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of the new way of thinking .
Foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her Vietnam 's richest woman .
Some people call me the communist billionaire she has told visitors .
Actually 67-year-old Mrs. Thi is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land .
She has indeed turned Hochiminh City Food into a budding conglomerate but the company itself remains state-owned .
She manages it with the title of general-director .
The heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities such as corn and coffee from farmers in the south paying with fertilizer farm tools and other items .
Last year Hochiminh City Food says it bought two million metric tons of unhusked rice more than 10 % of the country 's output .
The company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses .
A subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that are sold with the rice through a vast retail network .
In recent years Mrs. Thi has started to diversify the company taking a 20 % stake in newly established partly private Industrial and Commercial Bank and setting up Saigon Petro which owns and operates Vietnam 's first oil refinery .
Mrs. Thi says Hochiminh City Food last year increased pretax profit 60 % to the equivalent of about 2.7 million on sales of 150 million .
She expects both revenue and profit to gain this year .
She is almost cavalier about the possibility Vietnam 's reforms will create rivals on her home turf .
I do n't mind the competition inside the country she says .
I am only afraid that with Vietnam 's poor-quality products we ca n't compete with neighboring countries .
The earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area is n't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings officials at the two major rating agencies said .
Standard & Poor 's Corp. is reviewing debt issued by 12 California counties and there are potential isolated problems said Hyman Grossman a managing director .
The agency is preparing a report to be issued today on the earthquake 's impact on the property- and casualty-insurance industry .
The only securities so far to be singled out are those issued by Bay View Federal Savings & Loan .
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing with an eye toward a possible downgrade the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company Bay View Capital Corp .
As for property and casualty insurers Moody 's said preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers ' financial condition but it raises concerns about potentially substantial risks longer-term .
Losses from the earthquake are expected to be of similar magnitude to those of Hurricane Hugo according to Moody 's .

Western Digital Corp. reported a net loss of 2.7 million or nine cents a share for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 citing factors as varied as hurricane damage an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar .
In the year-ago period the company earned 12.9 million or 45 cents a share on sales of 247 million .
Sales for the just-ended period fell to about 225 million the maker of computer parts said .
Nonetheless Chairman Roger W. Johnson said he expects the company to be profitable in the current quarter .
We are positioned to come through he said noting that the company 's backlog was up from the previous quarter .
In its second quarter last year Western Digital earned 12.7 million or 44 cents a share on sales of 258.4 million .
Mr. Johnson said Western Digital 's plant in Puerto Rico was affected by Hurricane Hugo losing three days ' production because of the storm which wrecked much of the Caribbean island 's infrastructure .
Although the plant itself was n't damaged Mr. Johnson said millions of dollars in first-quarter revenue were lost .
The revenue will be regained in the current period he added .
There are no plans to initiate a common stock dividend Mr. Johnson said explaining that the board continues to believe shareholders are best served by reinvesting excess cash .
Mr. Johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards .
Western Digital does n't make the monitors .
An accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers ' to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further dampened reseller purchases of Western Digital 's equipment .
The other areas of the business storage and microcomputers were very good Mr. Johnson said .
He said Western Digital has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array VGA graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter EGA which has a lower resolution standard technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units .
Other makers of video controller equipment also were caught in the EGA-VGA shift he said but we were able to respond much more quickly .
Still Mr. Johnson said our stock is grossly undervalued .
He said the company has cut operating expenses by about 10 % over the last few quarters while maintaining research and development at about 8 % to 9 % of sales .
As part of its reorganization this week Western Digital has divided its business into two segments storage products including controllers and disk drives and microcomputer products which include graphics communications and peripheral control chips .
Graphics communications and peripheral control chips were combined because increasingly multiple functions are being governed by a single chip .
Storage which includes computer controllers and 3.5-inch disk drives represents nearly two-thirds of the company 's business .
Disk drives which allow a computer to access its memory generated 38 % more revenue in the most recent period compared with the fiscal first quarter a year earlier .
Computer parts are getting ever smaller Mr. Johnson said a shrinking that has propelled laptops into position as the fastest-growing segment of the computer business .
As smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry he said Western Digital is strengthening development of laptop parts .
Next year Western Digital plans to consolidate its operations from 11 buildings in Irvine into two buildings in the same city a new headquarters and a block away a modern 100 million silicon wafer fabrication plant .
The plan will help the company in its existing joint manufacturing agreement with AT&T .
About half of Western Digital 's business is overseas and Mr. Johnson expects that proportion to continue .
Plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within Europe in 1992 creates significant opportunities for the company he said particularly since Western Digital already manufactures there .
Capitalizing on that presence Western Digital is launching a major effort to develop the embryonic reseller market in Europe .
Directors of state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank 's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution .
Until now BNL 's top managers and its directors have been appointed by a Treasury decree .
But under the bank 's proposed statutes an assembly of shareholders must approve board members .
The bank 's chairman and director general who also sit on the board still would be appointed by the Treasury .
BNL which is controlled by the Italian Treasury was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq .
The ensuing scandal in which the bank 's management resigned has helped renew calls for privatization or at least an overhaul of Italy 's banking system which is about 80 % state-controlled .
In a related move the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure .
BNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals .
BNL has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange .
The shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the Atlanta scandal Consob the stock exchange regulatory body reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension .
Switzerland 's wholesale price index increased 0.3 % in September from August and was up 3.9 % from a year ago marking the first time this year that the index has fallen below 4 % on a year-to-year basis the government reported .
The government attributed the 0.3 % month-to-month rise in the index largely to higher energy prices .
In August the index was up 0.2 % from the previous month and was up 4.5 % on a year-to-year basis .
The wholesale price index based on 1963 as 100 was 180.9 in September .
American Express Co. posted a 21 % increase in third quarter net income despite a sharp rise in reserves for Third World loans at its banking unit .
Aided by a sharp gain in its travel business American Express said net rose to 331.8 million or 77 cents a share from 273.9 million or 64 cents a share .

Profit rose 38 % at American Express Information Services to 21.6 million .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. as previously reported had net of 65.9 million reversing a 3.5 million loss a year earlier its latest results include a 37 million gain from the sale of an institutional money management business .
American Express 's share of Shearson 's earnings was 41 million after preferred stock dividends it owns about 68 % of Shearson 's common .
For the nine months American Express said net rose 11 % to 899.8 million or 2.09 a share from 807.5 million or 1.89 a share .
Revenue rose 24 % to 18.73 billion from 15.09 billion .
Textron Inc. hampered by a slowdown in its defense sales reported an 8 % decline in per-share earnings on nearly flat revenue for its third quarter .
The aerospace and financial services concern said net income fell 5 % to 59.5 million from 62.8 million .
Revenue of 1.73 billion was almost unchanged from last year 's 1.72 billion .
Per-share net of 66 cents down from 72 cents fell by more than overall net because of more shares outstanding .
The company said that improved results in its financial-services sector were negated by increased costs in its government contract business lower operating earnings in its commercial-products sector and soft automotive markets .
Net was aided by a lower income tax rate .
Profit before taxes fell 17 % to 84.4 million from 101.4 million .
For the nine months Textron reported net of 182.1 million or 2.06 a share on revenue of 5.41 billion .
A year ago net was 170.4 million or 1.93 a share on revenue of 5.3 billion .
The nine-month results included a 9.5 million special charge in 1989 for an arbitration settlement related to past export sales and 29.7 million in extraordinary charges in 1988 related to a former line of business and early redemption of debt .
Textron said that nine-months ' results do n't include earnings of Avdel PLC a British maker of industrial fasteners but do include interest costs of 16.4 million on borrowings related to the proposed purchase of Avdel .
A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the purchase because of Federal Trade Commission concerns that the transaction would reduce competition in the production of two kinds of rivets .
For the quarter Textron said aerospace revenue including Bell helicopter and jet-engine manufacture declined 9.8 % to 755.9 million from 838.3 million an indication of slowing government defense work .
As the Hunt brothers ' personal bankruptcy cases sputter into their second year Minpeco S.A. has proposed a deal to settle its huge claim against the troubled Texas oil men .
But the plan only threatens to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in September 1988 .
The Peruvian mineral concern 's 251 million claim stems from 1988 jury award in a case stemming from the brothers ' alleged attempts to corner the 1979-80 silver market .
Minpeco now says it is willing to settle for up to 65.7 million from each brother although the actual amount would probably be much less .
Although the proposal must be approved by federal Judge Harold C. Abramson W. Herbert Hunt has agreed to the Peruvian mineral concern 's proposal .
Nelson Bunker Hunt is considering it although his attorney says he wo n't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement he has reached with the Internal Revenue Service which claims the brothers owe 1 billion in back taxes and is by far the biggest creditor in both cases .
The tentative agreement between the IRS and Nelson Bunker Hunt is awaiting U.S. Justice Department approval .
Under it the former billionaire 's assets would be liquidated with the IRS getting 80 % of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other creditors including Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. which is seeking repayment of a 36 million loan .
A similiar proposal has been made in the W. Herbert Hunt case although he and the IRS are at odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt he would have to pay to the government from future earnings .
In both cases Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie .
With support from the IRS Manufacturers Hanover has filed suit asking Judge Abramson to subordinate Minpeco 's claim to those of Manufacturer Hanover and the IRS .
Minpeco has threatened a volcano of litigation if the Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit attempts to force such a plan through the court .
Minpeco said it would n't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the W. Herbert Hunt case is approved by Judge Abramson who will consider the proposal at a hearing next week .
Minpeco attorney Thomas Gorman decribed the plan as one step toward an overall settlement of the W. Herbert Hunt case but Hugh Ray attorney for Manufacturers Hanover called it silly and said he would fight it in court .
The thing is so fluid right now that there 's really no way to say what will happen says Justice Department attorney Grover Hartt III who represents the IRS in the case .
Developments like this are hard to predict .
Banc One Corp. said it agreed in principle to buy five branch offices from Trustcorp Inc. Toledo Ohio following the planned merger of Trustcorp into Society Corp. Cleveland .
The five offices in Erie and Ottawa counties in northern Ohio have total assets of about 88 million Banc One said .
The purchase price will be established after Banc One has an opportunity to study the quality of the assets Banc One said .
Society Corp. already has branches in the area and selling the Trustcorp offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of Trustcorp into Society according to industry sources .
The merger is scheduled to take place in the 1990 first quarter .
Stock-market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money-market mutual fund assets up 6.07 billion in the latest week the sharpest increase in almost two years .
The 473 funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute a Washington-based trade group rose to 356.1 billion a record .
The 6.07 billion increase was the strongest weekly inflow since January 1988 .
The increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds .
Individual investors represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds said Jacob Dreyer vice president and chief economist of the Institute .
Insitutional investors on the other hand reacted to the steep decline in yields on direct money-market instruments following the stock-market decline last Friday Mr. Dreyer said .
Yields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday according to Donoghue 's Money Fund Report a Holliston Mass. newsletter .
The average seven-day compounded yield fell to 8.55 % from 8.60 % the week earlier Donoghue 's said .
At the auction of six-month U.S. Treasury bills on Monday the average yield fell to 7.61 % from 7.82 % .
Likewise certificates of deposit on average posted lower yields in the week ended Tuesday .
The 142 institutional-type money funds rose 2.23 billion to 85.49 billion .
The 235 general-purpose funds increased 2.53 billion to 116.56 billion while 96 broker-dealer funds increased 1.3 billion to 154.05 billion .
Domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd. 's most recent spate of financial troubles the institution 's executive chairman Mohamed Basir Ismail said .
Speaking to reporters this week after Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders approved a rescue plan Tan Sri Basir said heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in Malaysia plummeted in 1984-85 .
He said the bank could n't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans .
So the bank 's board decided to make 1.23 billion Malaysian dollars 457 million in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank and to submit a bailout package to replenish the bank 's paid-up capital .
The predicament he added was similar to the Hong Kong 1982-83 property-price collapse which exposed the involvement of Bank Bumiputra 's former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in Malaysia 's history .
The subsidiary Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd. was left with 2.26 billion in bad loans made to Hong Kong property speculators .
Both episodes wiped out Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders ' funds .
Each time the bank 's 90 % shareholder Petroliam Nasional Bhd. or Petronas the national oil company has been called upon to rescue the institution .
In five years Petronas which became the dominant shareholder in a 1984 rescue exercise has spent about 3.5 billion to prop up the troubled bank .
Tan Sri Basir said the capital restructuring plan has been approved by Malaysia 's Capital Issues Committee and central bank .
Malaysia 's High Court is expected to approve the plan .
Once the plan is approved Tan Sri Basir said most of Bank Bumiputra 's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between 160 million and 170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31 .
For the previous financial year the bank would have reported a pretax profit of 168 million if it had n't made provisions for the nonperforming loans he said .
Malaysia 's Banking Secrecy Act prohibited the bank from identifying delinquent borrowers said Tan Sri Basir .
But public documents indicate 10 % or more of the bank 's provisions were made for foregone interest on a 200 million loan to Malaysia 's dominant political party the United Malays National Organization to build its convention and headquarters complex in Kuala Lumpur .
The loan to UMNO was made in September 1983 .
We lent a lot of money all over the place said Tan Sri Basir who refused to discuss the bank 's outstanding loans to As well as the 1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6 the restructuring package covers an additional 450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank 's paid-up capital .
At the end of the exercise the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank 's paid-up capital to 1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions .
Heidi Ehman might have stepped from a recruiting poster for young Republicans .
White 24 years old a singer in her church choir she symbolizes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to Ronald Reagan .
I felt kind of safe she says .
No longer .
When the Supreme Court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion Ms. Ehman opened her mind to Democratic politics .
Then a political novice she stepped into a whirl of pro-choice marches house parties and fund-raisers .
Now she leads a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in Passaic County for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio .
This is one where I cross party lines she says rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. Florio 's opponent Reagan-Republican Rep. James Courter .
People my age thought it was n't going to be an issue .
Now it has especially for people my age .
Polls bear out this warning but after a decade of increased Republican influence here the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter .
Unless he closes the gap Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month .
Going into the 1990s the GOP is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment Democrats in the past .
This change comes less from a shift in public opinion which has n't changed much on abortion over the past decade than in the boundaries of the debate .
New Jersey 's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion but the U.S. Supreme Court ruling Webster vs. Missouri has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue .
Before July pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion .
Now the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces .
A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands and in a major reversal Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest .
If Webster had n't happened you would n't be here Linda Bowker tells a reporter in the Trenton office of the National Organization for Women .
We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter and no one would have heard us .
New Jersey is a proving ground for this aggressive women's-rights movement this year .
The infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures .
In Cherry Hill the National Abortion Rights Action League whose goal is to sign up 50,000 pro-choice voters targets a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause .
The league organizers seem more a fit with a convention next door of young aerobics instructors in leotards than the beefy union leaders I wish I could go work out says a slim activist .
A labor chief speaks sardonically of having to man and woman Election Day phones .
No age group is more sensitive than younger voters like Ms. Ehman .
A year ago this fall New Jersey voters under 30 favored George Bush by 56 % to 39 % over Michael Dukakis according to a survey then by Rutgers University 's Eagleton Institute .
A matching Eagleton-Newark Star Ledger poll last month showed a complete reversal .
Voters in the same age group backed Democrat Florio 55 % to 29 % over Republican Courter .
Abortion alone ca n't explain this shift but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate .
By a 2-to-1 ratio voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio 's stance on abortion and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue .
The times are my times says Mr. Florio .
The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark I'm-coming-down-your-throat intensity but at a pause in Newark 's Columbus Day parade recently he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city 's old Italian-American ward .
After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor 's race he has prepared himself methodically for this moment including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions .
If you 're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right he asks how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not .
Mr. Courter by comparison seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran-Contra hearings two years ago .
Looking back he says he erred by stating his personal opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he would n't impose his views on policy as governor .
It is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate .
He does n't know himself Kathy Stanwick of the Abortion Rights League says of Mr. Courter 's position .
Even abortion opponents however angry with Mr. Florio ca n't hide their frustration with the Republican 's ambivalence .
He does n't want to lead the people says Richard Traynor president of New Jersey Right to Life .
Moreover by stepping outside the state 's pro-choice tradition Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment .
He hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate and by wavering on this issue and abortion he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides .
Elected to Congress in 1978 the 48-year-old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan .
Like many of his colleagues he did n't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors .
Jack Kemp and the writers Irving Kristol and George Gilder were influences and Mr. Courter 's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current New Jersey GOP governor Thomas Kean in the 1981 Republican primary here .
The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter 's fortunes but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate pro-choice Gov. Kean .
While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government anti-tax agenda in Washington Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey 's budget in his eight years in office .
Kean forces play down any differences with Mr. Courter but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government .
Mr. Courter 's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov. Kean 's own insurance commissioner .
Mr. Courter is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers .
Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head .
He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park .
Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office .
I do n't think we do now he says .
I think we did .
Asked the same question after his appearance Democrat Florio identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today .
When he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization 's 20th anniversary he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in Camden .
Details and Camden are essential Florio .
Elected to Congress as a Watergate baby in 1974 he ran for governor three years later .
In the opinion of many he has n't stopped running since even though he declined a rematch with Gov. Kean in 1985 .
His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge .
With limited budgets for television in a high-priced market Mr. Florio 's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage .
More than ever his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the state .
Auto insurance rates are soaring .
A toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer .
In Monmouth an important swing area Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county clean and green .
Mr. Florio savors this vindication but at age 52 the congressman is also a product of his times and losses .
He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 to increase state revenue he focuses not on taxes but on audits to cut waste .
Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s .
Appealing to a young audience he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead .
The lyric chosen long strange night may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar .
The Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county 's past corruption .
His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater Trenton State College .
Mr. Florio 's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the Webster ruling divides some of his old constituency .
Pasquale Pignatelli an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an Essex County Irish bagpipe band speaks sadly of Mr. Florio .
I am a devout Catholic says Mr. Pignatelli a 40-year-old health officer .
I ca n't support him because of abortion .
Bill Wames Sr. 72 is Catholic too but unfazed by Mr. Florio 's stand on abortion .
A security guard at a cargo terminal he wears a Sons of Italy jacket and cap celebrating The US 1 Band .
I still think the woman has the right to do with her body as she pleases he says .
If you want more opinions ask my wife .
She has lots of opinions .
Consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate 0.2 % in September pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs the Labor Department reported .
Energy costs which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month continued to decline at the retail level pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs .
The report was the brightest news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than 190 points last Friday .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on the news closing 39.55 points higher at 2683.20 .
Bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall .
But many economists were not nearly as jubilant .
The climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months they warned .
They also said the dollar is leveling off after a rise this summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods .
I think inflation is going to pick up through the fall said Joel Popkin a specialist on inflation who runs an economic consulting firm here .
It has been in what I would describe as a lull for the past several months .
We 've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now said Jay Woodworth chief domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. in New York .
Because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep 6.5 % last month many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too .
As a result many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did .
But retail energy prices declined 0.9 % in September .
Though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year .
Still some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind .
It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem argued Edward Yardeni chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York .
In both 1987 and 1988 consumer prices rose 4.4 % .
A run-up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7 % annual rate in the first five months of this year but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4 % .
Mr. Yardeni predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices .
The bottom line is it seems to me that the economic environment has become very very competitve for a lot of businesses he said .
Back in 1987-88 business was operating at fairly tight capacity so businesses felt they could raise prices .
Now he said a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand .
The mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance .
The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's 6.9 % plunge that day .
In the past several days however the U.S. 's central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets .
Analysts say Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy .
Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate consumer prices still rose only 0.2 % in September .
Transportation costs actually fell 0.5 % and housing costs gained only 0.1 % .
Apparel prices rocketed up 1.7 % but that was after three months of declines .
Medical costs continued their steep ascent rising 0.8 % after four consecutive months of 0.7 % increases .
Car prices another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month still showed declines at the consumer level .
They dropped 0.4 % as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers .
Food prices rose 0.2 % for the second month in a row far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year .
Separately the Labor Department reported that average weekly earnings rose 0.3 % in September after adjusting for inflation following a 0.7 % decline in August .
All the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations .
Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department 's consumer price index for September .
After watching interest in the sport plummet for years the ski industry is trying to give itself a lift .
Across the country resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical-music concerts to attract new customers .
Some have built health spas business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more to do than ski .
And this week the industry 's efforts will go national for the first time when it unveils a 7 million advertising campaign .
Such efforts unheard of only a few years ago are the latest attempts to revive the sagging 1.76 billion U.S. ski industry .
Since the start of the decade lift-ticket sales have grown only 3 % a year on average compared with 16 % annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s .
Last season lift-ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years .
By some estimates nearly a fourth of all U.S. ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early '80s .
Competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undoing of many resorts .
But another big problem has been the aging of baby boomers .
Skiing after all has mainly been for the young and daring and many baby boomers have outgrown skiing or have too many family responsibilities to stick with the sport .
In its new ad campaign created by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Inc. Chicago the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people .
One 60-second TV spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes senior citizens minorities families with children even a blind skier .
Ski school is great cries out a tot bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope .
You 'll never know 'til you try says a black skier .
We used to show some hot-dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff says Kathe Dillmann a spokeswoman for the United Ski Industries Association the trade group sponsoring the campaign .
Ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety .
But the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she tries to get up from a fall .
We wanted to show it 's okay if you fall says Ms. Dillmann .
Most people think if you slip you 'll wind up in a body cast .
The ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers normally they only run ads hyping their own products and facilities .
But in these crunch times for the ski industry some resorts such as the Angel Fire Red River and Taos ski areas in New Mexico have even started shuttle-busing skiers to each other 's slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts .
Many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business .
Since 40 % of skiers are parents many slopes are building nurseries expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids .
Vail Colo. now has a playland that looks like an old mining town kids can ski through and pan for fool 's gold .
For 15 they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment with dinner without mom and dad .
A few years ago parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children .
Most parents who had to go through that never came back says Michael Shannon president of Vail Associates Inc. which owns and operates the Vail and nearby Beaver Creek resorts .
To make skiing more convenient for time-strapped visitors several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies .
In one phone call ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations buy lift tickets rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons .
And resorts are adding other amenities such as pricey restaurants health spas and vacation packages with a twist .
During Winter Carnival week for example visitors at Sunday River in Maine can take a hot-air balloon ride .
People these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar says Don Borgeson executive director of Angel Fire N.M. 's Chamber of Commerce .
The ski industry hopes to increase the number of skiers by 3.5 million to about 21.7 million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions .
But some think that 's being overly optimistic .
For one thing it may be tough to attract people because skiing is still expensive a lift ticket can cost up to 35 a day and equipment prices are rising .
And most vacationers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursions .
An American Express Co. survey of its travel agents revealed that only 34 % believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports as opposed to 69 % who think that warm-weather sports will be the deciding factor .
Even if they could bring in that many new skiers I do n't know if the industry could handle that kind of an increase says I. William Berry editor and publisher of the Ski Industry Letter in Katonah N.Y .
Most people will come on the weekend the slopes will be overcrowded and then these new skiers wo n't come back .
They did n't play the third game of the World Series on Tuesday night as scheduled and they did n't play it on Wednesday or Thursday either .
But you knew that did n't you .
They are supposed to play the game next Tuesday in Candlestick Park here .
The theory is that the stadium damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake will be repaired by then and that peo
