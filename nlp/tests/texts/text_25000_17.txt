hat the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks Citibank N.A. Citicorp or any affiliate thereof .
In other words if there 's a problem do n't expect Citibank to come to the rescue .
The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency .
That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received .
That also is n't easy .
Take the credit enhancements which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company .
The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities .
Nor does it cover the entire portfolio .
Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue .
Still they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim .
But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper .
When you buy an asset-backed issue you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties .
If a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of say its loans to Third World nations that could also affect the ratings liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports .
Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions .
But despite the credit enhancements despite the high ratings some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets .
At a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times .
At the very least a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find that is Treasurys .
That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities as well as make it tougher to unload the latter .
But it could be much worse .
Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues .
For one thing credit-card loans are unsecured .
In addition they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession .
A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds says Craig Corcoran of Davis\/Zweig Futures Inc. an investment advisory firm .
What about triple-A-rated asset-backed issues .
Nope we still say to stick with Treasurys Mr. Corcoran replies .
Ratings he notes are subject to change .
All this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people .
And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. of what he calls DeVoe 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1 More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations scams and frauds of all time .

IF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence it would probably be a one-word sentence Diversify .
Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc. serious investors have taken that advice to heart .
Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal 's poll providing an in-depth look at their portfolios .
Those portfolios are remarkably diversified .
By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area be it stocks bonds or real estate .
For example about 88 % of Journal readers owned stock down slightly from 91 % in a similar poll last year .
But only 17.5 % said they had more than half their money in the stock market .
Similarly 57 % of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund and 33 % own municipal bonds .
But only 6 % to 7 % of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives .
The poll conducted Aug. 7-28 also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics .
It found them in a cautious but not downbeat mood .
Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire 951 replied .
The response rate more than 63 % allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence .
The results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors though .
Journal readers are relatively affluent with a median household income of between 75,000 and 99,000 .
Nearly half of the respondents 47 % said their investment portfolio was worth 250,000 or more and 17 % said it was worth 1 million or more .
The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago .
For example 12 % of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months .
Last year only 8 % were expecting a recession .
An additional 56 % of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months .
Only 42 % of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth .
Apparently the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much .
A slim majority 51 % think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989 .
Their verdict on real estate is almost the same .
Some 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months .
By contrast only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold .
Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control .
Even though only 12 % actually predicted a recession many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance .
Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession .
For the most part the changes were slight .
The two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who do n't believe in trying to predict the markets about 31 % and investors who do n't expect a recession about 15 % or are unsure if and when a recession might come about 22 % .
A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents .
Most own two to 10 stocks and buy or sell no more than three times a year .
Some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year only 57 % had sold any .
But the lurking shadow of 1987 's stock-market crash still seems dark .
About 33 % considered another crash likely while about 63 % said one is unlikely .
Those percentages hardly changed from the previous year 's poll .
And the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual .
About 60 % of them said they would ordinarily have at least 25 % of their money in stocks .
But as of August only 50 % actually had stock-market investments of that size .
Most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll .
But it appears that many Journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon .

Moody 's said it expects Valley National of Phoenix Ariz. to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets and from high loan-loss provisions .
Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage .
That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage .
Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies said Noel D. Matchett a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc. Silver Spring Md .
It may well be that theft of business data is as serious a strategic threat to national security as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms said Michelle Van Cleave the White House 's assistant director for National Security Affairs .
The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association a joint industry-government trade group .
Any secret can be pirated the experts said if it is transmitted over the air .
Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder .
They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait .
You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time Mr. Matchett said adding It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught .
The only way to catch an electronic thief he said is to set him up with erroneous information .
Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year most are n't yet taking precautions the experts said .
By contrast European firms will spend 150 million this year on electronic security and are expected to spend 1 billion by 1992 .
Already many foreign firms especially banks have their own cryptographers conference speakers reported .
Still encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy .
One expert whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers for example doubling as foreign spies .
Moreover he said technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been erased from a computer 's memory .
He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read .
No personal computer not even the one on a chief executive 's desk is safe this speaker noted .
W. Mark Goode president of Micronyx Inc. a Richardson Texas firm that makes computer-security products provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev 's campaign for greater openness known commonly as glasnost .
Under Mr. Gorbachev Mr. Goode said the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications .
He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East .
Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company which had n't been invited to submit a bid .
The Soviets ' eavesdropping paid off however because they got the contract .
The University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp .
The University said the two companies agreed to spend 25 million Canadian dollars 21.3 million over 10 years on research at Canadian universities if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine maker .
It said 10 million would go to the University of Toronto .
Ciba-Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of 866 million for Connaught and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of 942 million .
The University is seeking an injunction against the Merieux bid arguing that Connaught 's predecessor company agreed in 1972 that Connaught 's ownership would n't be transferred to foreigners .
The university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if Ciba-Geigy and Chiron are successful with their lower bid .
It said the new agreement would replace the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover .
Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught this accord would enhance research and development in Canada said James Keffer the university 's vice president of research .
Ciba-Geigy is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and Chiron is based in Emeryville Calif .
In a statement Jacques-Francois Martin director general of Merieux said the French company is still determined to acquire Connaught .
While he did n't comment directly on the pact between Ciba-Geigy and the university he said Merieux can transfer new products and technologies to Connaught more rapidly than other companies not currently producing and marketing vaccines who can only promise this for some years in the future .

Row 21 of Section 9 of the Upper Reserved at Candlestick Park is a lofty perch only a few steps from the very top of the stands .
From my orange seat I looked over the first-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the World Series .
It was five in the afternoon but that was Pacific time .
Back in New York the work day was already over so I did n't have to feel guilty .
Even still I did feel self-indulgent and I could n't help remembering my father 's contempt for a rich medical colleague who would go to watch the Tigers on summer afternoons .
This ballpark the Stick was not a classic baseball stadium too symmetrical too much bald concrete .
And it did n't have the crowded wild intimacy of Yankee Stadium .
But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me liked it that they 'd brought their children found it charming that true citizens of the state of the future they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event .
Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history .
The broadcasters were after all documenting the game ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick .
Why not watch or hear your experience historicized while you were living it .
The day was saturated with the weight of its own impending history .
Long lines of people waited to buy special souvenir World Series postcards with official postmarks .
Thousands of us had paid 5 for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on Series trivia its historical photographs of great moments in Series past and its instructions in English and Spanish for filling in the scorecard .
Pitcher = lanzador .
Homerun = jonron .
Players ran out on the field way below and the stands began to reverberate .
It must be a local custom I thought stamping feet to welcome the team .
But then the noise turned into a roar .
And no one was shouting .
No one around me was saying anything .
Because we all were busy riding a wave .
Sixty thousand surfers atop a concrete wall waiting for the wipeout .
Only at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what was going on .
Then I remembered the quake of '71 which I experienced in Santa Barbara in a second-story motel room .
When the swaying of the building woke me up I reasoned that a I was in Southern California b the bed was moving c it must be a Magic Fingers bed that had short-circuited .
Then I noticed the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what had happened .
What should I do .
Get out of the possibly collapsing building to the parking lot .
But the lot might split into crevasses so I had better stand on my car which probably was wider than the average crevasse .
Fortunately the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood .
At the Stick while the world shook I thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different .
If I survived I would have achieved every journalist 's highest wish .
I was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment .
What was my angle .
How would I file .
All these thoughts raced through my head in the 15 seconds of the earthquake 's actual duration .
The rest is of course history .
The Stick did n't fall .
The real tragedies occurred elsewhere as we soon found out .
But for a few minutes there relief abounded .
A young mother found her boy who had been out buying a hotdog .
The wall behind me was slightly deformed but the center had held .
And most of us waited for a while for the game to start .
Then we began to file out to wait safely on terra firma for the opening pitch .
It was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the Stick that I really understood the point of all those Walkmen and Watchmen .
The crowd moved in clumps clumps magnetized around an electronic nucleus .
In this way while the Stick itself was blacked out we kept up to date on events .
Within 15 minutes of the quake itself I was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the Bay Bridge .
Increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before I got to my car .
And by then expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the gridlocked parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black plume of smoke we saw on the northern horizon .
Darkness fell .
But the broadcasts continued through the blacked-out night with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in Oakland and firefighting in the Marina district .
By then our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of listeners and viewers .
Everyone at the Stick that day had started out as a spectator and ended up as a participant .
In fact the entire population of the Bay Area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience .
The reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters .
The outstanding example of this was the motorist on the Bay Bridge who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway .
The tape was on tv before the night was out .
Marshall McLuhan you should have been there at that hour .
Investors who received Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions .
The first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank except for the page numbers .
Rather than printing devils Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market .
The plunge made Shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date .
In fact last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week .
Shearson a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co. did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so We decided to kill our strategy pieces says Jack Rivkin the head of Shearson 's research department .
The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary and that 's why it purged its pages .
Investors recalled that Shearson last week had been a
