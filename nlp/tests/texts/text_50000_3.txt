to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients ' money .
Alarmed state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners .
Industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards too they 're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine .
But reform has n't taken hold yet .
The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days says Scott Stapf director of investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Association .
An admittedly limited survey by NASAA whose members are state securities-law regulators found that between 1986 and 1988 fraud and abuse by financial planners cost 22,000 investors 400 million .
The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons a compulsive gambler or two various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother .
What 's more the losses they and the others caused are just what we are stumbling over says Mr. Stapf adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected .
So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners .
Nobody can estimate the toll but John Gargan a Tampa Fla. planner and head of one trade group the International Association of Registered Financial Planners thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is humongous far greater than that from crookery .
His group like others wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners .
Surveying all this some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all .
For most investors the benefits just are n't worth the risks says Barbara Roper who follows financial-planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America a consumer-advocacy organization based in Washington .
She concedes that such a position is unfair to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it .
She says her group used to give tips on selecting planners check educational and experience credentials consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus but found that even some people who took these steps were still getting ripped off .
The bad news however has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning .
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business .
But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners IAFP the industry 's biggest trade group is still nearly triple what it was in 1980 and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well .
An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners and the pool of capital they influence is enormous .
A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months .
The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult if not impossible to regulate .
Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as investment advisers people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity .
The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers about the same as in 1980 even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade .
Currently a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years .
A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years .
It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem says Kathryn McGrath director of the SEC 's division of investment management .
So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers which operates in the brokerage business .
Such an organization could among other things set minimum standards for competence ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules .
The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with .
Mr. Schwartz the puckish planner from Englewood Colo. says that allowing the business to police itself would be like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank .
Mr. Gargan the Tampa planner who heads one trade group favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff .
Mr. Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP the major industry organization .
When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners Mr. Gargan 's group was excluded .
That may be because Mr. Gargan smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group enrolled his dog Beauregard as a member of the IAFP .
Then he sent the pooch 's picture with the certificate of membership it was made out to Boris Bo Regaard to every newspaper he could think of .
The states have their own ideas about regulation and certification .
NASAA the organization of state securities regulators is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states .
It requires financial planners to register with states pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest .
The most common conflict involves compensation .
NASAA estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they recommend .
The issue Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments or the ones that garner the biggest commissions .
In 1986 the New York attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp. an Albany financial-planning firm that had invested 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors .
In its notice of action the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into balanced investment portfolios instead the attorney general alleged the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings coins and Florida condos .
Those investments paid big commissions to First Meridian payments investors were never told about the attorney general alleged .
Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted .
In practice the attorney general alleged in an affidavit if an investor had access to cash the chances of being turned down by First Meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month Club .
And the attorney general added First Meridian 's president Roger V. Sala portrayed himself as a financial expert when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma work as a real-estate and insurance salesman and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth .
First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general .
Harry Manion Mr. Sala 's attorney says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general 's contentions about First Meridian 's business practices are incorrect .
As for Mr. Sala 's qualifications the snooty attorneys for the state of New York decided Mr. Sala was n't qualified because he did n't have a Harvard degree says Mr. Manion .
Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common .
Two such actions both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta could be particularly embarrassing to the industry both name J. Chandler Peterson an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP as defendant .
One suit filed by more than three dozen investors charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest .
Those companies in turn paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees the suit alleges .
The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale Ariz .
One plaintiff a doctor testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician the privilege of making additional investments with Mr. Peterson .
In affidavits each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned .
Mr. Peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors .
Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots he opened up his briefcase and dumped 1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors says Myron Diebel the bank 's president .
He said he wanted to show the color of his money recalls Mr. Diebel .
Bank officials however showed him the door and the sale never came off .
According to the suit Mr. Peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment .
They want it back .
Mr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits saying he prefers to save such responses for court .
But he does say that all of his activities have been entirely proper .
On the suit by the limited partners he says he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs .
The suit he adds is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people .
Rearding the suit over the bank bid Mr. Peterson says it is filled with inflammatory language and half truths .
He declines to go into specifics .
Mr. Peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a sign of the times in which people generally are more prone to sue .
I do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation he says .
Mr. Peterson also says he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore .
He now calls himself an investment banker .
In many scams or alleged scams involving planners it 's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm 's way .
Using it would n't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner .
Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies If it sounds too good to be true it probably is .
Certificates of deposit do n't pay 23 % a year for example but that did n't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner .
Now they 're losers and he 's in jail in Mobile County .
CDs yielding 40 % are even more implausible especially when the issuing bank in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator but investors fell for that one too .
And the Colorado planner who promised to make some of his clients millionaires on investments of as litle as 100 .
Never mind .
You already know the answer .
Mr. Emshwiller is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Los Angeles bureau .
At the ritzy Fashion Island Shopping Center the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy Southern California beach community disembark from their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs for another day of exercising their credit cards .
They root among the designer offerings at Neiman-Marcus and Bullocks Wilshire .
They stroll through the marble-encased corridors of the Atrium Court .
They graze at the Farmers Market a combination gourmet food court and grocery store while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies .
The beautiful look of wool croons the show 's narrator slightly Victorian in its influence .
Meanwhile in the squat office buildings that ring Fashion Island the odds are good that someone is getting fleeced .
Law-enforcement authorities say that at any given time a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here .
They seem to like these industrial parks says Kacy McClelland a postal inspector who specializes in mail fraud .
We call them fraud farms .
Welcome to that welter of contradictions known as Newport Beach .
This city of more than 70,000 is known for sunshine yachts and rich residents .
It is also known as the fraud capital of the U.S. dubbed by investigators and the media as the Cote de Fraud .
How does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for low-lifes .
Clearly the existence of the former lures the latter .
The places renowned for breeding bunco like the Miami neighborhood known as the Maggot Mile and Las Vegas 's flashy strip of casinos invariably offer fast cars high rollers glamorous women and lots of sunshine .
You do n't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in Green Bay or Buffalo .
Con men hate snow .
Newport Beach fits the scam artists ' specifications perfectly .
What more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for .
Nothing seems hard here .
The breezes are soft the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily .
Nightlife is plentiful .
Moreover ostentation is appreciated .
The median price of homes is 547,000 more than 9,000 vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest pleasure-boat harbor .
Blondes cocaine and Corvettes mutters Mr. McClelland .
That 's what they 're after .
The rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability .
One reason they use Newport Beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses says David Katz a U.S. attorney who until recently headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force .
Newport Beach is known in Rhode Island for having a lot of rich people .
No wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here from phony tax-sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders .
But above all this is the national headquarters for boiler-room operators those slick-talking snake-oil salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish .
Because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest .
I 've heard that there is 40 billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year Mr. McClelland says .
If that 's true Orange County has to be at least 10 % of that .
And most of the truly big scams in Orange County seem to originate in Newport Beach or one of the other well-heeled communities that surround this sliver-like city that hooks around a point of land on the California coast south of Los Angeles .
In fact sophisticated big-bucks boiler-room scams are known generically among law-enforcement types as Newport Beach operations .
That contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as Hollywood scams .
Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot .
The investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals .
In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses caused by employees due to dishonesty destruction or disappearance according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month .
Thus falsely reassured investors sent 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses the indictment charges .
Douglas Jones an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr. the chairman and president of Capital Trust says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors .
There were some business deals that went bad Mr. Jones says but no intent to defraud .
Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars .
Traditionally boiler rooms operate on the cheap since few if any customers ever visit their offices .
Indeed the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space near the boiler room .
But says Mr. Katz the U.S. attorney the interesting thing about Newport Beach operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices with plush furnishings .
When we go there it 's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses .
The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately .
Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals .
Mr. Valentine who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle an island in Newport 's harbor according to investigators .
With the 3 million received from investors he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits .
It 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas Mr. Katz says .
All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element .
Vincent M Ciavarella regional manager of Property Management Systems insists he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co. the owner and developer of the project .
Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided incomplete financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators are not easily detectable .
Investigators stress that building owners are victims too since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent .
Richard Luehrs president of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce calls boiler rooms a negative we wish we could get rid of .
Actually we do n't get much negative publicity about this he insists except for the press who write about it .

YOU WENT to college and thought you got an education .
Now you discover that you never learned the most important lesson How to send your kids to college .
True when you went to college there was n't that much to learn .
Stick some money in an interest-bearing account and watch it grow .
Now investment salesmen say it 's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your toddler a ticket to Prestige U. in 18 years .
In short throw away the passbook and go for the glory .
The reason is cost .
Nothing in the annals of tuition readied parents for the 1980s .
Tuitions at private colleges rose 154 % in the 10 years ended in June of this year that 's twice the 77 % increase in consumer prices for the same period .
A year at Harvard now goes for 19,395 .
By 2007 when this year 's newborns hit campus a four-year Ivy League sheepskin will cost 300,000 give or take a few pizzas-with-everything at exam time .
Stanford MIT and other utmosts will cost no less .
So what 's a parent to do .
Some investment advisers are suggesting in effect a bet on a start-up investment pool maybe even on margin .
Others prefer deep-discount zero-coupon bonds .
Still others say Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund .
You 're not going to make it in a 5 % bank account says James Riepe director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price .
To get the necessary growth adds Murray Ruffel a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group you need to go to the stock market .
In other words a little volatility never hurt .
It never hurt anyone that is unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to .
Or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid 's tuition .
That 's the dilemma for today 's parent .
Although many experts are advising risk no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off .
Help may be on the way .
The antitrust division of the Justice Department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools .
Fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s .
And then there 's always State U .
But parents ' craving for a top-rated education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine .
Belatedly aware of public concern lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes .
Their message explicit or implicit is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore .
Forget about Treasury bills or a money-market fund .
The latest wave of marketing is instructive .
Several outfits including the Financial Programs Franklin and T. Rowe Price mutual-fund groups and the Edward D. Jones brokerage house are advertising college planner tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly .
The calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of 8 % annually a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one place the stock market .
Most of the mailers are free but Denver-based Financial Programs sells for 15 a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice .
The figures are shocking .
To build a nest egg that would pay for Stanford when a current first-grader reaches college age parents would need to set aside 773.94 a month for 12 years .
They can cut this to 691.09 a month if the investing keeps up through college .
And they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier when mother and child come home from the hospital .
Plugging a cheaper college into the formulas still does n't generate an installment most people can live with .
Using a recent average private-school cost of about 12,500 a year T. Rowe Price 's planner prescribes 450 monthly if the plan begins when the child is six .
Since the formula assumes an 8 % before-tax return in a mutual fund there would also be 16,500 in taxes to pay over the 12 years .
Not everyone is so pessimistic .
People are basically peddling a lot of fear says Arthur Hauptman a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington .
He takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution which reduces most parents ' burden substantially .
Still he says it 's no bad thing if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more .
The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income he says .
That 's crazy .
His advice Do n't panic .
Parents he says should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford .
Half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal he adds .
That way parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition .
Mr. Hauptman reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages .
He favors either an all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds .
In their anxiety however parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes .
They have laid out about 1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bonds so far offered by Connecticut Illinois Virginia and eight other states .
And they have bought about 500 million in prepaid-tuition plans offered in Michigan Florida and Wyoming .
The prepaid plans take payment today usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow .
The baccalaureate bonds tax-free offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity seem to be tailor-made for college savers .
Like other zeros they pay all their interest at maturity meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when Junior graduates from high school .
Their compounding effect is also alluring .
In June Virginia sold bonds for 268.98 that will pay 1,000 in 2009 .
But Richard Anderson head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives at Columbia University a research group partly financed by the federal government says zeros are particularly ill-suited .
Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up .
That wo n't matter if they are held to maturity but if for any reason the parents need to sell them before then there could be a severe loss of principal .
Had zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time aiming for their children 's 1988 enrollment they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years Mr. Anderson figures .
Most other bonds however would probably not have fared much better .
The prepaid plans may be a good bet provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure .
Issuing states generally limit the guarantees to in-state institutions however and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools .
Two private groups are seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval for plans that could be more broadly transferable .
Mr. Anderson wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan .
The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee .
Prepayments much like mutual-fund purchases are pooled for investment .
Sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns .
But buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so .
One problem is that the Internal Revenue Service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable .
The colleges as educational institutions had hoped that would n't be the case .
Based on historical rates of return Mr. Anderson reckons a 100 % stock portfolio indexed to the market would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century .
But sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market .
And they 're leaning more toward fixed income whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases .
I 'm not sure they 're going to make it work says Mr. Anderson .
What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions .
Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack .
Not so Michigan .
Its plan is set up as an independent agency .
The state says there 's no worry investment returns combined with fees and the gains from unused plans will provide all the cash it needs .

AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County Miss. Allen D. Tharp of Isola was one of the best known and most enterprising .
He sold quarter-inch fingerlings to stock other farmers ' ponds and he bought back one-pound-or-so food-fish that he live-hauled to market along with his own whiskery crop .
And he nearly always bought and sold for cash .
Along the way Mr. Tharp omitted a total of 1.5 million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years .
The returns landed in the hands of an Internal Revenue Service criminal investigator Samuel James Baker .
Mr. Baker interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers live-haulers and processors throughout the South before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales in pounds and dollars by Mr. Tharp and others .
Unknown to Mr. Tharp he had fouled his net on a special IRS project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes .
Confronted with the evidence Mr. Tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined 5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison .
He also owes a lot of back taxes interest and civil fraud penalties .
A lot of taxpayers out there are n't as paranoid as one might think .
Federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation on the basis of occupation high income type of income or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or exaggerate deductions .
Many professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters dentists who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised racehorses on their days off .
Mail-order ministers have been squelched .
Now television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny .
The IRS recently won part of its long-running battle with the Church of Scientology over exemptions when the U.S. Supreme Court held that members ' payments to the church were n't deductible because the members received services in return .
IRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers entertainment producers masons roofers and taxi owners .
Small businesses in general account for almost 40 % of unreported personal income the IRS has said .
Once such abuses become so pervasive the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them .
San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula not because IRS agents envy their life styles .
Many openings for mass cheating such as questionable tax shelters and home offices have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them .
Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals .
And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers .
Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony who gets a deduction must report the former spouse 's Social Security number .
Passport applicants now must give Social Security numbers enabling the IRS to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns .
But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention .
In most cases the IRS says these projects are local or regional rather than national and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among say factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses .
The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects according to Marshall V. Washburn deputy assistant commissioner for examination .
Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail but they can make life miserable in other ways for one by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence failure to file a return and the like .
The targeted audit groups include direct sellers people who sell cosmetics housewares and other items door to door or at home parties and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes .
Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips people who engage in large cash transactions and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax .
And now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return and which dependents turn out to be deceased .
Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back .
It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs Mr. Washburn says .
The study provided criteria for singling out returns of potentially noncompliant taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part-time business .
The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill N.J. who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields .
For 1984 they reported gross income of 1,647 from Amway sales offset by expenses totaling 16,746 including car costs of 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of 5,088 .
The Tax Court did n't believe that the Rubins who earned 65,619 in their regular jobs treated the sideline as a real business and derived merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits from it .
The Direct Selling Association a trade group points out that its members which include Amway Corp. cooperate with the IRS to distribute tax-compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject .
The independent-contractor project which began in 1988 involves about 350 IRS agents .
In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 reports Raymond P. Keenan assistant commissioner for collection they examined about 13,000 employers assessed more than 67 million in delinquent employment taxes and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors .
The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions mostly paid by small firms .
Many workers especially professionals want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees ca n't .
But many others who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation become tipsters for the IRS says Jerry Lackey who manages the IRS project 's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando .
Firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't he says .
In his area Mr. Lackey continues the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction doing framing drywall masonry and similar work .
But a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them including physicians and receptionists as independent contractors .
The IRS assessed the clinic 350,000 in back payroll taxes .
It assessed nearly 500,000 against a cruise-ship company that carried about 100 deckhands cooks bartenders entertainers and other employees as self-employed independents .
Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an 80 million computer system in 1985 .
The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses from exchange agreements with the IRS 24 other states and two Canadian provinces and even from phonebook Yellow Pages .
Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer they single out high-income groups looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns .
The state has combed through records relating to architects stockbrokers lawyers in the New York City area construction workers from out of the state and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states especially Florida which has no personal income tax .
Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state doctors dentists and accountants says Frederick G. Hicks director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs .
The department has collected over 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution .
In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns it squeezed 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident .
We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project Mr. Hicks declares .

In finding good news in Berkeley 's new freshman admissions plan The Privileged Class editorial Sept. 20 you 're reading the headline but not the story .
The plan indeed raises from 40 % to 50 % the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria .
But that does n't mean half of the students attending Berkeley will be admitted this way .
The plan is talking about applicants admitted not students who enroll .
Since the yield from this top slice of applicants is relatively low boosting admits from 40 % to 50 % will boost registrants from about 31 % to 38 % of the class .
In addition perhaps 5 % of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials narrowly missed gaining them admission in the first category .
But against that combined increase of 12 % in students chosen by academic criteria the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades test scores and supplemental points for factors such as high-school curriculum English-language proficiency and an essay .
This category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of registrants .
The plan thus will decrease by 22 % for a net loss of 10 % the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria .
Who will take over these places .
The plan creates a new category of students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds a concept not yet defined and gives them about 10 % of the class .
One of the plan 's authors has defended the socioeconomic disadvantage category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race .
Perhaps it does .
But the new category does not replace or reduce Berkeley 's broad racial preferences .
Nor will students from racial-minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative-action target for their group .
The plan thus places a large new affirmative-action program based on socioeconomic disadvantage on top of the existing program based on race .
The role of academic criteria in choosing Berkeley 's freshmen can only decline as a result .

This is a story about suckers .
Most of us know a sucker .
Many of us are suckers .
But what we may not know is just what makes somebody a sucker .
What makes people blurt out their credit-card numbers to a caller they 've never heard of .
Do they really believe that the number is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to being a grand-prize winner .
What makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door .
Or an interest in a retirement community in Nevada that will knock your socks off once it is built .
Because in the end these people always wind up asking themselves the same question How could I be so stupid .
There are unfortunately plenty of answers to that question and scam artists know all of them .
These people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person tick says Kent Neal chief of the economic-crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney 's Office in Fort Lauderdale Fla. a major haven for boiler rooms .
Once they size them up then they know what buttons to push .
John Blodgett agrees and he ought to know .
He used to be a boiler-room salesman peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins .
There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways he says .
The most obvious pitch of course is the lure of big returns .
We 're all a little greedy .
Everyone is vulnerable says Charles Harper associate regional administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Miami .
These guys prey on human frailties .
While the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells they often do n't in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore .
The overnight success story is part of our culture and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people says Michael Cunningham an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville .
Other people are making it overnight and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along .
Adds Spencer Barasch branch chief for enforcement at the SEC in Fort Worth Texas Why do people play the lottery when the odds are great against them .
People are shooting for a dream .
Clearly though scam artists have to be a bit more subtle than simply promising millions the psychology of suckers is n't simply the psychology of the greedy .
There 's also for instance the need to be part of the in-crowd .
So one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing .
Between 1978 and 1987 for instance SH Oil in Winter Haven Fla. sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents while turning away numerous other eager investors .
The owner of the company Stephen Smith who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office .
Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed the suit alleged .
Such schemes says Tony Adamski chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington D.C. appeal to investors ' desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity .
At times salesmen may embellish the inside information with the notion that this is some slightly shady slightly illegal investment the person is being included in says Mr. Cunningham .
In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others .
It also adds to the mystery of the venture .
Mr. Blodgett the boiler-room veteran believes that for many investors the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement .
Once people got into it I was allowing them to live a dream he says .
He phoned them with updates on the investment such as funny things that happened at the well that week he says .
You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives .
Mr. Blodgett who was convicted in Florida state court of selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive is now on probation .
He says he has quit the business and is back in school majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology .
For some investors it 's the appearances that leave them deceived .
The trappings of success go a long way wearing the right clothes doing the right things says Paul Andreassen an associate professor of psychology at Harvard .
Conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment .
People honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot he says .
Paul Wenz a Phoenix Ariz. attorney says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery .
But Mr. Wenz who says he lost 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and 39,000 in another says a salesman used a business-venture approach with him sending investment literature a contract limiting the firm 's liability and an insurance policy .
When he visited the company 's office he says it had all the trappings of legitimacy .
Still others are stung by a desire to do both well and good says Douglas Watson commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department 's bunko-forgery division .
Born-again Christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do-gooder investment pitches .
But hardly the only ones The scams promise among other things to help save the environment feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children .
Psychologists say isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud .
Scam artists seek out such people or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves .
For instance salesmen may counter a man 's objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking Who wears the pants in your family .
Or an investor who wants his accountant 's advice may be told You seem like a guy who can make up his own mind .
Often con artists will try to disarm their victims by emphasizing similarities between them .
William Lynes a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp. says he and his wife Lily warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from Stuart-James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them he too had once worked with Lockheed .
The Lyneses of Powder Springs Ga. have filed suit in Georgia state court against Stuart James alleging fraud .
They are awaiting an arbitration proceeding .
They say the broker took them out for lunch frequently .
He urged them to refer their friends who also lost money .
Donald Trinen an attorney for the penny-brokerage firm denies the fraud allegations and says the Lyneses were fully apprised that they were pursuing a high-risk investment .
It 's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to ingratiate themselves to their clients says Terree Bowers chief of the major-frauds section of the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles .
We 've seen cases where salesmen will affect the accent of the region of the country they are calling .
Anything to make a sale .
Experts say that whatever a person 's particular weak point timing is crucial .
People may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives .
Sometimes when people are making big changes retiring from their jobs moving to a new area they lose their bearings says Maury Elvekrog a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger-Elvekrog Inc. a Birmingham Mich. investment-counseling firm .
They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time .
They are obviously also more susceptible when they need money retirees for instance trying to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how to pay for a child 's college expenses .
These people are n't necessarily stupid or naive .
Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way says Jerald Jellison a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles .
Nick Cortese thinks that 's what happened to him .
Mr. Cortese a 33-year-old Delta Air Lines engineer invested some 2,000 in penny stocks through a broker who promised quick returns .
We were saving up to buy a house and my wife was pregnant says Mr. Cortese .
It was just before the Christmas holidays and I figured we could use some extra cash .
The investment is worth about 130 today .
Maybe it was just a vulnerable time says Mr. Cortese .
Maybe the next day or even an hour later I would n't have done it .

FOX HUNTING HAS been defined as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible but at least it 's exercise .
At least it has a little dash .
Most of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither drab duties rather than pleasures .
Like trying to buy life insurance for instance an endeavor notably lacking in dash .
Call it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible .
But sooner or later most of us have to think about life insurance just as we often have to think
