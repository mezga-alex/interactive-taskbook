But Burns confesses in an interview That 's not my handwriting .
MC SHIPPING Inc. New York declared an initial quarterly of 60 cents a share payable Nov. 15 to shares of record Oct. 30 .
The announcement boosted the charter-shipping company 's shares which closed at 15.125 up 1.25 a share in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange .
The company which went public in May intends to pay dividends from available cash flow the amount may vary from quarter to quarter .
Ever since the hotly contested America 's Cup race last year the famous yachting match has run into more rough sailing out of the water than in it .
Now that a key member of the San Diego Yacht Club team is splitting off to form his own team even more competition lies ahead .
Peter Isler the winning navigator in the past two America 's Cup challenges has split from the team led by Dennis Conner skipper of the victorious Stars & Stripes to form his own team for the next contest in 1992 .
And in addition to a crack team of sailors Mr. Isler has lined up some real brass to help him finance the syndicate .
Isler Sailing International 's advisory board includes Ted Turner Turner Broadcasting chairman and a former Cup victor Peter G. Diamandis head of Diamandis Communications and Joseph B. Vittoria chairman and chief executive of Avis Inc .
His steering committee includes other notable businessmen including the California investor and old salt Roy E. Disney .
We have the structure people and plan Mr. Isler said in a statement .
Now the first order of business is raising enough money to keep his team afloat a new yacht will cost about 3 million alone and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to 25 million for a Cup challenge .
The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the San Diego Yacht Club should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the New Zealand challengers ' 90-foot monohull .
In September a New York appellate court overturned a state judge 's ruling that awarded the Cup to the New Zealand team .
Pending an appeal by the New Zealand team led by Michael Fay the finals for the next Cup challenge are scheduled to be held in mid-1992 in San Diego .
But because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the suit Mr. Conner 's team has done little to begin gearing up to defend its title .
If you do n't know what the rules of the game are it 's hard to start your fund-raising or design said Dana Smith an official with Team Dennis Conner .
The Conner team wo n't be able to negotiate with corporate sponsors until the suit is resolved and the race site is determined Mr. Smith said and the syndicate 's budget could easily reach 30 million .
But spokesmen for both Mr. Isler and Mr. Conner say the formation of the new syndicate has to do with Mr. Isler 's desire to skipper his own team and begin planning now rather than any falling out between the two sportsmen .
Mr. Smith and a spokesman for the America 's Cup Organizing Committee insist that the added competition for the defender 's spot will only improve the race .
Missouri farmer Blake Hurst writing in the fall issue of the Heritage Foundation 's Policy Review about the proposed location of a hazardous-waste incinerator in his county Of course I 'd rather have a computer software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator .
But I 'd also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms I 've seen and smelt in these parts .
An incinerator is also probably better than having nobody next door on our farm there are four unoccupied houses .
On my four-mile drive to farm headquarters each morning I drive by another four empty houses .
A community of abandoned farmsteads failing businesses and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one .
The loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural Missouri is hardly of national importance except for this If the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem can not be built in Atchinson County what hope have we for dealing with the wastes our economy produces .
After all farmers here work with hazardous chemicals every day many of them the same chemicals that would have been destroyed in the incinerator .
We know they are dangerous but if handled with care their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment .
Just because Stamford Conn. High School did nothing when its valuable 1930s mural was thrown in the trash does n't mean the city no longer owns the work of art a federal judge ruled .
The mural now valued at 1.3 million according to appraisers was tossed in a trash heap in 1971 by workers who were renovating the building .
The 100-foot-long mural painted by James Daugherty in 1934 was commissioned by the federal Works Project Administration .
After the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned Stamford graduate it eventually was turned over to Hiram Hoelzer a professional art restorer .
Throughout the 1970s Stamford school and city officials made no effort to locate the mural .
Apparently the officials did n't even know the mural was missing until 1980 when a researcher found that the painting was in Mr. Hoelzer 's studio and questioned school officials about it .
In 1986 Stamford officials thanked Mr. Hoelzer for taking care of the mural and demanded he return it as soon as possible .
Mr. Hoelzer however sued Stamford claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long to reclaim it .
But Judge Louis L. Stanton of federal court in Manhattan ruled that the city could n't be faulted for waiting too long because it did n't realize until 1986 that its ownership of the painting was in dispute .
The judge also ruled that the painting was n't abandoned because officials did n't intend for it to be thrown away and were unaware that the workmen had discarded it .
Mr. Hoelzer did n't return phone calls seeking comment on the judge 's decision .
The judge ordered that a hearing be held Nov. 17 to determine how much the city should pay Mr. Hoelzer for his services .
Mary E. Sommer corporate counsel for Stamford said the city has discussed several possible plans for displaying the mural which portrays various scenes from the Great Depression .
She said the mural preserves an era in Stamford and in our country when this type of work was being done .
The prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the Soviet Union is keeping up its dizzying October buying binge of U.S. corn .
Those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the U.S. Agriculture Department announced that the Soviets had bought 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn bringing their U.S. corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons .
In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade the corn contract for December delivery jumped 5.75 cents a bushel to settle at 2.44 a bushel .
The Soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected the Soviet Union to buy this fall the season in which it usually buys much of the corn it imports from the U.S. .
That pace is causing some analysts to speculate that the Soviet Union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons .
One sign that more Soviet purchases are possible is that U.S. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts .
That sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn .
By some estimates several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn .
By buying futures contracts these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver .
Rumors of Soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts .
Among other things the Agriculture Department is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the Soviet Union .
On top of all this corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the Midwest harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of Indiana and Ohio .
The harvest delays however are expected to be temporary .
Balmy temperatures are forecast for next week said Robert Lekberg an analyst at Farmers Grain & Livestock Corp. Chicago .
Many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently harvested crop to grain elevator companies .
The heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally .
Wheat futures prices rose slightly .
In other commodity markets yesterday PRECIOUS METALS Futures prices declined .
A number of developments were negatively interpreted by traders .
December delivery gold fell 1.80 an ounce to 370.60 .
December silver eased 2.7 cents an ounce to 5.133 .
January platinum was down 3.60 an ounce at 491.10 .
One price-depressing development was the lower-than-expected increase of only 0.2 % in the consumer price index for September an analyst said .
He noted that the core inflation rate which excludes food and energy was also low at 0.2 % .
Other news that weighed on the market Initial unemployment claims rose by 62,000 last week American Telephone & Telegraph Co. will reduce its managerial staff by 15,000 through attrition the oil market turned weaker there was n't any investor demand for bullion and the dollar strengthened during the day putting pressure on gold .
Also the analyst said economic circumstances are such that both South Africa and the Soviet Union the principal gold and platinum producers are being forced to continue selling the metals .
Both are in great need of foreign exchange and South Africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments he said .
Putting it all together we have a negative scenario that does n't look like it will improve overnight he said .
COPPER Futures prices recovered in quiet trading .
The December contract rose 1.50 cents a pound to 1.2795 .
That contract fell a total of 5.75 cents during the first three days of this week mostly in reaction to last Friday 's stock market plunge which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the U.S. economy and thus reduced demand for copper a leading industrial metal .
In recent days however there has been increased purchasing of copper in London an analyst said .
Some of this buying was by Japan which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea Highland Valley mine in British Columbia and the Cananea mine in Mexico which are major shippers to Japan .
The increasing likelihood that Cananea and Highland Valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing but even if any of these mines begin operating soon their output wo n't be significant until at least the end of the year analysts note .
So one analyst said even though the long-term production problems may be easing there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three months when inventories will remain relatively low .
ENERGY Crude oil prices ended mixed .
West Texas Intermediate for November delivery fell 14 cents a barrel to 20.42 .
But so-called outer month contracts finished higher .
For instance December contracts for WTI rose 17 cents to 20.42 .
Most energy futures opened lower following Wednesday 's market downturn .
But a flurry of late trading yesterday beefed up prices .
Heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well .
Melvin Belli 's San Francisco law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after Tuesday 's earthquake .
In the first 25 minutes after his office 's telephone service was restored yesterday morning 17 potential clients had called seeking the services of the self-proclaimed King of Torts .
Mr. Belli like many other personal-injury lawyers suspects that the earthquake which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city 's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time .
Suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms contractors and developers as well as against local-government agencies .
But lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge .
Experts on California tort law say protections afforded government agencies in such cases are pretty ironclad .
Even claims against individuals and companies face significant roadblocks .
The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an act of God .
For now says Laurence Drivon president-elect of the 6,000-member California Trial Lawyers Association the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued or whether they have liability or not .
We still have people wandering around in a daze in San Francisco worrying about whether it 's going to rain tonight .
But that wo n't stop plaintiffs ' lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering .
In San Francisco they argue an earthquake was a near certainty .
Therefore engineering firms construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard and government agencies can be held accountable for failing to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster if negligence can be proven .
My prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting says Stanley Chesley a well-known Cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer .
From what he saw on television Mr. Chesley points out that Interstate 880 which collapsed and killed more than 200 commuters suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever .
He adds that they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the San Andreas Fault .
The flamboyant and publicity-conscious Mr. Belli says he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the Bay Bridge and the interstate approaching it .
We wo n't know until the smoke clears but yes we 're looking into it he says .
Mr. Belli says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage .
Mr. Belli who was at Candlestick Park for the World Series Tuesday night says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse .
Defense lawyers perhaps understandably say that plaintiffs ' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually .
A lot of this is going to be code-related says Ignazio J. Ruvolo a construction law specialist at Bronson Bronson & McKinnon a San Francisco law firm .
Plaintiffs he says will argue that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards .
But if defendants can prove that they met San Francisco 's stringent building codes that 's probably going to protect them Mr. Ruvolo says .
Government entities continues Mr. Ruvolo could be protected by the California Government Tort Liability Act .
Under the statute agencies are provided defenses that normally are n't available in the private sector Mr. Ruvolo says .
The legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public entities to liability .
Built into the statute are so-called design immunities which are likely to protect government agencies according to Mr. Ruvolo and Richard Covert a lawyer with the California Department of Transportation which oversees the damaged Bay Bridge .
The state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards says Mr. Covert .
He believes those defenses might well apply to the Bay Bridge collapse .
Nevertheless he adds I would n't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the Bay Bridge .
If there 's going to be a race to the courthouse it has n't started yet .
Mr. Covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday and Mr. Belli 's courtyard was strewn with bricks .
Wednesday Mr. Belli 's staff was n't permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety .
He said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town-house office and helped victims apply for federal aid free of charge .
In a news release issued by Mr. Drivon the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims .
The association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is unethical .
What 's in a name .
Apparently a lot according to the British firm of Deloitte Haskins & Sells .
The British firm has begun court proceedings in London to prevent the use of the name Deloitte by Deloitte Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross & Co. in England and the rest of the world .
The British Deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of Deloitte and Touche world-wide and joined Coopers & Lybrand .
John Bullock senior partner of Deloitte in the U.K. said the decision to start these proceedings has n't been taken lightly .
Mr. Bullock said the British firm has used the name Deloitte since 1845 .
In the U.S. Deloitte Haskins & Sells was known as Haskins & Sells until 1978 when it added the Deloitte name of its British affiliate .
John C. Burton an accounting professor at Columbia University 's Graduate School of Business said there 's a lot of emotion involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in England where accounting predates the U.S. .
Although accountants are n't noted as being deeply emotional they really hold it all in said Mr. Burton former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
J. Michael Cook chairman of Deloitte Haskins & Sells International said he believes the legal action by the British firm to be without merit .
Mr. Cook said that last June the international executive committes of Deloitte and Touche agreed to a world-wide merger .
The merger is proceeding according to plan except as to the withdrawal of the Deloitte U.K. firm he said .
Partners at other accounting firms say that the Deloitte firm in the U.K. is filing the suit to get even with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm for keeping major auditing work in England .
General Motors Corp. a Deloitte audit client for example has agreed to keep its annual 18 million world-wide audit and associated tax work with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm to be known as Deloitte & Touche in the U.S. .
In England this would mean that the British Deloitte would lose revenue for its audit of GM 's Vauxhill unit .
The defection of Deloitte 's affiliates in Britain and the Netherlands to Coopers & Lybrand will make Coopers one of the biggest accounting firms in Europe rivaling KPMG Peat Marwick there .
Although Coopers has n't been courted by other major accounting firms for a merger it is benefiting greatly from fallout from the Deloitte-Touche merger .
In New York Harris Amhowitz general counsel of Coopers said Coopers was aware of the litigation but he declined further comment .
He also declined to comment on the name that Coopers would use in England if Deloitte UK won its litigation to keep its name .
Coopers uses the Coopers & Lybrand name world-wide .
William Bennett the White House drug-policy director accused local officials in the Washington area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers .
Politics has essentially put up a roadblock to finding sites for new federal prisons Mr. Bennett said at a news conference called to report on his emergency assistance program for the capital .
Without more space to incarcerate convicted criminals he added we will not win the war on drugs .
Mr. Bennett declared in April that he would make Washington a test case for how the Bush administration would aid cities afflicted by heavy drug trafficking and violence .
The drug czar claimed that enforcement efforts are working here albeit at a slower and more halting pace than we would like .
He acknowledged however that Washington 's drug-related murder rate is intolerably high .
The prisons are too crowded .
Drugs continue to be sold openly around schools parks and housing projects .
Mr. Bennett declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease Washington 's problem .
But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state .
Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city .
In a letter to Mr. Bennett 's office released yesterday Washington 's city administrator Carol Thompson complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital .
Referring to Mr. Bennett 's claim that the federal government would provide 97 million in emergency federal support Ms. Thompson wrote Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure .
Of his successes in Washington Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates .
He also noted that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration has established a federal-local task force responsible since April for 106 arrests and more than 2 million in seizures of drug dealers ' assets .
The Defense Department has lent the Washington U.S. attorney 10 prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has provided crime laboratory facilities and training he added .
What if it happened to us .
In the wake of the earthquake in California and the devastation of Hurricane Hugo many companies in disaster-prone areas are pondering the question of preparedness .
Some particularly in West Coast earthquake zones are dusting off their evacuation plans checking food stocks and reminding employees of what to do if emergency strikes .
Others say they feel confident that steps they 've already taken would see them through a disaster .
Preparedness involves more than flashlights and fire alarms these days .
Some big companies have teams of in-house experts focusing on safety and business resumption .
Many companies in the path of potential disaster have set up contingency offices in safe regions hoping they can transport employees there and resume operations quickly .
That means making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm 's way .
Some businesses like Disneyland claim that even if they became isolated in a crisis they would be able to feed and care for their people for as long as five days .
Self-sufficiency has to be the cornerstone of your plan says Stephanie Masaki-Schatz manager of corporate emergency planning at Atlantic Richfield Co. in Los Angeles .
If you do n't save your critical people you wo n't be able to bring up your vital business functions .
Although ARCO 's head office more than 300 miles from the epicenter was n't affected by this week 's tremors Ms. Masaki-Schatz used the occasion to distribute a three-page memo of Earthquake Tips to 1,200 ARCO employees .
You need to capitalize on these moments when you have everyone 's attention she says .
It was a good reminder that we all need to prepare prior to an event .
The ARCO memo urges employees to keep certain supplies at work such as solid shoes and heavy gloves to clear debris .
It also recommends that employees be aware of everyday office items that could be used for emergency care or shelter .
Among the suggestions Pantyhose and men 's ties could be used for slings while removable wooden shelves might aid in breaking through office walls .
ARCO maintains an office in Dallas that would take over if payroll operations in Pasadena were disrupted .
Two months ago the company set up a toll-free number based outside California to handle queries from employees about when they should report back to work after an earthquake or other disaster .
The ARCO plan takes into account such details as which aspects of business are busier at certain times of the year .
This way depending on when a quake might strike priorities can be assigned to departments that should be brought back on line first .
At Hewlett-Packard Co. the earthquake came just as the company was reviewing its own emergency procedures .
We were talking about scheduling a practice drill for November says Joan Tharp a spokeswoman .
Then we had a real one in the afternoon .
The Palo Alto Calif. computer maker scrambled to set up a special phone line to tell manufacturing and support staff to stay home Wednesday .
Sales and service employees were asked to report to work to help Bay area clients who called with computer problems .
Hewlett-Packard also called in its systems experts to restore its own computer operations .
That means we can accept orders and begin getting back to normal says Ms. Tharp .
Prompted by an earlier California earthquake as well as a fire in a Los Angeles office tower Great Western Bank in the past year hired three emergency planners and spent 75,000 equipping a trailer with communications gear to serve as an emergency headquarters .
Although officials of the savings and loan a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. used some of their new plans and equipment during this week 's quake they still lost touch for more than 24 hours with 15 branches in the affected areas not knowing if employees were injured or vaults were broken open .
Some people flat out did n't know what to do says Robert G. Lee vice president for emergency planning and corporate security at Great Western .
As it turned out bank employees were n't hurt and the vaults withstood the jolts .
Still says Mr. Lee We need to educate people that they need to get to a phone somehow some way to let someone know what their status is .
Some companies are confident that they 're prepared .
Occidental Petroleum Corp. holds regular evacuation drills and stocks food oxygen and non-prescription drugs at checkpoints in its 16-story headquarters .
The company also maintains rechargeable flashlights in offices and changes its standby supply of drinking water every three months .
We feel we are doing everything we can an Occidental spokesman says .
Walt Disney Co. 's Disneyland in Anaheim Calif. stocks rescue equipment medical supplies and enough food and water to feed at least 10,000 visitors for as long as five days in the event that a calamity isolates the theme park .
The park also has emergency centers where specially trained employees would go to coordinate evacuation and rescue plans using walkie-talkies cellular phones and a public-address system .
The centers are complete with maps detailing utility lines beneath rides and safe havens where people can be assembled away from major structures .
Vista Chemical Co. with three chemical plants in and near Lake Charles La. prepares for every hurricane that enters the Gulf of Mexico says Keith L. Fogg a company safety director .
Hurricane Hugo an Atlantic storm did n't affect Vista .
But two other major storms have threatened operations so far this year most recently Hurricane Jerry this week .
Because hurricanes can change course rapidly the company sends employees home and shuts down operations in stages the closer a storm gets the more complete the shutdown .
The company does n't wait until the final hours to get ready for hurricanes .
There are just tons of things that have to be considered Mr. Fogg says .
Empty tank cars will float away on you if you get a big tidal surge .
Still Vista officials realize they 're relatively fortunate .
With a hurricane you know it 's coming .
You have time to put precautionary mechanisms in place notes a Vista spokeswoman .
A situation like San Francisco is so frightening because there 's no warning .
Former Democratic fund-raiser Thomas M. Gaubert whose savings and loan was wrested from his control by federal thrift regulators has been granted court permission to sue the regulators .
In a ruling by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans Mr. Gaubert received the go-ahead to pursue a claim against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas for losses he suffered when the Bank Board closed the Independent American Savings Association of Irving Texas .
Mr. Gaubert who was chairman and the majority stockholder of Independent American had relinquished his control in exchange for federal regulators ' agreement to drop their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan .
As part of the agreement Mr. Gaubert contributed real estate valued at 25 million to the assets of Independent American .
While under the control of federal regulators Independent American 's net worth dropped from 75 million to a negative 400 million wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert 's real estate contribution and his stock in the institution .
Mr. Gaubert 's suit to recover his damages was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney of Dallas under the Federal Tort Claims Act which offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees .
Earlier this week a Fifth Circuit appellate panel upheld Judge Maloney 's dismissal of Mr. Gaubert 's claim as a shareholder but said the judge should reconsider Mr. Gaubert 's claim for the loss of his property .
It may depend on whether there was an express or implied promise that the federal officials would not negligently cause the deterioration of Independent American the court wrote .
Mr. Gaubert 's lawyer Abbe David Lowell of Washington D.C. says the impact of the ruling on other cases involving thrift takeovers will depend on the degree of similarity in the facts .
I do n't know if this will affect one institution or a hundred Mr. Lowell says .
It does establish a very clear precedent for suing the FHLBB where there was none before .
MAITRE'D CLAIMS in suit that restaurant fired her because she was pregnant .
In a suit filed in state court in Manhattan the American Civil Liberties Union is representing the former maitre 'd of the chic Odeon restaurant .
The suit which seeks compensatory and punitive damages of 1 million alleges that the firing of Marcia Trees Levine violated New York state 's human-rights law .
Among other things the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy .
The suit alleges that Ms. Levine was fired after she refused to accept a lower paying less visible job upon reaching her sixth month of pregnancy .
Ms. Levine told her employer that she was pregnant in February a month later the suit says the restaurant manager told Ms. Levine that she would be demoted to his assistant because he felt customers would be uncomfortable with a pregnant maitre 'd .
Kary Moss an attorney with the ACLU 's Women 's Rights Project said They wanted a svelte-looking woman and a pregnant woman is not svelte .
They told her We do n't hire fat people and we do n't hire cripples .
And pregnant women are fat .
Ms. Moss said Ms. Levine secretly taped many conversations with her bosses at the Odeon in which they told her she was being fired as maitre 'd because she was pregnant .
Paul H. Aloe an attorney for Odeon owner Keith McNally denied the allegations .
He said Ms. Levine had never been fired although she had stopped working at the restaurant .
The Odeon made a written offer to Marcia Levine on July 10 to return to work as the maitre 'd at the same pay same hours and with back pay accrued he said .
Mr. Aloe said the Odeon has no policy against hiring pregnant people .
LAWYERS IN Texas 's biggest bank-fraud case want out in face of retrial .
Lawyers representing five of the seven defendants in the case say their clients can no longer afford their services .
The trial of the case lasted seven months and ended in September with a hung jury .
The defendants were indicted two years ago on charges that they conspired to defraud five thrifts of more than 130 million through a complicated scheme to inflate the price of land and condominium construction along Interstate 30 east of Dallas .
The defense lawyers three of whom are solo practitioners say they ca n't afford to put their law practices on hold for another seven-month trial .
Some of the lawyers say they would continue to represent their clients if the government pays their tab as court-appointed lawyers .
Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Hart of Dallas says the government will oppose any efforts to bring in a new defense team because it would delay a retrial .
FEDERAL JUDGE ALCEE HASTINGS of Florida facing impeachment received an unanticipated boost yesterday .
Sen. Arlen Specter R. Pa .
urged acquittal of the judge in a brief circulated to his Senate colleagues during closed-door deliberations .
Among other things the brief cited insufficient evidence .
Sen. Specter was vice chairman of the impeachment trial committee that heard evidence in the Hastings case last summer .
A former prosecutor and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Sen. Specter is expected to exercise influence when the Senate votes on the impeachment today .

New York Times Co. 's third-quarter earnings report is reinforcing analysts ' belief that newspaper publishers will be facing continued poor earnings comparisons through 1990 .
The publisher was able to register soaring quarter net income because of a onetime gain on the sale of its cable-TV system .
However operating profit fell 35 % to 16.4 million .
The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines lower earnings from the forest-products group and what is proving to be a nagging major problem continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times the company 's flagship daily newspaper .
In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange New York Times closed at 28.125 a share down 37.5 cents .
Analysts said the company 's troubles mirror those of the industry .
Retail advertising which often represents half of the advertising volume at most daily newspapers largely is n't rebounding in the second half from extended doldrums as expected .
At the same time newspapers are bedeviled by lagging national advertising especially in its financial component .
Dow Jones & Co. recently reported net fell 9.9 % a reflection in part of continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine .
We expect next year to be a fairly soft year in newspaper-industry advertising said John Morton an analyst for Lynch Jones & Ryan .
Next year earnings will hold steady but we just do n't see a big turnaround in the trend in advertising .
John S. Reidy an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said The Times faces the same problem of other publishers linage is down .
It will be hard to do handstands until real linage starts heading back up .
In the quarterly report Arthur Ochs Sulzberger New York Times Co. chairman and chief executive officer said negative factors affecting third-quarter earnings will continue .
Analysts agreed with company expectations that operating profit will be down this year and in 1990 .
Mr. Sulzberger said the scheduled opening of a new color-printing plant in Edison N.J. in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs .
With the Edison plant coming on line next summer the Times is facing some tough earnings comparison in the future said Peter Appert an analyst with C.J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell .
But many newspapers are facing similar comparisons .
The sale of the company 's cable franchise brought an after-tax gain of 193.3 million part of which will be used to reduce debt .
The company also has a stock-repurchase plan .
Analysts said they were impressed by the performance of the company 's newspaper group which consists of the Times 35 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in the International Herald Tribune group operating profit for the quarter increased slightly to 34.9 million from 34.5 million on flat revenue .
Drexel Burnham 's Mr. Reidy pointed out that profits held up in a tough revenue environment .
That 's a good sign when profits are stable during a time revenue is in the trough .
Investors celebrated the second anniversary of Black Monday with a buying spree in both stocks and bonds .
But the dollar was mixed .
Stock and bond investors were cheered by last month 's encouragingly low inflation rate .
This news raised hopes for further interest-rate cuts .
Treasury-bond prices immediately rallied setting the stock market rolling from the opening bell .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average up about 60 points in mid-afternoon finished with a gain of 39.55 points to 2683.20 .
That brought the average 's cumulative gain this week to about 114 points .
Since the 1987 crash the industrials have soared more than 54 % and the widely watched market barometer is about 4 % below its record high set earlier this month .

The government said consumer prices rose only 0.2 % last month .
Economists expected twice as large an increase .
That news plus recent signs of economic sluggishness greatly increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease credit further which in turn would be good news for stocks investment managers say .
I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt said Garnett L. Keith Jr. vice chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of America one of the nation 's largest institutional investors .
Fed officials probably wo n't drive down rates immediately Mr. Keith said .
Despite the inflation news several Fed officials still fear consumer-price pressures will intensify because they insist the economy is stronger than generally believed .
But Wall Street analysts expect further signs of economic weakness in government reports during the next few weeks .
If so that will cinch the case for another shot of credit-easing within a month or so .
That in turn is expected to persuade banks to cut their prime lending rate a benchmark rate on many corporate and consumer loans by half a percentage point to 10 % .

Tuesday 's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that has n't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that at least at the federal level political ticket splitting has been on the rise over the past half century .
In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20 % of the nation 's congressional districts choose a different party 's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives .
Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 % .
As we know voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress .
In every presidential election over the past half century except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress .
Prior to 1932 the pattern was nearly the opposite .
What accounts for the results of recent decades .
A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth .
The theory relies on three assumptions 1 Voters can buy one of two brands when they select their political agents a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .
2 Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office dealing with national issues programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the population at large and attending to local issues constituency service and pork barrel .
3 Republican congressional representatives because of their belief in a minimalist state are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress .
If these assumptions hold voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive at the margin to lean Democratic .
If they put a Republican into office not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from bringing home the bacon to their respective constituencies .
Each legislator after all is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making .
In races for the White House a voter 's incentive at the margin is to lean Republican .
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district\/state such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts\/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits .
The individual voter 's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes .
While this theory is exceedingly simple it appears to explain several things .
First why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe .
Second it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency .
Third the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office .
For example first-term members of the House once the most vulnerable of incumbents have become virtually immune to defeat .
The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 .
Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role spreading the Reagan revolution in national policy making they were more vulnerable to defeat .
Fourth the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office .
Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent .
To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates .
Fifth the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South .
To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office .
Finally the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House .
Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts .
Is there any empirical support for this theory .
Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues .
First economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do .
To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns .
Second if the key assumption is valid Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking .
This is indeed what the data indicate particularly in the case of the House .
The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 .
Finally as shown in the table Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices .
An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 when control of that body changed party hands moreover reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise due to their majority-party status over other resources such as committee staff .
An additional piece of evidence from the Senate Holding other factors constant such as incumbency advantages and regional factors the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder .
Put more simply GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe .
Moreover ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level .
State government is more typically split along Republican-governor\/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse .
A cross-state econometric investigation furthermore reveals that holding other factors constant the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate .
In sum at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation .
Mr. Zupan teaches at the University of Southern California 's business school .
A House-Senate conference approved a nearly 17 billion State Justice and Commerce Department bill that makes federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement after next Oct. 1 .
The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then but beginning in fiscal 1991 the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as 500 million until the total liability of approximately 1.25 billion is paid .
The action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparations first authorized in 1988 .
The action came as Congress sent to President Bush a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated 156.7 billion for the Departments of Labor Education Health and Human Services .
Final approval was on a 67-31 roll call in the Senate which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. Bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women .
Reversing an eight-year federal policy the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest but Mr. Bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother 's life is in danger .
Mr. Bush 's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill .
The measure before the conference yesterday funds the Departments of State Justice and Commerce through fiscal 1990 .
An estimated 1.32 billion is provided for next year 's census and negotiators stripped a Senate-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens .
Elsewhere in the Commerce Department nearly 191.2 million is preserved for assistance programs under the Economic Development Administration .
And in a footnote to the fall of House Speaker James Wright this year the conference voted to rescind 11.8 million in unspent EDA funds for a Fort Worth Texas stockyards project that figured in ethics charges against the former Democratic leader .
Fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies and an 18 % increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission 's budget would be financed entirely by an added 26 million in filing fees .
In an unprecedented step the measure anticipates another 30 million in receipts by having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases a change that is almost certain to increase Pentagon costs in processing personnel and security clearances .
The bill does n't include an estimated 1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for Justice Department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the House .
But yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants .
Similarly the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of 1.6 million each in drug grants or three times the current minimum .
The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency .
Lawmakers scrapped all of a 7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville Spain but agreed elsewhere to 15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger .
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings D. S.C. who also chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the department attached 10 million for an advanced technology initiative including work on high-definition television .
His Republican counterpart Sen. Warren Rudman R. N.H. has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the Legal Services Corp .
An estimated 321 million is provided to maintain the program but Mr. Rudman also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed .
The effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until Oct. 1 next year and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the Food Research and Action Center .
The bill also provides 620.5 million to meet U.S. contributions to international organizations and 80 million for peace-keeping activities .
Both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal 1989 although the amount for peace-keeping shows a 27 % cut from the administration 's request .
