 stabilize .
Consolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year and at least two competitors have announced similar increases .
Truckers are trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting forget about market share and go for higher rates said Michael Lloyd an analyst at Salomon Bros .
And shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can he said .
Air-freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month .
And Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its rates a further 25 % over the next two years .
Such rate increases will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports said Richard Connors a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan .
Ship companies carrying bulk commodities such as oil grain coal and iron ore have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years .
Some bulk shipping rates have increased 3 % to 4 % in the past few months said Salomon 's Mr. Lloyd .
And ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates .
Carriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels .
Ship lines operating in the Pacific plan to raise rates on containers carrying U.S. exports to Asia about 10 % effective next April .

Bob Stone stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination .
Mr. Stone thought the discipline was unfair he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons .
Unable to persuade the manager to change his decision he went to a company court for a hearing .
At the scheduled time Mr. Stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked .
After the three members of the court introduced themselves the chairman of the panel said Go ahead and tell us what happened .
We may ask questions as you go along or we may wait until the end .
No lawyers or tape recorders were present .
The only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists one of whom knew Mr. Stone 's case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture .
Over a cup of coffee Mr. Stone told his story .
He talked about 20 minutes .
When he was through the court members asked many questions then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses .
The chairman promised Mr. Stone a decision within two weeks .
Bob Stone is a fictional name but the incident described is real .
It happened at Northrop Corp. in Los Angeles .
The court is called the Management Appeals Committee or just MAC and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year .
Alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at Federal Express in Memphis the Defense and Underseas Systems divisions of Honeywell in Minneapolis a General Electric plant in Columbia Md. or a number of other companies .
These firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world the rise of what I call corporate due process .
Although corporate due process is practiced today in few companies perhaps 40 to 60 it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry .
In the coming decade a majority of people-oriented companies are likely to adopt it .
Corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons .
It reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex-employees with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations .
It helps to keep out unions .
It increases employee commitment to the company with all that means for efficiency and quality control .
What must your management team do to establish corporate due process .
Here are four key steps 1 .
Make sure you have a strong personnel department .
It must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases .
At Polaroid the Personnel Policy Planning Committee may hear only about 20 cases a year the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages .
At TWA the System Board of Adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists .
At Citicorp the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel 's skill in complaint-resolution .
In a typical year up to 20 % of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment .
In a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle .
2 .
Formally or informally train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's due-process approach .
See that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards for it is the law governing company courts and adjudicators .
Coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately .
In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen .
In the 15 companies I studied reversal rates range on the average from 20 % to 40 % .
3 .
Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator .
A panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and for the panelists mutual support .
An adjudicator system that is an investigator who acts first as a fact-finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts has such advantages as speed flexibility and maximum privacy .
International Business Machines and Bank of America are among the companies using the single-adjudicator approach .
4 .
Make your due-process system visible .
It wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it .
Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints .
On the other hand they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists .
Smith-Kline Beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs .
Naturally one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it .
At IBM the company 's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive .
Federal Express goes further in this respect than any company I know of with both Frederick Smith and James Barksdale chief executive and chief operating officer respectively sitting in on the Appeals Board almost every Tuesday to decide cases .

The Nikkei which reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening surrendered part of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit-taking .
Investors especially dealers do n't want to hold a position over the weekend a trader at Dai-ichi Securities said adding though that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session .

In turmoil caused by the previous Friday 's plunge in New York stocks the Nikkei marked a sharp 647.33-point fall Monday .
But the Nikkei fell an overall 1.8 % in value that day compared with Wall Street 's far sharper 6.9 % drop on Oct. 13 .
The Tokyo market 's resiliency helped participants to regain confidence gradually as they spent more time on analyzing factors that caused the Friday plunge and realized these problems were unique to New York stocks and not directly related to Tokyo .
The Nikkei continued to gain for the rest of the week adding 1017.69 points in four days more than erasing Monday 's losses .
