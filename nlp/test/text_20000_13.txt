he said .
Mr. Schulman said he believes that the roll-out of DEC 's new mainframe will occur somewhat more leisurely than many of his investment colleagues expect .
He said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in December with all of the more sophisticated versions out by June .
For reasons he would n't elaborate on he said he 's sure that schedule wo n't be met meaning less profit impact from the product for DEC in the next few quarters .

Colgate Palmolive Co. reported third-quarter net income rose 27 % bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from U.S. operations .
Colgate said net income for the quarter rose to 76.7 million or 1.06 a share on sales that increased 6 % to 1.3 billion .
In the year-earlier period Colgate posted net income of 60.2 million or 88 cents a share .
Last year 's results included earnings from discontinued operations of 13.1 million or 19 cents a share .
Reuben Mark chairman and chief executive officer of Colgate said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in Latin America the Far East and Europe .
Results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. business he said .
Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal care businesses which include such well-known brands as Colgate toothpaste and Fab laundry detergent jumped more than 40 % the company said .
Mr. Mark attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities .
We 've done a lot to improve U.S. .
results and a lot more will be done Mr. Mark said .
Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company .
Colgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts .
The scope of the improvement in the U.S. business caught some analysts by surprise .
The company 's domestic business especially its household products division has performed poorly for years .
Analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales .
For the nine months net increased 14 % to 217.5 million or 3.09 a share .
Sales rose 7 % to 3.8 billion .
The company earned 191.1 million or 2.79 a share in the year-earlier period .
Colgate 's 1988 net income included 40.1 million or 59 cents a share from discontinued operations .
Colgate sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year .
Separately Colgate Wednesday finalized an agreement with MacroChem Corp. a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in Billerica Mass. to market in the U.S. four of MacroChem 's FDA-approved dental products .
The products sealants and bonding materials used by dentists all contain fluoride that is released over time .
The move is part of a drive to increase Colgate 's business with dentists a company spokeswoman said .
Terms of the agreement were n't given .
USACafes Limited Partnership said it completed the sale of its Bonanza restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of Metromedia Co. for 71 million in cash .
USACafes which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible .
The Bonanza franchise system which generates about 600 million in sales annually represented substantially all of the partnership 's assets .
The sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a Delaware court USACafes said .
The company said it believes the suit is without merit .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes will enable it to save 450 million in the next year .
AT&T also said net income rose 19 % in the third quarter .
AT&T said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments .
AT&T said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program .
AT&T said third-quarter net income grew despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets .
Net income rose to 699 million or 65 cents a share from the year-earlier 587 million or 55 cents a share .
Revenue edged up to 8.9 billion from 8.81 billion .
The latest period 's net was reduced 102 million or nine cents a share for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment .
The results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts who were encouraged by AT&T increasing its operating margin to 13 % from 11 % a year ago because of continued cost-cutting efforts .
Sales of long-distance services an extremely competitive market rose 6.4 % .
But the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products .
Under the amended pension program AT&T managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes .
Managers who retire Dec. 30 will have an additional 15 % added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65 whichever comes earlier .
An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees .
Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months .
This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth said Jack Grubman an analyst with PaineWebber Inc .
But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth .
This is a good move but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are in terms of earnings growth said Joel D. Gross an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette .
Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts it expects in the future .
AT&T said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses .
But the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire .
AT&T said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in Ing .
C. Olivetti & Co. for shares in Cie .
Industriali Riunite an Italian holding company .
For the nine months AT&T said net income was 1.99 billion or 1.85 a share up 19 % from 1.67 billion or 1.56 a share .
Revenue gained 3.1 % to 26.81 billion from 26 billion .
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange AT&T shares closed at 43.375 up 87.5 cents .
When it comes to buying and selling shares Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one .
Every dollar 's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year the firm estimates .
That makes it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
But wait a second .
Westridge Capital is an index fund the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average .
Westridge Capital 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing .
Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer such as Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index and match its performance .
Institutional investors have poured 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns .
These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few active stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers much less beat it .
And the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each 100 of assets a fraction of the cost of active managers .
That 's because computers do most of the work and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs .
But today indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one .
Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average they have developed enhanced indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points .
Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade but the index money has been just sort of sitting there says Seth M. Lynn president of Axe Core Investors Inc. an indexer based in Tarrytown N.Y .
Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money .
Among the souped-up indexing strategies Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks or just a few dozen rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies .
They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks such as smaller companies those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry state or country .
With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 .
Futures and options also make it possible to build synthetic index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market .
One reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing particularly for those plain vanilla funds that mirror the S&P 500 .
There is n't a boatload of big investors out there still waiting to get into indexing says P. James Kartalia vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. Chicago which offers both indexing and active management services .
After tripling in size in the past five years index funds now hold about 20 % of the stock owned by pension funds .
A further problem is razor-thin profits .
Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing and in some cases are just that .
To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free .
It 's like getting a free toaster when you open an account says Axe Core 's Mr. Lynn .
As a result indexers have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money .
And many have been successful as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader Westridge Capital .
Westridge Capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the S&P 500 's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage points over the past four years with the same risk level as holding the S&P 500 stocks according to James Carder the firm 's president .
Strategies vary for Westridge Capital which has 300 million under management .
The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies .
Mr. Carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines .
And in some months he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all .
By their nature our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover Mr. Carder adds .
The more turnover the better for our clients .
Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns .
J. Thomas Allen president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures .
You 're buying the S&P and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it he says .
But some indexers make little or no use of futures saying that these instruments present added risks for investors .
If the futures markets have a problem then those products could have a problem says John Zumbrunn managing director of Prudential Insurance Co. of America 's Investment Index Technologies Inc. unit .
Prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus 5\/100 of a percentage point .
An added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by Prudential .
There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds .
They include LIMITED RISK FUNDS These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains .
Here a fund may promise to pay back say 95 of every 100 invested for a year even if the market goes much lower .
The fund could invest 87 for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8 % to return the guaranteed 95 .
That leaves 13 which could be used to buy S&P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the S&P index .
MANAGER REPLICATION FUNDS Say a big investor is interested in growth stocks .
Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks the portfolio will be maintained by computer reducing both fees and in theory risk because of the large number of stocks .
We see a lot of interest in those kind of things says Frank Salerno a vice president of Bankers Trust .
People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies .
TILT FUNDS This is an index fund with a bet .
Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio .
One simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates this can avoid weak sisters but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds .
Another approach An investor with 100 million might use 75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other 25 million on a favorite group of stocks .
SPECIALIZED FUNDS Indexes can be constructed to serve social goals such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa .
Other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment .
Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System for example has about 130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either Pennsylvania-based or have 25 % of their work forces in the state .
Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month this time 4.2 % while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest .
The Big Board reported that short interest dropped to 523,920,214 shares as of Oct. 13 from 547,347,585 shares in mid-September .
Amex short interest climbed 3 % to 53,496,665 shares from 51,911,566 shares .
For the year-earlier month the Big Board reported 461,539,056 shares indicating a 13.5 % year-to-year rise while the Amex reported 36,015,194 shares a 48 % leap .
Amex short interest has been heading upward since mid-December with increases in each month since then except at mid-July .
Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender .
Short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders .
Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back .
Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging .
The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock .
The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month 's 3.38 .
The ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange 's average trading volume that would be required to convert the total short interest position .
Some analysts suggest however that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions .
Varity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares .

Your Oct. 12 editorial Pitiful Helpless Presidency .
correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3 .
You are absolutely wrong however in opining that this position is some kind of flip-flop something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls .
My position is one founded on both the facts and the law .
Although you may have forgotten public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative .
The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 9 10 and 11 1988 and again on April 4 1988 .
It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega 's criminality and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies .
Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him and to exploit the administration 's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing .
