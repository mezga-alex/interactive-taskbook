ble Marina district which boasts some of the highest home prices in the state .
The district built on landfill suffered heavy quake damage including collapsed buildings .
Yesterday the city demolished two dwellings in the district because of severe structural damage and said as many as 19 of the district 's 350 dwellings might have to be razed .
Brokers agreed with the two-tier price theory .
My gut feeling is that the Marina properties will be affected said Grace Perkins senior vice president at Grubb & Ellis Residential Brokerage Inc .
Neither she nor other real-estate executives and brokers could project how much less Marina properties might bring but she said the two-tier price structure would affect prices for a while .
Mr. Rosen said the quake will revive consumer interest in a little-publicized 1972 state law that requires brokers to disclose to potential buyers how close a property sits to a fault line .
Because of the size of the California market few relocation specialists expect a widespread corporate flight in the quake 's aftermath .
But they said the quake will force some companies to relocate or expand part or all of their operations outside the state .
What you 're going to get is We do n't want to put all of our eggs in one basket ' theory said James H. Renzas president of Location Management Services Inc. a Palo Alto Calif. relocation concern .
Mr. Renzas among others said the quake will prod companies in certain industries like semiconductors computers and aerospace to consider moving operations that involve particularly sensitive machinery to locations outside California .
Because of the quake threat some firms have evaluated what the cost is to shore up their buildings and compared it with the cost of building it elswehere he said .
One Southern California aerospace firm for example two months ago asked Location Management to compare the costs of reinforcing its current building against earthquakes with the cost of building a new structure elsewhere .
A new dwelling would cost 21 million Location Management found compared with 22 million to make the present building earthquake-proof .
The company Mr. Renzas said has n't yet determined what to do .

The Canadian government introduced in the House of Commons legislation to extend federal regulatory authority over provincial government-owned telephone utilities in Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba .
The legislation would open the way for more telephone services and more competition in the telephone business in the three provinces federal officials said .
The federal government initiative follows a recent Canadian Supreme Court decision that held that the major telephone companies in Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba and in the Atlantic coast provinces were interprovincial undertakings and subject to federal legislative authority .
Prior to the ruling the federal government had regulated only the telephone companies in Quebec Ontario British Columbia and the Northwest Territories .
The governments of Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba have strongly opposed federal regulation of their telephone companies .
The extension of federal regulatory authority over telephone utilities in the Atlantic provinces has n't required special legislation because they are investor-owned .

International Business Machines Corp. and MCA Inc. said they agreed to sell their Discovision Associates joint venture to U.S. units of Pioneer Electronic Corp. for 200 million .
The joint venture licenses a portfolio of about 1,400 patents and patent applications relating to optical-disk recording technology .
IBM and MCA formed Discovision in 1979 to make laser-read optical products .
But the partners did n't believe the market for the systems was developing as rapidly as they had hoped .
After reportedly investing 100 million in the business Discovision ceased manufacturing operations in 1982 and sold many of its assets to Tokyo-based Pioneer among others .
Discovision now has world-wide license agreements with major manufacturers covering CD audio disks audio disk players videodisks and videodisk players .
It also licenses optically based data storage and retrieval devices .

Yoshiaki Mitsuoka head of the investment information department at Daiwa Investment Trust & Management said that if New York stocks just fluctuate in or near their current range the Tokyo market will remain firm with a moderately upward trend for the rest of the year .

The federal response to California 's earthquake crisis was marred by coast-to-coast name-calling between the White House and San Francisco 's Mayor Art Agnos .
Mr. Agnos complained that he was ticked off that Vice President Dan Quayle who toured the earthquake site Wednesday did n't schedule a private meeting with him .

And one White House official reported that Mr. Agnos had been very helpful in making arrangements for Mr. Bush 's hastily scheduled trip to California .
Gold and silver broker Preston Semel asked a federal court to halt the Commodity Exchange from imposing a record 550,000 fine on his firm .
The suit filed in federal court in Manhattan also asks that the Comex 's nine-month suspension of Mr. Semel be lifted pending the broker 's appeal of the disciplinary measures .

After slipping on news of a smaller-than-expected U.S. inflation figure the dollar rebounded later in the trading day .
The U.S. unit dipped to a session low against the mark just after the release of the U.S. consumer price index .
The report showed that September consumer prices rose just 0.2 % a smaller increase than expected .
The market had anticipated a 0.4 % rise in the price index .

In Tokyo Friday the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.93 yen up from Thursday 's Tokyo close of 141.55 yen .
Some analysts said the consumer price index reflects a more significant slowdown in the U.S. economy than earlier indicated .
They point out that September 's producer-price index showed a 0.9 % increase .
They noted that because the consumer price index known as the CPI is a more comprehensive measure of inflation and is rising less rapidly than the producer-price index or PPI it could signal further easing by Fed .
Others suggested however that the Fed will hold any changes in monetary policy in check leaving fed funds at around 8 3\/4 % down from the 9 % level that prevailed from July through September .
Kevin Logan chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corp. said that both PPI and CPI climbed around 4 1\/2 % year-to-year in September .
He argued that both CPI and PPI have in fact decelerated since spring .
The Fed wo n't be stampeded into easing Mr. Logan said predicting that for now interest rates will stay where they are .

H&R Block is one of the great success stories of U.S. business .
Oddly enough this presents a problem for the stock .
Some money managers are disenchanted with H&R Block because they suspect the company 's glory days are past or at least passing .
Block 's tax-preparation business is mature they say and some of its diversifications are facing tough competition .
It 's no secret that Block dominates the mass-market tax-preparation business .
The Street knows all about the predictability of its earnings which are headed for a ninth consecutive yearly increase .
The company has consistently earned more than a 20 % annual return on its net worth while many companies would be happy with 15 % .
But the tax-preparation business simply has no more room to grow says Mark Cremonie director of research for Capital Supervisors Inc. a Chicago firm that manages 6.5 billion .

It closed yesterday at 34 3\/4 .
To be sure the stock still has a lot of fans .

I do n't know what the risk is of holding the stock .
Taxes are not going out of business .
Many of his peers feel the same way .
The number of big institutions that own H&R Block shares is 207 and growing according to a midyear tally by CDA Investment Technologies .
Brokerage houses are sweet on H&R Block too .
Zacks Investment Research counts five brokerage houses that consider the stock a buy and four that call it a hold .
None dare say to sell it .
But some money managers are doing just that .
Eugene Sit president of Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis says When we bought it we thought the growth rate was going to accelerate because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer which waits for Uncle Sam 's check .
But neither of those developments did much to juice up growth Mr. Sit says .
He figures Block earnings are now growing at about a 10 % annual rate down from about 14 % the past five years and will grow at an 8%-10 % rate in the
