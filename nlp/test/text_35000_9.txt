tradition Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment .
He hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate and by wavering on this issue and abortion he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides .
Elected to Congress in 1978 the 48-year-old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan .
Like many of his colleagues he did n't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors .
Jack Kemp and the writers Irving Kristol and George Gilder were influences and Mr. Courter 's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current New Jersey GOP governor Thomas Kean in the 1981 Republican primary here .
The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter 's fortunes but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate pro-choice Gov. Kean .
While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government anti-tax agenda in Washington Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey 's budget in his eight years in office .
Kean forces play down any differences with Mr. Courter but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government .
Mr. Courter 's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov. Kean 's own insurance commissioner .
Mr. Courter is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers .
Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head .
He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park .
Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office .
I do n't think we do now he says .
I think we did .
Asked the same question after his appearance Democrat Florio identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today .
When he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization 's 20th anniversary he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in Camden .
Details and Camden are essential Florio .
Elected to Congress as a Watergate baby in 1974 he ran for governor three years later .
In the opinion of many he has n't stopped running since even though he declined a rematch with Gov. Kean in 1985 .
His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge .
With limited budgets for television in a high-priced market Mr. Florio 's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage .
More than ever his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the state .
Auto insurance rates are soaring .
A toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer .
In Monmouth an important swing area Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county clean and green .
Mr. Florio savors this vindication but at age 52 the congressman is also a product of his times and losses .
He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 to increase state revenue he focuses not on taxes but on audits to cut waste .
Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s .
Appealing to a young audience he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead .
The lyric chosen long strange night may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar .
The Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county 's past corruption .
His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater Trenton State College .
Mr. Florio 's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the Webster ruling divides some of his old constituency .
Pasquale Pignatelli an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an Essex County Irish bagpipe band speaks sadly of Mr. Florio .
I am a devout Catholic says Mr. Pignatelli a 40-year-old health officer .
I ca n't support him because of abortion .
Bill Wames Sr. 72 is Catholic too but unfazed by Mr. Florio 's stand on abortion .
A security guard at a cargo terminal he wears a Sons of Italy jacket and cap celebrating The US 1 Band .

Consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate 0.2 % in September pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs the Labor Department reported .
Energy costs which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month continued to decline at the retail level pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs .
The report was the brightest news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than 190 points last Friday .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on the news closing 39.55 points higher at 2683.20 .
Bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall .
But many economists were not nearly as jubilant .
The climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months they warned .
They also said the dollar is leveling off after a rise this summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods .
I think inflation is going to pick up through the fall said Joel Popkin a specialist on inflation who runs an economic consulting firm here .
It has been in what I would describe as a lull for the past several months .
We 've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now said Jay Woodworth chief domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. in New York .
Because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep 6.5 % last month many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too .
As a result many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did .
But retail energy prices declined 0.9 % in September .
Though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year .
Still some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind .
It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem argued Edward Yardeni chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York .
In both 1987 and 1988 consumer prices rose 4.4 % .
A run-up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7 % annual rate in the first five months of this year but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4 % .
Mr. Yardeni predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices .
The bottom line is it seems to me that the economic environment has become very very competitve for a lot of businesses he said .
Back in 1987-88 business was operating at fairly tight capacity so businesses felt they could raise prices .
Now he said a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand .
The mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance .
The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's 6.9 % plunge that day .
In the past several days however the U.S. 's central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets .
Analysts say Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy .
Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate consumer prices still rose only 0.2 % in September .
Transportation costs actually fell 0.5 % and housing costs gained only 0.1 % .
Apparel prices rocketed up 1.7 % but that was after three months of declines .
Medical costs continued their steep ascent rising 0.8 % after four consecutive months of 0.7 % increases .
Car prices another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month still showed declines at the consumer level .
They dropped 0.4 % as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers .
Food prices rose 0.2 % for the second month in a row far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year .
Separately the Labor Department reported that average weekly earnings rose 0.3 % in September after adjusting for inflation following a 0.7 % decline in August .
All the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations .
Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department 's consumer price index for September .
After watching interest in the sport plummet for years the ski industry is trying to give itself a lift .
Across the country resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical-music concerts to attract new customers .
Some have built health spas business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more to do than ski .
And this week the industry 's efforts will go national for the first time when it unveils a 7 million advertising campaign .
Such efforts unheard of only a few years ago are the latest attempts to revive the sagging 1.76 billion U.S. ski industry .
Since the start of the decade lift-ticket sales have grown only 3 % a year on average compared with 16 % annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s .
Last season lift-ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years .
By some estimates nearly a fourth of all U.S. ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early '80s .
Competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undoing of many resorts .
But another big problem has been the aging of baby boomers .
Skiing after all has mainly been for the young and daring and many baby boomers have outgrown skiing or have too many family responsibilities to stick with the sport .
In its new ad campaign created by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Inc. Chicago the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people .
One 60-second TV spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes senior citizens minorities families with children even a blind skier .
Ski school is great cries out a tot bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope .
You 'll never know 'til you try says a black skier .
We used to show some hot-dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff says Kathe Dillmann a spokeswoman for the United Ski Industries Association the trade group sponsoring the campaign .
Ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety .
But the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she tries to get up from a fall .
We wanted to show it 's okay if you fall says Ms. Dillmann .
Most people think if you slip you 'll wind up in a body cast .
The ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers normally they only run ads hyping their own products and facilities .
But in these crunch times for the ski industry some resorts such as the Angel Fire Red River and Taos ski areas in New Mexico have even started shuttle-busing skiers to each other 's slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts .
Many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business .
Since 40 % of skiers are parents many slopes are building nurseries expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids .
Vail Colo. now has a playland that looks like an old mining town kids can ski through and pan for fool 's gold .
For 15 they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment with dinner without mom and dad .
A few years ago parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children .
Most parents who had to go through that never came back says Michael Shannon president of Vail Associates Inc. which owns and operates the Vail and nearby Beaver Creek resorts .
To make skiing more convenient for time-strapped visitors several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies .
In one phone call ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations buy lift tickets rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons .
And resorts are adding other amenities such as pricey restaurants health spas and vacation packages with a twist .
During Winter Carnival week for example visitors at Sunday River in Maine can take a hot-air balloon ride .
People these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar says Don Borgeson executive director of Angel Fire N.M. 's Chamber of Commerce .
The ski industry hopes to increase the number of skiers by 3.5 million to about 21.7 million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions .
But some think that 's being overly optimistic .
For one thing it may be tough to attract people because skiing is still expensive a lift ticket can cost up to 35 a day and equipment prices are rising .
And most vacationers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursions .
An American Express Co. survey of its travel agents revealed that only 34 % believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports as opposed to 69 % who think that warm-weather sports will be the deciding factor .
Even if they could bring in that many new skiers I do n't know if the industry could handle that kind of an increase says I. William Berry editor and publisher of the Ski Industry Letter in Katonah N.Y .
Most people will come on the weekend the slopes will be overcrowded and then these new skiers wo n't come back .
They did n't play the third game of the World Series on Tuesday night as scheduled and they did n't play it on Wednesday or Thursday either .
But you knew that did n't you .
They are supposed to play the game next Tuesday in Candlestick Park here .
The theory is that the stadium damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake will be repaired by then and that people will be able to get there .
Like just about everything else that remains to be seen .
Aftershocks could intervene .
But at least the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side .
It may seem trivial to worry about the World Series amid the destruction to the Bay Area wrought by Tuesday 's quake but the name of this column is On Sports so I feel obliged to do so .
You might be interested to know that baseball not survival appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of 60,000-odd that had gathered at Candlestick at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday a half-hour before game time when the quake struck .
As soon as the tremor passed many people spontaneously arose and cheered as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show .
One fan seated several rows in front of the open upper-deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted We arranged that just for you guys .
I thought and I 'm sure others did You should n't have bothered .
I 'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster a tornado 15 or so summers ago near Traverse City Mich. so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things the urge to talk about them .
Perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into people 's faces and asking how they feel about one calamity or another fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat .
It felt like I was on a station platform and a train went by said one man describing my own reaction .
A women said she saw the park 's light standards sway .
A man said he saw the upper rim undulate .
I saw neither .
Dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding the general inclination was to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played .
I was near the top of the stadium and saw a steel girder bow six feet from where I sat but I stayed put for 10 or 15 minutes confessed a friend .
I guess I thought This is the World Series and I 'm not gon na wimp out .
Here in the Global Village though folks do not stay uninformed for long .
Electrical power was out in still-daylighted Candlestick Park but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful .
Within a few minutes the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear .
Its Richter Scale measurement was reported as 6.5 then 6.9 then 7.0 .
A section of the Bay Bridge had collapsed as had a part of Interstate Highway 880 in Oakland .
People had died .
At 5:40 p.m. scheduled game time having passed some fans chanted Let 's Play Ball .
No longer innocent they qualified as fools .
The stadium was ordered evacuated soon afterward the announcement made over police bullhorns cited the power outage but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend .
Outside I spotted two young men lugging blocks of concrete .
Pieces of Candlestick they said .
The crowd remained good natured even bemused .
TV reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while a few feet away others watched the interviews on their portable TVs .
The only frenzy I saw was commercial Booths selling World Series commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged by fledgling speculators who saw future profit in the items .
The traffic jam out of the park was monumental .
It took me a half-hour to move 10 feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle and an additional hour to reach an inner roadway a half-block away .
The six-mile trip to my airport hotel that had taken 20 minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours .
At my hotel the Westin power was out some interior plaster had broken loose and there had been water damage but little else .
With Garpian randomness a hotel across the street the Amfac had been hit harder A large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away .
The Westin staff had kindly set out lighted candles in the ballroom prepared a cold-cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets .
I fell asleep on the lobby floor next to a man wearing a Chicago Cubs jacket .
I expected him to say I told you so but he already was snoring .
The journalistic consensus was that the earthquake made the World Series seem unimportant .
My response was that sports rarely are important only diverting and the quake merely highlighted that fact .
Should the rest of the Series be played at all .
Sure .
The quake and baseball were n't related unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the 1972 Olympics .
That heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience and seems doomed to repeat it .
Two ironies intrude .
This has been widely dubbed the BART Series after the local subway line and the Bay Bridge Series .
Flags fly at half-staff for the death of Bart Giamatti the late baseball commissioner and now the Bay Bridge lies in ruins .
A Series that was shaping up as the dullest since the one-sided Detroit-over-San Diego go of 1984 has become memorable in the least fortunate way .
Still its edge is lost .
It now will be played mostly for the record and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible without off days .
And I will never again complain about a rainout .
The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers .
But two big New York banks seem to have kicked those chances away for the moment with the embarrassing failure of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. to deliver 7.2 billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp .
For more than a decade banks have been pressing Congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing Wall Street 's lucrative takeover game from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds .
Those expanded powers reached their zenith in July when Bankers Trust New York Corp. provided mergers advice an equity investment and bank loans for the 3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc .
One of the major selling points used by Los Angeles financier Alfred Checchi in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds .
That was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and Washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover .
All 3.35 billion in debt for the deal was supplied by banks .
Charles Nathan co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc. says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs .
But the UAL collapse he says may tell you it 's not going to work that easily .
David Batchelder a mergers adviser in La Jolla Calif. who aided Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis on the bids which put both UAL and NWA in play as takeover candidates this year says that banks have been preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing .
Mr. Batchelder says that in the past banks would normally have loaned 65 % of a total buy-out price with the loans secured by the target company 's assets .
Another 20 % of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans .
Mr. Checchi 's purchase of NWA Mr. Batchelder notes was probably the most aggressive to date with bank debt at 85 % of the purchase price .
But Mr. Batchelder says that Citicorp 's failure to deliver on its promise to raise the UAL bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group is very distressing to potential users of a highly-confident letter from commercial banks .
His client Mr. Davis used just such a letter from Citicorp in pursuing UAL Citicorp later agreed to work with a competing UAL buy-out group .
Executives of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan declined to comment on either the UAL situation or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers .
In the wake of Campeau 's problems prices of junk bonds tumbled throwing into doubt the ability of corporate acquirers to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales .
Mark Solow senior managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. says the falloff in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in structuring takeovers .
But he warns that banks will have to have enough discipline not to make loans that are too risky .
In fact Manufacturers Hanover said in its third-quarter earnings report that fees from syndicating loans to other banks dropped 48 % to 21 million .
We did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor says a bank spokesman .
James B. Lee head of syndications and private placements at Chemical Banking Corp. said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of one-stop shopping for takeover finance .
As evidence he cites yesterday 's arrangement for the final financing of a 3 billion bid for American Medical International Inc. in which Chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor .
Beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers .
Arthur Fleischer Jr. a takeover lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson notes that a political and emotional bias has developed against junk bonds .
One hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was Paramount Communications Inc. in its initial offer to acquire Time Inc. for 10.7 billion or 175 a share .
A Paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial not political drawbacks of junk bonds .
But some observers believe Paramount Chairman Martin Davis wanted to avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for Time .
In the end Mr. Davis used junk bonds so that he could raise Paramount 's bid to 200 a share .
Some Monday-morning quarterbacks said the initial lower bid without junk bonds was a factor in his losing the company .
Time eluded Paramount by acquiring Warner Communications Inc .
The success of the NWA financing and the failure of the UAL deal also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by Japanese banks .
Japanese banks accounted for 50 % of the NWA bank debt according to a report by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner .
But it was broad-scale rejection by Japanese banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy UAL .
Citicorp and Chase are attempting to put together a new lower bid .
Takanori Mizuno chief economist of the Institute for Financial Affairs Inc. a Tokyo research center on finance and economics says The junk bond market became very jittery and there 's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of LBO companies .
Harley-Davidson Inc. filed suit in federal court here alleging that a group that holds 6.2 % of its stock made false deceptive and misleading statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements .
Harley-Davidson 's complaint claims that the group led by investor Malcolm I. Glazer violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15 % of the company 's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filing eventually was made it did n't disclose the group 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law .
Mr. Glazer could n't immediately be reached to comment .
But when Harley last week publicly questioned the legality of the group 's filing procedures the Rochester N.Y. investor said we complied with every law and he denied any wrongdoing .
The Glazer group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in Harley-Davidson or seek representation on the company 's board .
Harley has said it does n't intend to be acquired by the Glazer group or any other party .
Inland Steel Industries Inc. battered by lower volume and higher costs posted a 75 % drop in third-quarter earnings .
The nation 's fourth-largest steelmaker earned 18.3 million or 43 cents a share compared with 61 million or 1.70 a share a year earlier when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing .
Sales fell to 981.2 million from 1.02 billion .
The earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter 's 45.3 million or 1.25 a share .
Moreover the earnings were well below analysts ' expectations of about 1.16 a share .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Inland closed yesterday at 35.875 a share down 1 .
The company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market especially in the automotive sector .
However the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter .
Third-quarter shipments slipped 7 % from the year-ago period and 17 % from this year 's second quarter .
Profit of steel shipped for the company 's steel segment slid to 26 a ton from 66 a ton a year earlier and 57 a ton a quarter earlier .
Analysts noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices for steel products .
Charles Bradford an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar hot-rolled and structural steel .
Structural steel which primarily serves the construction market was especially hurt by a 15 % price drop Mr. Bradford said .
The company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material repair and maintenance and labor costs .
The increased labor costs became effective Aug. 1 under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers union .
Meanwhile the company 's service center segment which saw operating profit drop to 11.5 million from 30.7 million a year ago experienced much of the same demand and cost problems as well as start-up costs associated with a coil processing facility in Chicago and an upgraded computer information system .
Inland Chairman Frank W. Luerssen said the company 's short-term outlook is clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets .
However he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter .
In the first nine months profit was 113 million or 3.04 a share on sales of 3.19 billion compared with 204.5 million or 5.76 a share on sales of 3.03 billion a year earlier .
The seismic activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth .
When things are quiet low volatility the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately .
However when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure the more earthquake-resistant it is the better its chance for survival .
America 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully aftershock-resistant .
Investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information .
That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity .
And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks .
In today 's markets specialists on the New York Stock Exchange and upstairs market makers in the over-the-counter market are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process .
When they halt trading all market liquidity is gone .
And when any component of the market cash futures or options loses liquidity the price discovery system the way prices are determined becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time .
Last Friday the 13th as well as two years ago this week the markets became unlinked .
When that happened seismic tremors of fear much like the shock waves created by an earthquake coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility .
Lack of important needed information can cause fear .
Fear is the father of panic .
Panic frequently results in irrational behavior .
And in financial markets irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe .
When market tremors start it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve buy and sell orders at various prices be made available to all not just to market makers .
Because of a lack of information and access many investors including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed because of their ignorance of important market information .
To add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets a modern electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena and the information that would automatically accompany such access by investors particularly institutional investors .
Contrary to some opinions the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole .
What market makers provide is immediacy a very valuable service .
Liquidity is not a service .
It is a market attribute the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news .
Market makers buy what investors wish to sell their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors and at a profit .
As a result while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker which is micro-liquidity for the investor the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction The unwanted position is still an unwanted position only the identity of the seller has changed .
In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers a result of some post-1987 crash studies also increases market volatility since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time the more selling pressure is overhanging the market .
In an open electronic system any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve buy and sell orders at each price entered by dealers and investors alike and to enter and execute orders .
Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis .
Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field Congress sought and called a national market system not yet achieved almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975 .
Last Friday 's market gyrations did not result in severe aftershocks .
Were we smart or just lucky .
I 'm not certain .
But I am sure we need to maximize our earthquake protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock-damping power to our nation 's markets .
Mr. Peake is chairman of his own consulting company in Englewood N.J .
NOW YOU SEE IT now you do n't .
The recession that is .
The economy 's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up .
So often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane .
For the past seven years investors have had the wind at their backs in the form of a generally growing economy .
Some may have forgotten and some younger ones may never have experienced what it 's like to invest during a recession .
Different tactics are called for as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher .
For those investors who believe or fear that 1990 will be a recession year many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in
