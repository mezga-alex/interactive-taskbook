clamp on credit allowing interest rates to drop a bit after pushing them up for a year .
Sales of new homes rose and inventories of houses which had been climbing dropped .
But last month new construction in all types of homes waned from single-family houses to large apartment complexes .
It 's pretty much weak across the board said Martin Regalia chief economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions .
Mr. Regalia said the industry may be reluctant to step up building at the moment for fear the inventories of unsold homes will increase again .
Another reason for the weakness he said may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in March .
In August rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages started creeping up a bit but they inched down again through September .
Rates have n't really peeled off that much Mr. Regalia said .
We 've kind of settled now into an interest-rate environment that 's fairly high .
Work was begun on single family homes the core of the housing market at an annual rate of 971,000 in September a drop of 2.1 % from the previous month .
That followed a 3.3 % decline in August .
Construction of apartments and other multi-family dwellings slipped 2.2 % to an annual rate of 1,022,000 following a 3.5 % decline in August .
The number of building permits issued for future construction dropped 2.4 % to a 1,296,000 annual rate after rising 3.7 % in August .
All the numbers were adjusted for normal seasonal variations in building activity .
The housing starts numbers however are one of the least precise of the government 's economic indicators and are often revised significantly as more information is collected .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. posted a sharp third-quarter turnaround from a year earlier but net income would have dropped from the second quarter without a 37 million after-tax gain .
The securities firm posted third-quarter net of 66 million or 64 cents a share compared with a restated year-earlier loss of 3 million or 11 cents a share .
Revenue climbed 25 % to 3.3 billion from 2.6 billion .
The latest period included the gain which was 77 million before tax from the previously announced sale of the institutional money management business of Lehman Management Co .
The 1988 period was restated from net income of 8 million to correct an overstatement in the company 's Boston Co. subsidiary .
In the 1989 second quarter Shearson had net income of 55 million or 54 cents a share .
An average 102.5 million common shares were outstanding in the latest quarter up from 87.1 million .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Shearson shares lost 37.5 cents to 18.125 .
The company said the improved performance from a year ago reflects higher commissions and revenue from marketmaking and trading for its own account .
Commission revenue was 522 million up 49 % .
But industrywide trading activity slowed in September as institutional investors turned cautious and individuals continued to shy away from the market .
Investment banking revenue fell 32 % to 205 million in part reflecting the continued slowdown of the underwriting business .
In the nine months net fell 3 % to 106 million or 98 cents a share from 110 million or 1.05 a share .
Revenue advanced 26 % to 9.6 billion from 7.6 billion .
Two major drug companies posted strong third-quarter earnings in line with profits already reported by industry leaders and analysts ' expectations .
But Pfizer Inc. based in New York reported flat earnings .
Schering-Plough Corp. based in Madison N.J. reported a 21 % rise in earnings as American Home Products Corp. of New York posted an 11 % increase in net .
American Home Products American Home Products said sales and earnings for the third quarter and nine months were at record levels .
Sales for the third quarter increased 6.5 % to 1.51 billion from 1.42 billion .
Sales of health-care products increased 6 % in the third quarter based in part on strong sales of prescription drugs such as Premarin an estrogen-replacement drug and sales of the company 's infant formula .
American Home Products said net income benefited from a lower effective tax rate reflecting a reduction of foreign tax rates and additional operations in Puerto Rico .
Net also was aided by a gain on the sale of the company 's equity interests in South Africa effective Sept. 1 .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday American Home Products closed at 102.25 a share down 75 cents .
Pfizer Pfizer said third-quarter sales increased 4 % to 1.44 billion from 1.38 billion .
The company said net income was flat because of investment in research and development and costs related to launches of several products .
The company said the dollar 's continued strengthening reduced world-wide sales growth by three percentage points .
Pfizer posted its largest gains in healthcare sales up 3 % and consumer products up 23 % .
Sales by the specialty chemicals and materials science segments were flat and sales by the agriculture segment declined 5 % .
In the health-care segment pharmaceutical sales increased 4 % and sales of hospital products increased 1 % .
During the quarter Pfizer received federal approval of Procardia XL a calcium channel blocker approved for both angina and hypertension and Monorail Piccolino used to open obstructed coronary arteries .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Pfizer closed at 67.75 a share up 75 cents .
Schering-Plough Schering-Plough said sales gained 2.7 % to 743.7 million from 724.4 million .
In the period the company completed the sale of its European cosmetics businesses sold a majority interest in its Brazilian affiliate and announced the reorganization of its over-the-counter drug businesses into a new unit Schering-Plough Health Care Products .
These actions did n't affect results because the gain on the sale of the European cosmetics businesses was offset by provisions relating to the Brazil divestiture and drug restructuring .
U.S. pharmaceutical sales rose 15 % led by allergy asthma and cold products dermatological products anti-infectives and anti-cancer products and cardiovascular products .
World-wide consumer product sales declined 12 % primarily because of the European cosmetics sale .
Significantly lower sales of Stay Trim diet aids also were a factor in the drop .
The Maybelline beauty product line had higher sales following a sluggish first half .
In Big Board composite trading Schering-Plough shares fell 75 cents to close at 74.125 .
Swedish auto and aerospace concern Saab-Scania AB said it received a 250 million krona 39 million order from Swiss Crossair one of Europe 's leading regional air companies for five Saab 340B turboprop commuter aircraft .
It is quite unfortunate that you failed so miserably in reporting the Hurricane Hugo disaster .
Your Sept. 27 page-one article Charleston Lost Quite a Lot to Hugo Especially Gentility leaves the impression that the storm was little more than an inconvenience .
The damage reported focused on a select few who owned irreplaceable historic homes on the Battery .
Not mentioned were the 50,000 people rendered homeless and the more than 200,000 out of work for an indeterminable period the 1 billion-plus in losses to homes and personal property on the barrier islands the near and long-term impact on the state 's largest industry tourism not to mention the human suffering .
In centering on the disruption of a few proud local customs such as the historic homes tour and the damage to the antiquities your reporter served to only perpetuate an outdated and stereotypically provincial view of this otherwise thriving port city .
The damage will undoubtedly prove to be one of the epic human and economic disasters of the decade in this country .
David M. Carroll Columbia S.C .
Your story was tasteless and insensitive .
Depicting the people of a traumatized city reeling from a disaster of unprecedented proportions was at the very best ludicrous under the circumstances .
Your narrow focus appears to be a contrived attempt to show the people of that historic city to be doddering fools .
You had to have been blind not to see the scenario there for what it was and is and will continue to be for months and even years a part of South Carolina that has sustained a blow that the Red Cross expects will cost that organization alone some 38 million .

Charleston is historic and aristocratic as your reporter said but not haughty as he suggested .
Charlestonians are instead indomitable and have contributed mightily to the culture and history of our country for more than 300 years .

Affiliated Bankshares of Colorado Inc. said it agreed to sell its 10 % interest in Rocky Mountain Bankcard Systems for 18.5 million to Colorado National Bank of Denver and Central Bank of Denver .
Colorado National is a unit of Colorado National Bankshares Inc. and Central is a unit of First Bank System of Minneapolis .
Affiliated said it expects to record a pretax gain of about 18.5 million from the sale of the credit-card business which should more than offset any reduction in the carrying value of real estate and real-estate loans on its books .
The U.S. Export-Import Bank tentatively decided to guarantee commercial bank financing for the purchase of two Boeing Co. 767 airliners by Avianca Colombia 's international airline at a cost of about 150 million .
The loan guarantee would amount to about 127.5 million or 85 % of the cost of the aircraft .
Because of the size of the proposed loan guarantee the Ex-Im Bank 's preliminary commitment is subject to review by the House and Senate Banking committees .
Ex-Im Bank officials said this review process currently is under way .
Sebastian Guzman Cabrera took over the oil workers union Mexico 's most powerful labor organization only last January .
But even in that short time Mr. Guzman Cabrera has become as controversial in his own way as his deposed predecessor Joaquin Hernandez Galicia known as La Quina .
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari used the army to oust La Quina who reigned for 28 years over a graft-riddled empire that made state-run Petroleos Mexicanos or Pemex one of the world 's most inefficient oil companies .
Now Mr. Guzman Cabrera is facing accusations that he 's as much a company man as La Quina was a crook .
In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union 's role in subcontracting long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings .
And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment .
Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's new order has n't arrived without resistance .
Brawls between union factions still erupt at Pemex installations .
Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas publicly questioned Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's moral quality suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country 's oil a symbol of Mexican nationalism to foreigners .
The 61-year-old Mr. Guzman Cabrera takes such criticisms in stride .
This is n't a new kind of union leadership it 's a new Mexico .
We 're no longer afraid of associating with private or foreign capital he says .
Pemex which produces 40 % of government revenue desperately needs new investment .
Since world oil prices collapsed in 1982 the government has siphoned Pemex 's coffers to make payments on Mexico 's 97 billion foreign debt .
Little money has been returned to upgrade Pemex 's aging facilities .
While the government drains Pemex from above the union has drained it from below .
A bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused Pemex 's operating costs to balloon to 95 cents of each 1 in sales far above the industry norm .
The declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why Mexico has been importing gasoline this year .
Some projections show Mexico importing crude by the end of the century barring an overhaul of operations .
Whatever you tried to change whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners the big obstacle was the old union leadership says oil consultant George Baker .
Enter Mr. Guzman Cabrera who has a clear understanding of where union leaders fit in the pro-enterprise regime of President Salinas .
I 'm the secretary-general if there is one he says greeting a visitor to his office .
Beginning as a laborer in a refinery Mr. Guzman Cabrera put in more than 40 years at Pemex before being pushed into retirement by La Quina after a dispute two years ago .
Though he also long benefited from the system built by La Quina Mr. Guzman Cabrera says union perks had simply gotten out of hand .
They are at the base of all of the problems of corruption he says .
Thus in recent contract negotiations Mr. Guzman Cabrera gave up the union 's right to assign 40 % of all of Pemex 's outside contracts an enormous source of kickbacks .
The union also ceded the 2 % commission it had received on all Pemex maintenance contracts .
The union will keep a 2 % commission on construction projects .
The new contract also eliminates the 15 monthly coupon good only at union-owned grocery stores that was part of the salary of every worker from roughneck to chief executive .
About 9,800 technical workers notably chemists and lawyers were switched to non-union status .
Also because of its reduced capital budget Pemex has phased out about 50,000 transitory construction workers reducing the work force to about 140,000 the union leader says .
Mr. Guzman Cabrera says the union 's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22 % increase in compensation .
But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract .
We are retaking the instruments of administration says Raul Robles a Pemex subdirector .
Pemex officials would n't say how much money the new contract would save the company but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around 500 million a year .
Pemex 's customers also are pleased with the company 's new spirit .
Grupo Desc a big conglomerate has long depended on Pemex petrochemicals to produce plastic packing material .
But when the Pemex plant shut down for an annual overhaul it would never give notice to its customers .
The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations says Ernesto Vega Velasco Desc 's finance director .
This year for the first time Desc and other customers were consulted well in advance of the Pemex plant 's shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience .
Taming the union complements previous moves by the government to attract private investment in petrochemicals which Mexico has been forced to import in large quantities in recent years .
In May the government unveiled new foreign investment regulations that create special trusts allowing foreigners long limited to a 40 % stake in secondary petrochemical companies to own up to 100 % .
Later the government reclassified several basic petrochemicals as secondary products .
But Pemex 's courtship with private companies and especially foreign ones is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938 .
They are preparing the workers for what 's coming foreign control wrote Heberto Castillo a leftist leader .
Mr. Guzman Cabrera and government officials insist that foreigners will be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products .
But the new union leader makes no apologies for Pemex 's more outward-looking attitude .
If we do not integrate into this new world of interdependence sooner or later we 're going to become victims of our own isolation he says .
Couple Counseling Grows to Defuse Stress MORE EXECUTIVES and their spouses are seeking counseling as work and family pressures mount .
Some employers initiate referrals especially if work problems threaten a top manager 's job .
Many couples are like ships passing in the night a communications gulf that sparks problems on the job and at home says psychologist Harry Levinson .
His Levinson Institute in Belmont Mass. has seen in recent years a doubling in the number of executives and spouses at its weeklong counseling program .
Employers foot the bill he says figuring what 's good for the couple is good for the company .
One East Coast manufacturing executive faced with a job transfer his wife resented found that counseling helped them both come to grips with the move .
And the vice president of a large Midwestern company realized that an abrasive temperament threatened his career when his wife confided that similar behavior at home harmed their marriage .
More dual-career couples also are getting help with men increasingly bringing their working wives for joint counseling .
The level of stress for a woman is often so high it 's the husband who says I 'm worried about her says psychologist Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz .
Her Institute for Family and Work Relationships in La Jolla Calif. has noted a doubling in the number of couples seeking help the past two years .
No matter how competent and smart you both are the relationship almost certainly will erode if you do n't have time to talk to have fun and to be sexual says Ms. Shaevitz .
She urges client couples to begin a detoxification period purging social and other nonproductive activities and setting time apart for themselves .
Putting those times on the calendar she says is as important as remembering business appointments .
Power of Suggestion Stronger in Japan HERE 'S ONE more explanation for why Japan is a tough industrial competitor Two of three Japanese employees submit suggestions to save money increase efficiency and boost morale while only 8 % of American workers do .
And the Japanese make far more suggestions 2,472 per 100 eligible employees vs. only 13 per 100 employees in the Data for 1987 from the National Association of Suggestion Systems and the Japan Human Relations Association also indicate that Japanese employers adopt four of five suggestions while their U.S. counterparts accept just one in four .
In Japan small suggestions are encouraged .
Each new employee is expected to submit four daily in the first few months on the job .
U.S. companies tend to favor suggestions that go for the home runs says Gary Floss vice president of corporate quality at Control Data Corp .
That helps explain why American employers grant an average award of 604.72 per suggestion while Japan 's payment is 3.23 .
Still suggestions ' net savings per 100 employees is 274,475 in Japan vs. 24,891 in the U.S. .
U.S. companies developing management teams are wrestling with how to handle individual suggestion systems .
Control Data for one plays down its employee suggestion program because it favors the team-management focus .
Merger Fallout Beware Employee Dishonesty CORPORATE security directors increasingly worry that merger mania spawns a rise in employee dishonesty .
A Security magazine survey places the effect of takeovers and buy-outs among the industry 's 10 biggest challenges .
If it causes management to take their eye off the ball inventory shrinkage is going to be affected says Lewis Shealy vice president for loss prevention at Marshall Field 's the department store chain .
A separate study of the extent of employee misconduct linked general job satisfaction to property loss .
Co-author Richard Hollinger cites what happened at one family-owned company absorbed by a foreign giant .
Pilferage climbed dramatically as many angry employees felt abandoned by the former owners says the University of Florida sociologist .
But top management should watch for other tell-tale signs of employee misdeeds like expense-account fudging and phone misuse .
Security consultant Dennis Dalton of Ventura Calif. thinks mergers often trigger longer lunch hours and increased absenteeism conduct which can sap the bottom line more than thefts .
New management can take several steps to reduce dishonesty .
Most important experts say is to show that a company 's ethical tone is set at the top .
Mr. Dalton also recommends that the chief executive establish a rumor control center and move swiftly to bolster morale .
Consultant John Keller of Southlake Texas urges that top management adopt a tough hands-on approach with very tight controls and monitoring .
And security authority Robert L. Duston favors disciplining all employees who cheat .
Firms Walk Fine Line In Distributing Profits ARE CORPORATE profits distributed fairly .
A survey by Sirota Alper & Pfau a New York consulting firm underscores the difficulty for top management in satisfying employees and investors on that score .
Nearly seven of 10 investors think companies reinvest too little of their profits in the business .
And half the employees surveyed think companies dole out too little to them .
But both see a common enemy About 66 % of employees and 73 % of investors think senior managers get too big a slice of the profit pie .
Bank of New York Co. said it agreed in principle to acquire the credit-card business of Houston-based First City Bancorp. of Texas for between 130 million and 134 million .
The move subject to a definitive agreement is part of a trend by big-city banks that have been buying up credit-card portfolios to expand their business .
Just last month a Bank of New York subsidiary agreed to buy the credit-card operation of Dreyfus Corp. 's Dreyfus Consumer Bank for 168 million a transaction that is expected to be completed by the end of the year .
First City 's portfolio includes approximately 640,000 accounts with about 550 million in loans outstanding .
First City which issues both MasterCard and Visa cards has agreed to act as an agent bank .
At the end of the third quarter Bank of New York 's credit-card business consisted of 2.4 million accounts with 3.6 billion in loans outstanding .
Bank of New York is currently the seventh-largest issuer of credit cards in the First City said that because of increased competition in the credit-card business it had decided it either had to expand its own holdings substantially or sell them .
We think there 's a good prospect that competition is going to get pretty fierce in this market said James E. Day a First City vice president .
We see it becoming a bargain-basement kind of business .
The company estimated that the transaction would enhance its book value which stood at 28.55 a share on Sept. 30 by more than 100 million or about 4 a share .
The company also said the transaction would bolster after-tax earnings by 3.25 a share when completed and boost its primary capital ratio to 7 % from 6.63 % .
First City which recently purchased three small Texas banking concerns said it would use the proceeds to pursue additional expansion opportunities in the Southwest and elsewhere .
With that possibility in mind analysts said the transaction was a positive move for First City .
I think they 'll be able to move faster to make acquisitions in Texas said Brent Erensel an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette .
That 's something they can do very well .
British Airways PLC said it is seeking improved terms and a sharply lower price in any revised bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. following the collapse of a 6.79 billion 300-a-share buy-out bid .
Derek Stevens British Air 's chief financial officer told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report a price of 230 a share is certainly not too low and indicated his company would like to reduce the size of its 750 million cash investment .
He added the airline is n't committed to going forward with any new bid and has n't participated in bankers ' efforts to revive the transaction that collapsed .
We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all .
We 're not rushing into anything .
We do n't want to be party to a second rejection he said adding that coming up with a revised offer could easily take several weeks .
Mr. Stevens 's remarks confirming a report in The Wall Street Journal that British Air wants to start from scratch in any new bid for the nation 's second-largest airline helped push UAL stock lower for the fourth straight day .
UAL fell 6.25 a share to 191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase .
Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 UAL 's pilots planned to put up 200 million in cash and make 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake .
UAL management was to pay 15 million for 10 % and British Air was to receive a 15 % stake .
The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing .
Since then UAL stock has fallen 33 % in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever .
The tenor of Mr. Stevens 's remarks seemed to indicate that British Air will take a more active high-profile role in pursuing any new bid .
He said he believes UAL management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction .
Mr. Stevens said British Air has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group led by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and has n't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming .
As far as we 're concerned we 're waiting for the dust to settle he said .
Although British Air is waiting to see what the buy-out group comes up with Mr. Stevens said a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks .
He said the original proposal is dead and all aspects of a revised version are up for change in light of the changes in UAL 's market price the amount of debt banks are willing to fund and the price British Air would be willing to pay .
Mr. Stevens said he expects the new price will be considerably lower but declined to specify a figure .
Asked whether a 230-a-share figure circulating in the market yesterday is too low he said It 's certainly not too low .
He added the original offer was a pretty full price and that British Air 's contribution was quite a large chunk for us .
British Air was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a 15 % stake in the company but was n't particularly happy with paying 750 million .
If the new deal had us putting up less money but still having 15 % that would be a point in our favor he said .
In any new proposal British Air would expect a greater rate of return than the 20%-plus in the original proposal .
In the event that the buy-out group stalls in reviving its bid the UAL board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction even without any legal obligation to do so .
Roughly one-third of its stock is believed held by takeover stock traders who could vote to oust the board if they become impatient .
Meanwhile the buy-out group 's task of holding its fragile coalition together in the face of the bid 's collapse and internal opposition from two other employee groups has been further complicated by an apparent rift in the ranks of the pilot union itself .
A pilot representing a group of 220 pilots hired during United 's 1985 strike filed suit Friday in Chicago federal court to block the takeover .
The dissident pilots oppose the plan because it would cause them to lose their seniority .
UAL 's management agreed to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the United pilot union for the buy-out proposal .
The 220 pilots involved in the suit are n't members of the union .
The airline had allowed them to move ahead of some union members in seniority following the 1985 strike a move the union had contested in a previous lawsuit .

Corporate efforts to control health-care costs by requiring evaluations prior to planned hospitalization and surgery have n't been sweeping enough to reduce the long-term rate of cost increases according to a study by the Institute of Medicine .
In the last decade many corporations have embraced the utilization management cost containment strategy as a way to control health-care costs for employees .
These programs vary widely but often require second opinions on proposed surgery preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods .
Between 50 % and 75 % of today 's workers are covered by such plans up from 5 % five years ago .
Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers utilization management like most other cost containment strategies does n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs the Institute of Medicine an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences concluded after a two-year study .
Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends .
While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs according to the report by a panel of health-care experts .
The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow .
The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital and not the actual need for a particular procedure has been the main focus the panel said .
As a general rule prior-review programs have not made case-by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care .
The report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines .
Howard Bailit a panel member and a vice president of Aetna Life & Casualty said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals .
There 's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization he said .
But at the same time spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed .
It 's like squeezing a balloon Dr. Bailit said .
David Rahill of A. Foster Higgins & Co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about 5 % but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs .
Jerome Grossman chairman of the panel agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high .
You have a whole staff standing ready to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment he said .
Dr. Grossman who also is president of New England Medical Center Hospitals in Boston noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than 100 utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements .
The panel urged greater efforts to reduce the complexity paperwork and cost of utilization review .
Utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and providers the panel concluded .
Renault and DAF Trucks NV announced a preliminary agreement to jointly manufacture a line of trucks in Britain and France .
Philippe Gras a Renault managing director said the new line will cover trucks of between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons and will be built at Renault 's Bapilly plant in France and at DAF 's British plant .
The French state-controlled auto group and the Dutch truck maker plan to incorporate the new trucks into their product lines when they begin production toward the middle of the 1990s .
Mr. Gras said he expects a definitive agreement between the two companies to be completed in the next few months .
The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in Europe ahead of the 1992 deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the European Community .
Renault and DAF are expected to invest a total of about three billion French francs 157.8 million in the venture including FFr 1 billion for design and development costs .
In addition the companies will each spend about FFr 1 billion on tooling up their plants .
Mr. Gras said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles .
By pooling their resources the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed he said .
Renault officials said the potential European market for light trucks in the 2.5-ton to 4.2-ton range is between 700,000 and 800,000 vehicles annually and Renault and DAF are aiming for a combined market share of about 11 % .
Both Renault and DAF will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks .
Under a separate arrangement British Aerospace PLC 's Rover Group PLC subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the U.K. and Renault 's truck-building subsidiary Renault Vehicles Industriels will have similar rights in France .
DAF is 16%-owned by British Aerospace with a further 6.5 % held by the Dutch state-owned chemical group NV DSM .
The van Doorne family of the Netherlands holds an additional 11 % of DAF 's capital .
The Federal Reserve System is the standard object of suggestions for organizational and institutional changes for two reasons .
First its position in the government is anomalous .
It has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government 's instruments the control of the money supply .
Thus we have a condition that is easily described as undemocratic .
Second the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as guardian of the currency which means as guardian of the stability of the price level sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular .
As former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin used to say they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting .
So the Federal Reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians .
The Fed is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness like high interest rates or slow economic growth while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the Fed 's independence .
This leads to proposals for reform of the Fed which have the common feature of making the Fed more responsive to the administration to the Congress and to public opinion without however any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians .
These proposals include changing the term of the chairman shortening the terms of the members eliminating the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks from the decision-making process putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Federal Reserve Board having the Fed audited by an arm of Congress the General Accounting Office putting the Fed 's expenditures in the budget and requiring prompt publication of the Fed 's minutes .
Some of these ideas are again under consideration in Congress .
But these proposals do not rest on a view of what the Fed 's problem is or if they do they rest on an incorrect view .
They would not solve the problem they would make it worse .
The problem is not that the Fed is too unresponsive to the public interest .
On the contrary it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest .
The price level in the U.S. is now about 4 1\/4 times as high as it was 30 years ago .
On average something that cost 100 30 years ago now costs 425 .
Or a wage that was 100 30 years ago would buy only 23.53 worth of stuff today .
On two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than 10 % a year .
In each case the ending of this unsustainable inflation caused a severe recession the two worst of the postwar period .
The enormous inflation over the past 30 years was largely due to monetary policy .
At least it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period .
And that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the Federal Reserve .
The basic problem of monetary policy to which reform of the Fed should be addressed is to prevent a recurrence of this experience .
There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years 1 .
To some extent the Federal Reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output .
2 .
Even where the Fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it .
Despite all the formal provisions for its independence the Fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it .
The common proposals for reforming the Fed would only make the situation worse if they had any effect at all .
Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors one of the leading proposals today is an example .
The secretary is the world 's biggest borrower of money .
He has a built-in constant longing for lower interest rates .
Moreover he is a political agent of a political president who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election and less to its longer-run health .
These days the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be which is a diversion from the real business of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the price level .
How should a reasonable member of the Federal Reserve Board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board .
Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the Fed to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level .
Or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents low interest rates short-run economic expansion and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels .
The answer seems perfectly clear .
True a succession of Fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the Secretary of the Treasury belongs on the Fed .
By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew in which case it is natural that the Fed and the Treasury and probably also the Congress should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot .
The Fed 's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the government .
The Fed 's problem is not that it is too independent or too unpolitical .
The Fed is responsive to and can not help being responsive to the more overtly political part of the government .
The Fed exercises a power given to it by Congress and the president .
But Congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the Fed .
Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic .
What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level .
To leave this decision to an independent agency is not only undemocratic .
It also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale because it leaves the Fed guessing about what are the expectations of its masters the politicians who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy .
The greatest contribution Congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System .
Legislation to this effect has been introduced in Congress in this session by Rep. Stephen Neal D. N.C .
.
It is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted however .
Congress would be required to make a hard decision and Congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact .
People will say that the nation and the government have other objectives in addition to stabilizing the price level which is true .
But that is not the same as saying that the Federal Reserve has other objectives .
The government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives .
But it has only the Fed to pursue price-level stability .
And the Fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level .
The two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the Fed are high employment and rapid real growth .
But the main lesson of economic policy in the past 30 years is that if the Fed compromises with the price-stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation .

Republic New York Corp. joined the list of banks boosting reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries setting out a 200 million provision and posting a 155.4 million third-quarter net loss as a result .
The per-share loss was 5.32 .
In the year earlier period the New York parent of Republic National Bank had net income of 38.7 million or 1.12 a share .
Excluding the provision Republic earned 44.6 million up 15 % from a year ago .
The bank 's medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries total 293 million of which 146 million are n't accruing interest the bank said .
Republic 's total of nonperforming assets was 167 million at Sept. 30 with its reserve for loan losses now standing at 357 million .
Abortion-rights advocates won last week 's battles but the war over the nation 's most-contentious social question is about to pick up again on turf that favors those seeking to restrict abortions .
Strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state House in Pennsylvania next week with easy approval by the Senate and by Democratic Gov. Bob Casey expected shortly thereafter .
Legislation to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of 18 can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the Michigan legislature and set up a grinding battle to override the expected veto of Democratic Gov. James Blanchard .
The short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the debate in the next several months the reawakening of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude and the ability of each side to counter the other 's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere .
The action in Pennsylvania for example will follow last week 's collapse of a special session of the Florida legislature to enact restrictions on abortions in that state and the vote here in Washington by the House to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest .
But President Bush is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that along with the easy approval of the Pennsylvania measure is likely to mute the abortion-rights activists ' claims of momentum and underline the challenges faced by this resurgent movement .
It 's great to feel good for once in 15 years says Harrison Hickman a consultant to abortion-rights advocates reflecting the relief of his compatriots after last week 's victories the first major events since the Supreme Court in its July 3 Webster decision permitted the states to enact restrictions on abortions .
But how many more times we 're going to feel good in the next 15 is another question .
Indeed abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests .
The pro-choice movement has shown finally that it can mobilize says Glen Halva-Neubauer a Furman University political scientist who specializes in how state legislators handle the abortion question .
But it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time .
The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the viewpoints of the state 's citizens .
As a result GOP state Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County the legislature 's leading foe of abortion has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and he hopes to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place .
The Freind legislation the state 's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy except to avert the death of the mother .
Mr. Freind calculates that the provision which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established will make it necessary for the Supreme Court to review Roe and perhaps to overturn it .
But the Pennsylvania measure also includes an informed consent provision that may become widely imitated by abortion foes who want to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves .
Under this legislation a woman must be informed 24 hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks .
Regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion Mr. Freind argues it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which one way or the other might remain with her for the rest of her life .
In Michigan where the state Senate is expected to approve parental-consent legislation by the end of next week Gov. Blanchard is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists .
Susan Rogin a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state takes comfort from the fact that the state 's House abortion opponents have n't been able to muster the votes to overturn a veto on abortion in 16 years .
But proponents believe they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents ' rights .
In Illinois lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on fetuses at 20 weeks to determine their gestational age weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that if fetuses survive an abortion a second doctor must be on hand to help it survive .
The legislation failed by one vote to clear the House Rules Committee Tuesday but anti-abortionists still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this fall .
Pamela Sutherland executive director of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council says she and her allies are cautiously optimistic they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote .
Abortion foes in Wisconsin meanwhile expect a parental-consent bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early November and are hopeful of prevailing in both houses by next March .
In Texas abortion opponents want to pass parental-consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds personnel and facilities for abortion and viability tests for fetuses 19 weeks and older .
The anti-abortionists are urging GOP Gov. Bill Clements to press the issues in a special session scheduled to run Nov. 14 to Dec. 13 .
The prognosis is only fair says Kathie Roberts administrative director of the Texas Right to Life Committee .
Next year is an election year and the legislators just do n't want to do anything about this now .
This legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new mobilization efforts plunging into gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey and girding for next autumn 's state elections .
At the same time abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy deciding to move on what Jacki Ragan the National Right to Life Committee 's director of state organizational development calls reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of Americans support .
These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection and the public funding of alternatives for abortion .
Those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves pro-choice rather than pro-abortion says Mary Spaulding the group 's associate state legislative coordinator .
Over the weekend the National Abortion Rights Action League singled out eight politicians including Pennsylvania 's Mr. Freind as 1990 targets and held a Washington seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures .
We now see pro-choice legislators going on the offensive for the first time says Kate Michelman executive director of the group .

Congress sent President Bush an 18.4 billion fiscal 1990 Treasury and Postal Service bill providing 5.5 billion for the Internal Revenue Service and increasing the Customs Service 's air-interdiction program nearly a third .
Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the Senate and the swift passage contrasted with months of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special-interest provisions for both members and the executive branch .
An estimated 33 million was added for university and science grants including 1.5 million for Smith College .
And Southwest lawmakers were a driving force behind 54.6 million for U.S.-Mexico border facilities or more than double the administration 's request .
More than 1.8 million is allocated for pensions and expenses for former presidents and the budget for the official residence of Vice President Quayle is more than doubled with 200,000 designated for improvements to the property .
Even the Office of Management and Budget is remembered with an extra 1 million to help offset pay costs that other government departments are being asked to absorb .
Within the IRS nearly 1.95 billion is provided for processing tax returns a 12 % increase over fiscal 1989 and double what the government was spending five years ago .
Investigation and taxpayer service accounts would grow to 1.6 billion and Congress specifically added 7.4 million for stepped up criminal investigations of money laundering related to drug traffic .
The large increase in Customs Service air-interdiction funds is also intended to counter smuggling and the annual appropriations level has more than quadrupled in five years .
The 196.7 million provided for fiscal 1990 anticipates the purchase of a Lockheed P-3 surveillance aircraft and five Cessna Citation II jets .
Despite administration reservations the plan has had the quiet backing of customs officials as well as influential lawmakers from Cessna 's home state Kansas .

In a separate development a private meeting is scheduled this morning between House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten D. Miss .
and Sen. Dale Bumpers D. Ark .
in an effort to end a dispute which for two weeks has delayed action on an estimated 44 billion agriculture bill .
A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides .
The program 's nonprofit sponsors received 900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990 .
The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use but as a master of pork-barrel politics he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a Tennessee center near Memphis and the northern Mississippi border .

B.A.T Industries PLC may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan including the sale of its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field units in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets company officials said .
The British conglomerate planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a 13.35 billion 21.03 billion takeover bid by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value-boosting measures .
If anything the gyrations in world stock markets and in B.A.T 's share price since last Friday 's sharp Wall Street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring analysts and several big institutional holders said .
Thank God we have some deal on the table said Stewart Gilchrist a director at Scottish Amicable Investment Managers which intends to vote its roughly 1 % stake in favor of the restructuring .
Investors in B.A.T have been on a roller coaster .
B.A.T has been London 's best-performing blue chip over the past six months up 40 % against a 4 % rise in the Financial Times 100-Share Index .
But this week B.A.T has been hit harder than other big U.K. stocks first by the market gyrations then by Tuesday 's San Francisco earthquake which could leave B.A.T 's Farmers Group Inc. insurance unit facing big claims .
B.A.T rose five pence eight cents to 756 pence 11.91 in London yesterday as a late market rally erased a 28-pence fall earlier in the day .
To fight off predators B.A.T plans to spin off about 6 billion in assets largely by selling such U.S. retailing units as Marshall Field and Saks and by floating its big paper and U.K. retailing business via share issues to existing holders .
Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10 % of its shares and a 50 % dividend increase .
I think the restructuring will get the required support said Michael Pacitti an analyst at London stockbroker UBS Phillips & Drew .
The shareholders effectively will support the share price by clearing the share buy-back .
But B.A.T 's restructuring which was never going to happen quickly now will take longer because of the market upheaval .
Company officials holders and analysts who previously expected the disposals to be substantially complete by the end of next year 's first half now say the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second half .
We are n't forced sellers .
We do n't have an absolute deadline and if market conditions are truly awful we might decide it is not the right time to take particular steps said Michael Prideaux a B.A.T spokesman .
Even if B.A.T receives approval for the restructuring the company will remain in play say shareholders and analysts though the situation may unfold over the next 12 months rather than six .
The new B.A.T will be a smaller tobacco and financial-services hybrid whose price-earnings ratio may more closely reflect the lower-growth tobacco business than the higher-multiple financial-services business these holders believe .
Thus B.A.T 's restructuring may only make the company a more manageable target for other corporate predators possibly such acquisitive bidders as Hanson PLC .
The last few days will surely slow down the pace of events says Scottish Amicable 's Mr. Gilchrist .
But I would n't write off Sir James or other potential bidders .
Among possible delays the sales of Saks and Marshall Field which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial Christmas season may slide into the second quarter or second half .
Analysts estimate that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly 2 billion .
B.A.T is n't predicting a postponement because the units are quality businesses and we are encouraged by the breadth of inquiries said Mr. Prideaux .
But the delay could happen if B.A.T does n't get adequate bids he said .
People familiar with B.A.T say possible acquirers for the units include managers from both retailing chains and General Cinema Corp. which is interested in bidding for Saks .
Other potential bidders for parts of B.A.T 's U.S. retail unit include Dillard Department Stores Inc. May Department Stores Co. and Limited Inc .
B.A.T has declined to identify the potential bidders .
Though Sir James has said he intends to mount a new bid for B.A.T once approval from U.S. insurance regulators is received jitters over prospects for junk-bond financing and U.S. leverage buy-outs are making investors more skeptical about Sir James 's prospects .
His initial offer indicated he needed to raise as much as 80 % of the takeover financing through the debt markets .
Market uncertainty also clouds the outlook for B.A.T 's attracting a premium price for its U.S. retailing properties .
Finally Tuesday 's California earthquake initially knocked 3.7 % off B.A.T 's share price in London yesterday because of fears of the potential claims to Los Angeles-based Farmers which has a substantial portion of its property and casualty exposure in California .
On Farmers Mr. Prideaux said it is too early to quantify the level of poten
