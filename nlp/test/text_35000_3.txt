s Lynch Telephone Corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of Western New Mexico Telephone Co. for 20 million plus assumption of 24 million of debt .
Western New Mexico Telephone Silver City had net income of 1.9 million on revenue of about 10 million last year .
It is an independent phone company with a service area of 15,000 square miles in southwest New Mexico .
It is also a partner in the wireline cellular franchise covering most of western New Mexico .
The transaction represents Lynch 's entry into the telephone business .
The company which has interests in television trucking services and glass-making and food-processing equipment said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry .
Nelson Bunker Hunt 's attempted corner on silver a decade ago is still haunting the market in this metal .
Silver now trading around 5 an ounce surged to an all-time peak of 50 an ounce in January 1980 from around 9 in mid-1979 .
Mr. Hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression says Lesley Edgar managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd. London bullion brokers .
While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use Mr. Edgar says .
Photographic developers for example bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs negatives and processing solutions .
Meanwhile the photographic industry which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption continues to look for substitutes .
Japanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require silver dealers say .
Silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors dealers say .
Even in the present uncertain investment climate investors are preferring quality assets such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold silver and platinum dealers say .
Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation dealers say .
Silver however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum .
Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s .
Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals says Frederick R. Demler analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
A further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the U.S. he says .
Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union .
Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico Mr. Demler says .
Meanwhile total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row he says .
Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces .
Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance Mr. Demler says .
Despite intermittent rallies in the past few years improvements in the supply-demand balance have n't managed to push silver prices into a higher range .
There 's just too much silver around says Tom Butler an analyst at Samuel Montagu & Co. a London bullion house .
A huge silver stockpile at exchanges refiners consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report .
This year alone inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces because of producer deliveries de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors says Rhona O'Connell London-based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton .
Silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend Ms. O'Connell says .
Moreover while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price silver does n't have the same mystique dealers say .
Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold says Urs Seiler senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland .
Yet if gold prices improve silver prices could rally sharply he says .
However dealers caution that any increase would be 1 to 2 at most .
Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week Livestock and Meats Analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found fewer-than-expected cattle on feedlots .
After the close of trading Friday the Agriculture Department reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8.06 million cattle on Oct. 1 down 6 % from that date a year earlier .
Most analysts had expected the government to report a 4 % decline .
Feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef .
The government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5 % compared with the year-earlier quarter .
Many industry analysts had been projecting a 3 % decline in placements for the quarter .
In the 1988 quarter many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches .
The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable .
A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy .
The Agriculture Department also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered in the quarter dropped by 5 % from the 1988 quarter which was in line with projections by analysts .
Energy Friday 's 44-cent-a-barrel price drop to 19.98 in the expiring November contract for West Texas Intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board .
Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions .
Barring any petroleum-related news events trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm .
Copper Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon .
For example copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at 1.2345 a pound .
Pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes .
On Friday one analyst said rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia .
In Mexico the analyst added employees at the Cananea mine who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force .
The mine is expected to return to production in about a week .
On Friday selling dominated the afternoon curb session in London which takes place at noon EDT .
The premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed indicating weaker demand for cash copper .
Long-term support for the December contract was believed to be at 1.25 a pound .
A technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it .
That brought in considerable fund selling which continued until the close of trading .
In general it was a bearish close said Ben Hanauer a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co. a major commodities trading and brokerage firm .
But whether this price break has implications for this week he said we will know more when the London Metal Exchange copper stock levels are released Monday morning .
Another analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued .
Bernard Savaiko senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. said that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks they perceived a bearish sign .
He also noted that the Japanese who had been buying at prices just above the 1.25 level apparently pulled back from the market on Friday .
Mr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to 1.05 a pound .
Hewlett-Packard Co. will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other .
Called Task Broker the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together .
If a machine has a big computing task Task Broker asks other computers in the network for bids on the job .
It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine .
Hewlett-Packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast .
The new Hewlett-Packard program said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc. a computer-market research company is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing .
In today 's computer networks some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed .
With the Hewlett-Packard program he said You get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers .
The program which will be shipped in January 1990 runs on the Unix operating system .
Hewlett-Packard will charge 5,000 for a license covering 10 users .
The program now works on all Hewlett-Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford Conn .
Hewlett-Packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines .
The Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network .
A previously available program called Network Computing System developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division for instance takes a task and splits it up into parts divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing .
But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system .
Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker Hewlett-Packard said and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work .
The Task Broker turns that network into as far as the user is concerned one giant computer said Bill Kay general manager of Hewlett-Packard 's workstation group .
Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys the franchisees .
When elephants start fighting ants get killed says Murray Riese co-owner of National Restaurants a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut Roy Rogers and other chains .
As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another franchisers are struggling desperately for market share slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions .
The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees .
The chains used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow but in the last year or so discounting has become a 12-month thing says Donald Harty president of Charisma Group Inc. a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain .
Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year Mr. Harty says profits will be flat or lower .
And Bill Konopnicki a Safford Ariz. licensee of McDonald 's Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory Board says some fast-food outlets could be in serious trouble based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on .
Until recently the huge fast-food industry with sales of about 60.1 billion last year kept price-skirmishing to a minimum .
But early this year PepsiCo Inc. 's Taco Bell unit and Wendy 's International Inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions says John Rohs an analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Co .
That brought a chain reaction in the industry .
The situation was further aggravated early this month when McDonald 's set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons .
It also decided to go national with pizza which it has been test-marketing .
Now two-for-one deals on pizza are common so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high .
The discounting say fast-food operators occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before .
The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even laying off middle managers and working harder to make less .
Joe Mack a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. a Burger King operator in Omaha Neb. says discounting is so prevalent that we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers to keep sales level .
It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food he says .
Alan D'Agosto president of Panda 's Inc. an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha says All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming but we are n't increasing sales .
With fast-food outlets on every corner he like many does n't think he has a choice in the price war Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon .
If the battle continues much longer many fast-food businesses will close or merge predicts Vincent Morrissey who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest .
The industry is overbuilt he says .
Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available .
The National Restaurant Association says quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 the last year for which figures are available .
With the market so crowded says a spokesman for Wendy 's in Columbus Ohio If you 're doing well you 're doing well at someone else 's expense .
Simply put there is n't enough business for every store to grow .
According to Mr. Rohs inflation-adjusted same-store sales at company-owned Wendy 's units in the U.S. have trailed year-earlier levels throughout 1989 except for August .
McDonald 's has also been running negative all year the analyst says .
Spokesmen for Wendy 's and McDonald 's criticized Mr. Rohs 's calculations .
Jack Greenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald 's says the company does n't compute much less disclose inflation-adjusted same-store sales .
He adds that short-term comparisons can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year .
Profit margins at company-owned McDonald 's outlets in the U.S. are holding up quite nicely says Mr. Greenberg .
Profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s he adds .
But Mr. Greenberg 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers .
Smaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail many in the industry predict .
Big franchise groups can ride out the storm a lot longer says Mr. Harty the Burger King operator in New York .
The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees .
Mr. Morrissey the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties or portion of sales that they must pay franchisers .
Franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting .
But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end says Lew Rudnick a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients .
He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing .
In any case many franchisees in order to stay on good terms with franchisers routinely go along with promotions .
Says Mr. Riese of National Restaurants If you resisted on prices maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise .
Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates .
The companies are followed by at least three analysts and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days .
Otherwise actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate .

CalMat Co. said it completed a 32.8 million sale of assets from its Los Angeles area real estate portfolio for net income of 12 million .
CalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt concrete rock and sand .
And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an IRS audit .
Reggie Jackson the retired baseball star has found another use for them .
Mr. Jackson who won the nickname Mr. October for his World Series exploits is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as 500 each .
Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. Jackson 's canceled checks is unusual .
I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it says Jack Smalling a dealer in Ames Iowa and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs .
An initial batch of Mr. Jackson 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend .
Mr. Jackson showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well .
For someone who has everything else Reggie 's jersey cap and cards his checks might be a nice addition says William Vizas owner of Bill 's Sports Collectibles in Denver who examined the checks at the San Francisco card show .
For years the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold .
But these players were dead .
Maybe three years ago there were a lot of Ty Cobbs in the hobby and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks says Mr. Smalling .
However the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way .
Maybe I 'm a little stuffy but I would n't sell them sniffs Bob Machon owner of Papa 's Sports Cards in Menlo Park Calif .
Who knows how much they 'll be worth 100 years from now .
And Mr. Smalling does n't believe they 're worth all that much now .
I do n't think the checks are worth 15 apiece he says .
Why Mr. Jackson who could n't be reached for comment has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear .
He probably has n't done it for the cash .
I would say he 's definitely not in need of money says Matt Merola an agent of Mr. Jackson 's based in New York .
He has good investments .
And Mr. Jackson probably has opened new checking accounts too .
Or at least he should .
I assume those accounts are closed says Mr. Smalling referring to the accounts of the canceled checks .
I do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers .
USX Corp. and its Japanese partner Kobe Steel Ltd. agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products mainly for the automotive market .
Terms were n't disclosed for the plant which will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons .
The move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies .
Bethlehem Steel Corp. LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel .
The surge in production analysts say raises questions about capacity outpacing demand .
They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 when the current import trade restraint program ends which could result in more imports .
There 's too much capacity contended Charles Bradford an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
I do n't think there 's anyone not building one .
He does add however that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos instead of relying heavily on imported steel .
That trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet .
The hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills those spun off to employees .
Indeed USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 .
For the first eight months of 1989 analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % .
USX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 .
USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production .
Moreover it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons .
The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines .
Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel .
One of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly .
ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment the rest is easy right .
You just call your broker and say buy or sell .
Dream on .
There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing .
So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges .
Two things to keep in mind Not all exchanges accept every type of order .
And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer .
Market Order This is probably the most widely used order and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers since it imposes no price restrictions .
With a market order an investor tells a broker to buy or sell at the market .
It 's like saying get me in now or get me out now .
For example if wheat is being offered at 4.065 and bid at 4.060 a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price .
A recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers .
Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers .
Limit Order Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment .
Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it .
Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than 55 .
A limit order to sell could be entered at that price .
One risk Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls .
Unless the market goes at least one tick the smallest price increment permitted beyond the limit price investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price .
Stop Order Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level .
Once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get .
Stop orders are sometimes called stop-loss orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses .
While stop orders sound similar to limit orders there is a difference Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above .
In contrast sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below .
The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do .
An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at 90 under a stock that was trading at 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday .
Stop-Limit Order Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order .
Unlike stop orders which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price .
If it ca n't be made at that price it does n't get filled .
Investors who wish to be out of a position without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled .
But if the market moves quickly enough it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price .
Market-If-Touched Order Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached .
However unlike a buy-stop order a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it .
As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price .
Fill-Or-Kill Order The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades .
It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better .
But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately the order is automatically canceled .
Gregory Bessemer who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options .
I like to use them to feel out the market he says .
If they do n't fill it immediately then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price .
Not-Held Order This is another timing order .
It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment if they think they can get a better price by waiting .
Not-held orders which are also known as disregard the tape orders are always done at the customer 's risk .
One-Cancels-The-Other Order This is really two orders in one generally for the same security or commodity instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order .
In a fast-moving market it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security .
Specific-Time Order This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time .
On the close can be added to many types of orders .
For example market-on-close orders must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange .
Stop-close-only orders are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading .
Day orders expire at the end of the day on which they are entered good-till-canceled orders have no expiration date .
Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise .
On Oct. 19 1987 some investors learned the consequences of entering good-til-canceled limit orders and then forgetting about them .
They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel .
It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed .
Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are usually stuck with the consequences .
Mr. Angrist writes on the options and commodities markets for The Wall Street Journal .
IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments there 's probably no starting place better than beta .
But investors better not ignore its limitations either .
Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund .
For any given move in the overall market it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall .
Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret .
The beta of the broad market typically defined as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index is always 1.0 .
So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile and so on .
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas .
Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market .
Remember though that beta also has important limitations .
Beta is only part of the risk in a stock says William F. Sharpe the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure .
There is risk that is not associated with market moves and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that .
In particular beta does n't measure the company and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock .
That business risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio .
Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer .
In particular the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired .
Concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the American Association of Individual Investors to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual-fund guide .
Our fear was people would look just at the beta of a gold fund and say here is an investment with very low risk says John Markese director of research for the Chicago-based group .
In reality it 's very volatile but the movements are not because of market movements .
READY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio .
First a pop quiz .
When you think of the words risk and investment what 's the specific peril that comes to mind .
Pencils down .
If you 're like most people you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding .
People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension says Timothy Kochis national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte Haskins & Sells .
But therein lies another aspect of investment risk the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others .
This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs .
Risk wears many disguises and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other less obvious kinds .
U.S. Treasury bonds for example are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity .
But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments .
Risk is also a function of time .
When financial professionals measure risk mathematically they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns .
Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills for example because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider .
That is usually measured by the standard deviation or divergence of annual results from the average return over time .
But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals .
For instance some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash last Friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings .
But the stock market despite some stomach-churning declines has far outperformed other securities over extended periods .
By retreating to the apparent security of say money-market funds investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement .
That 's the biggest risk of all the risk of not meeting your objectives says Steven B. Enright a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services .
As a result financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients ' portfolios .
They estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year .
They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals .
And they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified .
The portfolios of two hypothetical families one a couple at retirement age and another a two-income couple at age 45 illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider .
For instance the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk .
But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk .
The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stoc
