Freight rates declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation are bottoming out turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation .
Trucking shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases scheduled for this fall or early next year reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport .
Major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years .
That 's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad .
Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation and rates are starting to move up at a rate close to or slightly more than the inflation rate said Clifford Sayre director of logistics at Du Pont Co .
Shippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University said they expect their freight-transport storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % this year .
Only 10 % of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease compared with 30 % who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years .
This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates said Bernard LaLonde a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus .
The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation .
Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill .
Shippers cut about 35 billion from their annual inter-city truck and rail costs to about 150 billion or about 6.4 % of gross national product down from 8 % of GNP in 1981 .
But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates .
Shippers are saying the party 's over said Mr. LaLonde .
Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years .
Transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy .
Robert Delaney a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc. Cambridge Mass. said We 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions .
Now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor .
You 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously .
Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers .
There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck said Gerard McCullough lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Less-than-truckload companies which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer discounted away a 4.7 % rate increase implemented last April .
The carriers were competing fiercely for market share .
Railroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks .
An official at Consolidated Freightways Inc. a Menlo Park Calif. less-than-truckload carrier said rate discounting in that industry has begun to
