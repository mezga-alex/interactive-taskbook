ial-Bache said the York issue was delayed because of market conditions .
Everything is going through firehoops right now and Chicago & North Western is no exception said Mariel Clemensen vice president high-yield research at Citicorp .
Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals .
Dan Baldwin managing director of high-yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management said the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured in part because several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package .
If you 're going to take the risk in this market you want something extra .
Mr. Baldwin likes the offering .
But several mutual-fund managers nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class .
While they consider the Chicago & North Western issue to be good they do n't view it as the best .
To lure buyers to the Chicago & North Western bonds portfolio managers said Donaldson Lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10 % equity kicker .
The bonds are expected to have a 14 1\/2 % coupon rate .
The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10 % of the stock of CNW Corp. Chicago & North Western 's parent company .
Donaldson Lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring .
According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations the 10 % of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank Blackstone Group which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5 % each .
That would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60 % stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15 % .
Despite the problems with new issues high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary or resell market .
Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership rising one point .
In the Treasury market the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point or 8.75 for each 1,000 face amount .
The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows .
That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower .
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2 % last month slightly lower than some economists had expected .
But there were also rumors yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term Treasurys .
Short-term Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher .
Yesterday the Fed executed four-day matched sales a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system .
The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the Fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 3\/4 % at which it has been hovering around during the past week .
The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans .
It is considered an early signal of Fed credit policy changes .
The fact that they did four-day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively .
They are telling us that 8 3\/4 % is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate said Robert Chandross at Lloyds Bank PLC .
Treasury Securities The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 25\/32 to yield 7.955 % compared with 100 29\/32 to yield 8.032 % Wednesday .
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 9\/32 to yield 7.937 % compared with 99 26\/32 to yield 8.007 % .
Short-term rates rose yesterday .
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % .
Meanwhile the Treasury sold 9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday .
The average yield on the bills was 7.35 % down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21 .
Yesterday 's yield was the lowest since 7.22 % on July 27 .
Here are details of the auction Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it .
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year .
Corporate Issues Junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities .
Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1\/4 to 1\/2 point with so-called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one-point gains .
Petrolane Gas Service 's 13 1\/4 % debentures traded at 102 after trading around par earlier this week and RJR 's 13 1\/2 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5\/8 after trading at below par earlier this week .
Investment-grade bonds were unchanged .
Municipals Activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector .
Traders estimated that more than 140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers .
There was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios .
According to market participants the bonds were met with decent bids but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield .
Away from the general obligation sector activity was modest .
Long dollar bonds were flat to up 3\/8 point .
New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was up 3\/8 at 98 3\/8 bid to yield about 7.32 % down 0.03 percentage point .
The debt of some California issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday 's massive earthquake although traders said market participants remained cautious .
California expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its 1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated 500 million to 1 billion in damages resulting from the quake according to a state official .
It 's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve said Cindy Katz assistant director of California 's department of finance although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated .
Meanwhile new issuance was slow .
The largest sale in the competitive arena was a 55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority .
A balance of 25.8 million remained in late order-taking according to the lead manager .
Mortgage-Backed Securities Mortgage securities generally ended 6\/32 to 9\/32 point higher but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts .
Premium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon rates of 13 % and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by Congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages .
Ginnie Mae 13 % securities were down about 1\/4 at 109 30\/32 .
If the refinancing plan clears Congress there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities hurting any investor paying much above par for them .
In the current-coupon sector a shift in the Treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings .
Ginnie Mae 9 % securities ended at 98 6\/32 up 9\/32 and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 % securities were at 97 10\/32 up 6\/32 .
The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 9.42 % to a 12-year average life assumption as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48 .
While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the Treasury yield curve underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable .
Two new Remics totaling 900 million were announced by Freddie Mac yesterday .
Foreign Bonds British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson .
The Treasury 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 was down 2\/32 at 111 29\/32 to yield 10.09 % while the 11 3\/4 % notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 19\/32 to yield 12.94 % .
In Japan the bellwether No. 111 4.6 % bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72 to yield 5.32 % and in West Germany the 7 % benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02 % .
THE PANHANDLER approaches makes his pitch .
It may be straightforward he wants money for food or incredibly convoluted his sister is at this very moment near death in Hoboken he has lost his wallet and has only 1.22 in change to put toward a bus ticket costing 3.83 and wo n't you give him the difference .
No .
Well how about a loan he 'll take your name and address Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this .
But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer famine child abuse or what have you .
Most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals .
But will it .
In a distressing number of cases no .
In fact the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler at least he has no overhead and he might even be telling the truth .
Last year more than 100 billion was donated to the nation 's 400,000 charities .
While the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for it 's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in expenses claimed by other operators including fraudulent expenses .
In many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries .
It 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs high-living operators and downright fraud .
But the problem clearly is widespread and persistent .
State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging .
The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year measuring them against minimum standards for accountability for accuracy and honesty in solicitation and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established .
The Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program .
Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test .
Which it should be added does n't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway .
Without a microscope and a subpoena it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself .
On this basis there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one says David Ormstedt an assistant attorney general in Connecticut .
A lot of donors just get taken .
Including those he contends who put about 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center .
The state has sued these charities in state court complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent 82 % says Mr. Ormstedt went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives for fur coats trips to Florida Lucullan restaurant tabs .
The telephone number for the charity in Shelton Conn. has been disconnected and the former officials could n't be located .
Running a charity does cost money but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed .
The Arthritis Foundation the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90 % of their income on programs not overhead .
With some other charities however it s the other way around .
The fledgling National Children 's Cancer Society for example took in 2.5 million last year to finance bone-marrow transplants for children .
By the time it paid its expenses it only had 120,000 left not enough to treat even one child .
The state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago along with Telesystems Marketing Inc. its Houston-based fund raiser .
Both deny wrongdoing .
The charity admits spending a lot on fund raising but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come .
Michael Burns president of Telesystems says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children 's .
Meanwhile a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds .
Enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising .
State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income usually half that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court .
It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression .
This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently .
The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere .
In making cases the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers .
Illinois for instance currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there .
Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give .
Attorneys general in several states including Illinois are already suing Watson & Hughey Co. an Alexandria Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America .
According to the Illinois attorney general 's suit Watson & Hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes and could win up to an additional 1,000 on top of them if they contributed as little as 7 .
But the total value of the prizes was only 5,000 and most winners will receive just 10 cents according to the attorney general 's office .
The suit is still pending in Illinois state court .
Watson & Hughey has denied the allegations in court officials decline to comment further .
While they can target some of the most obvious miscreants enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface .
There are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious operators they say that it is probably impossible to stop them all .
One maneuver the public education gambit .
The solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue .
What it does n't say is that the entire campaign may be the fund-raising letter itself .
All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as Do n't smoke .
or Wear suntan lotion ' says William Webster attorney general of Missouri .
By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters .
Mr. Webster cites a four-page mailing from the United Cancer Council that offers a chance to win 5,000 in gold bullion to those giving as little as 5 to cancer education .
A few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages .
I think some people may believe they 're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters he says .
Officials at the Washington D.C.-based charity did n't return repeated phone calls .
Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs .
The established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it .
We ca n't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name .
Most of them do n't last for long but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they are n't connected with us says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association .
And sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it .
A couple in Rockford Ill. raised 12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving without permission from the group .
MADD did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for 613 along with a letter saying that was the charity 's share .
The Illinois Attorney General won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without MADD 's permission .
The couple could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left Rockford law enforcement officials report .
Denise McDonald a spokeswoman for MADD says It 's scary because anybody could do this .
Mr. Johnson is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Chicago bureau .
Overhead costs at some of the largest charities in millions of dollars British Airways PLC a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp. washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of United Airlines .
Specifically the British carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for UAL .
In addition British Air officially withdrew its support for the previous 300-a-share bid in a terse statement that said the original deal is closed .
Company officials said later that British Airways believes its involvement in the UAL buy-out ended last Friday when the buy-out group which also includes UAL 's management and pilot union failed to obtain financing for the 6.79 billion transaction .
The carrier stopped short of saying it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for UAL .
However company officials said they plan to take no initiatives to resurrect the transaction and are n't aware of any restructured bid in the making .
Collectively the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for UAL will ever get off the ground .
The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last Friday with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place .
However in response to the British Air decision United 's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out .
Pilot union Chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky said advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL 's board at the earliest time possible .
Pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without British Air 's participation .
UAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement .
