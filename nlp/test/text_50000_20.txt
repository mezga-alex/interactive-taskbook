he industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear .
Indeed the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways .
For example insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy .
Such increased demand for reinsurance along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise .
Reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves .
We are saying this is the breaking point this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace said William Yankus an analyst with Conning & Co. a Hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry .
His firm along with some others issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday .
Among the insurance stocks big gainers included American International Group up 3.25 to 102.625 General Re Corp. up 2.75 to 86.50 Aetna up 2.375 to 59.50 and Marsh & McLennan Inc. up 3.125 to 75.875 .
Still a few individual companies most likely smaller ones could be devastated .
I think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult .
He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo .
British West German Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster .
Although it 's unclear how much exposure the London market will face U.K. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to U.S. catastrophe coverage .
Jack Byrne chairman of Fireman 's Fund said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market causing these rates to soar .
The catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 when another earthquake sparked the Great San Francisco Fire .
Orin Kramer an insurance consultant in New York estimates that the 1906 San Francisco destruction on an inflation-adjusted basis included insured losses of 5.8 billion .
He is estimating this week 's disaster will generate insured losses of 2 billion to 4 billion following about 4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo .
Silicon Graphics Inc. 's first-quarter profit rose sharply to 5.2 million or 28 cents a share from 1 million or six cents a share a year ago .
The maker of computer workstations said a surge of government orders contributed to the increase .
Revenue rose 95 % to 86.4 million from 44.3 million the year earlier .
In national over-the-counter trading the company closed yesterday at 23.25 a share down 25 cents .
Hunter Environmental Services Inc. said it reached a preliminary accord on the sale of its environmental consulting and services business for about 40 million and assumption of related debt .
The buyer was n't identified .
The company said it also is making progress in negotiating the buy-out of its design division by management .
In addition Hunter said it will use proceeds from a private placement of 8 million of preferred shares to purchase an interest in a start-up company to underwrite environmental impairment insurance .
Hunter wants to concentrate its resources on the insurance business and on a project to store hazardous wastes in salt domes .
Jaguar PLC 's chairman said he hopes to reach a friendly pact with General Motors Corp. within a month that may involve the British luxury-car maker 's producing a cheaper executive model .
Sir John Egan told reporters at London 's Motorfair yesterday he would be disappointed if we could n't do the deal within a month .
He said the tie-up would mean Jaguar could develop cars down range in price from where we are by offering access to GM 's high-volume parts production .
Besides creating joint manufacturing ventures the accord is expected to give GM about a 15 % stake that eventually would rise to about 30 % .
Jaguar figures a friendly alliance with GM will fend off unwelcome advances from Ford Motor Co .
But Ford Jaguar 's biggest shareholder since lifting its stake to 10.4 % this week is pressing harder for talks with Sir John .
We 're getting to the point where we are going to have to meet with him one Ford official said yesterday .
Ford probably will renew its request for such a meeting soon he added .
Sir John has spurned Ford 's advances since the U.S. auto giant launched a surprise bid for as much as 15 % of Jaguar last month .
Ford has signaled it might acquire a majority interest later .
I 'm not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody the Jaguar chairman asserted yesterday .
He did n't rule out negotiations with Ford however .
The fiercely proud but financially strapped British company prefers to remain independent and publicly held despite Ford 's promise of access to cash and technological know-how .
Sir John noted that GM a longtime Jaguar supplier agrees we should remain an independent company .
He said Jaguar started negotiating with GM and several other car makers over a year ago but the rest dropped by the wayside ever since the share price went above 4 6.30 a share .
Jaguar shares stood at 405 pence before Ford 's initial announcement but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up .
The stock traded late yesterday on London 's stock exchange at 673 pence up 19 pence .
Developing an executive-model range would mark a major departure for Britain 's leading luxury-car maker .
A typical British executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car .
It generally fetches no more than 25,000 39,400 roughly 16,000 less than the highest-priced Jaguars which are all known for their hand-crafted leather work .
We have designs for such executive cars but have never been able to develop them Sir John said .
GM 's help would make it possible for Jaguar to build a wider range of cars .
An executive model would significantly boost Jaguar 's yearly output of 50,000 cars .
You are talking about a couple hundred thousand a year said Bob Barber an auto-industry analyst at U.K. brokerage James Capel & Co .
A pact with GM may emerge in as little as two weeks according to sources close to the talks .
The deal would require approval by a majority of Jaguar shareholders .
We have to make it attractive enough that holders would accept it Sir John said .
That may be difficult the Jaguar chairman acknowledged when you have somebody else breathing down your neck .
Ford probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from U.S. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later said Stephen Reitman European auto analyst at London brokers UBS Phillips & Drew .
Ford ca n't make a full-fledged bid for Jaguar until U.K. government restrictions expire .
The anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15 % of Jaguar shares without permission until Dec. 31 1990 .
But with its 10.4 % stake Ford can convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely .
It 's a very valuable weapon in their armory which could enable Ford to bid sooner for Jaguar observed Mr. Barber of James Capel .
Otherwise Jaguar may have to tolerate the two U.S. auto giants each owning a 15 % stake for more than a year .
It would be difficult to see how a car company can be owned by a collective Sir John said .
It has never been done before but there 's always a first .
Although two Baby Bells showed strong growth in access lines usage and unregulated business revenue one reported a modest gain in third-quarter net while the other posted a small drop .
Ameritech Corp. 's earnings increased 2.8 % after strong revenue gains were offset somewhat by refunds and rate reductions imposed by regulators in its Midwest territory .
BellSouth Corp. 's third-quarter earnings dropped 3.8 % as a result of debt refinancing the recent acquisition of a cellular and paging property and rate reductions in its Southeast territory .
BellSouth At BellSouth based in Atlanta customer access lines grew by 162,000 or 3.5 % during the 12-month period ended Sept .
For the third quarter total operating revenue grew 2.6 % to 3.55 billion from 3.46 billion .
Total operating expenses increased 3.5 % to 2.78 billion from 2.69 billion .
Overall access minutes of use increased 10.3 % and toll messages jumped 5.2 % .
BellSouth Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John L. Clendenin said three factors accounted for the drop in third-quarter earnings .
The refinancing of 481 million in long-term debt reduced net income by 22 million or five cents a share but in the long run will save more than 250 million in interest costs .
The company previously said that the recent acquisition of Mobile Communications Corp. of America would dilute 1989 earnings by about 3 % .
In addition earnings were reduced by rate reductions in Florida Kentucky Alabama Tennessee and Louisiana .
Ameritech At Ameritech based in Chicago customer access lines increased by 402,000 or 2.6 % and cellular mobile lines increased by 80,000 or 62.3 % for the 12-month period ended Sept. 30 .
For the third quarter revenue increased 1.9 % to 2.55 billion from 2.51 billion .
Operating expenses increased 2.6 % to 2.04 billion including one-time pretax charges of 40 million for labor contract signing bonuses .
Local service revenue increased 3.5 % and directory and unregulated business revenue jumped 9.5 % .
But network access revenue dropped 4 % and toll revenue dropped 1.4 % .

The Wall Street Journal American Way of Buying Survey consists of two separate door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization .
The two surveys which asked different questions were conducted using national random probability samples .
The poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30 1989 .
The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 1989 .
Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data .
For each poll the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the U.S. using the same questionnaire the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1\/2 percentage points in either direction .
The margin of error for subgroups for example married women with children at home would be larger .
In addition in any survey there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings .
Program traders were buying and selling at full steam Monday the first trading session after the stock market 's 190.58-point plunge Friday .
They accounted for a hefty 16 % of New York Stock Exchange volume Monday the fourth busiest session ever .
On Friday 13 % of volume was in computer-guided program trades .
In August by contrast program trading averaged 10.3 % of daily Big Board turnover .
Program traders were publicly castigated following the 508-point crash Oct. 19 1987 and a number of brokerage firms pulled back from using this strategy for a while .
But as the outcry faded by the spring of 1988 they resumed .
Some observers thought that after Friday 's sharp drop the firms would rein in their program traders to avoid stoking more controversy .
But the statistics released yesterday show the firms did nothing of the sort .
One reason they said was that the official reports on the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a cause .
Stock-index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it accelerates market moves if not actually causing them .
In it traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies .
Under the exchange 's definitions program trading also describes a number of other strategies that in the opinion of some traders do n't cause big swings in the market .
The Big Board 's disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual .
Though it collects such data daily its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends .
The September figures are due to be released this week .
The Big Board declined to name the Wall Street firms involved in the activity Friday and Monday or the type of strategies used .
But traders on the exchange floor who can observe the computer-guided trading activity on monitor screens said most of the top program-trading firms were active both days .
Through August the top five program trading firms in volume were Morgan Stanley & Co. Kidder Peabody & Co. Merrill Lynch & Co. PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc .
Though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record .
Besides reciting the pardon for program trading contained in the Brady Commission report they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed Monday to restore the markets ' equilibrium .
On Friday the stock-index futures market was unhinged from the stock market when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange halted trading in Standard & Poor 's 500 futures contract a circuit breaker procedure instituted after the 1987 crash and implemented for the first time .
Futures trading resumed a half-hour later but the session ended shortly thereafter leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs traders said .
By Monday morning they said stock-index arbitrage sell programs helped re-establish the link between stocks and futures .
But stunning volatility was produced in the process .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged a breathtaking 63.52 points in the first 40 minutes of trading Monday as stock-index arbitrage sell programs kicked in .
At about 10:10 a.m. EDT the market abruptly turned upward on stock-index arbitrage buy programs .
By day 's end the Dow industrials had rebounded 88.12 points or nearly half of Friday 's drop .
FREDERICK 'S OF HOLLYWOOD Inc. Los Angeles said its board voted a 50 % increase in the specialty boutique-store operator 's semiannual dividend to five cents a common share .
The dividend is payable Dec. 15 to stock of record Nov. 15 .
Valley National Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of 72.2 million or 3.65 a share and suspended its quarterly dividend because of potential losses on its Arizona real estate holdings .
The Phoenix-based holding company for Arizona 's largest bank said it added 121 million to its allowance for losses on loans and for real estate owned .
The company earned 18.7 million or 95 cents a share a year earlier .
For the nine months Valley National posted a net loss of 136.4 million or 6.90 a share .
It had profit of 48.6 million or 2.46 a share in the 1988 period .
Valley National had been paying a quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share .
The Arizona real estate market continues to be depressed and there is still uncertainty as to when values will recover James P. Simmons chairman said .
The decision to increase the loan-loss reserve and suspend the dividend is both prudent and in the best long-term interest of the shareholders he said .
Valley National said it made the decision on the basis of an overall assessment of the marketplace and the condition of its loan portfolio and after reviewing it with federal regulators .
The addition to reserves comes on top of a provision of 199.7 million that was announced in June .
In July Moody 's downgraded 400 million of the company 's debt saying the bank holding company had n't taken adequate write-offs against potential losses on real estate loans despite its second-quarter write-down .
Richard M. Greenwood Valley National 's executive vice president said then that the company believed the write-downs were adequate and did n't plan to increase its reserves again .
Bruce Hoyt a banking analyst with Boettcher & Co. a Denver brokerage firm said Valley National is n't out of the woods yet .
The key will be whether Arizona real estate turns around or at least stabilizes he said .
They 've stepped up to the plate to take the write-downs but when markets head down a company is always exposed to further negative surprises Mr. Hoyt said .
Valley National closed yesterday at 24.25 a share down 1 in national over-the-counter trading .
Two years of coddling down the drain .
That 's the way a lot of brokers feel today on the second anniversary of the 1987 stock-market crash .
Ever since that fearful Black Monday they 've been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors trying to convince them that Oct. 19 1987 was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place for average Americans to put their hard-earned dollars .
And until last Friday it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off .
Some of those folks were coming back says Leslie Quick Jr. chairman of discount brokers Quick & Reilly Group Inc .
We had heard from people who had n't been active for a long time .
Then came the frightening 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a new wave of stock-market volatility .
All of a sudden it was back to square one .
It 's going to set things back for a period because it reinforces the concern of volatility says Jeffrey B. Lane president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
I think it will shake confidence one more time and a lot of this business is based on client confidence .
Brokers around the country say the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost eerie .
Customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post-crash 1987 .
The kinds of questions you had before have resurfaced says Raymond A. Chip Mason chairman of regional brokerage firm Legg Mason Inc. Baltimore .
I can just tell the questions are right back where they were What 's going on .
Ca n't anything be done about program trading .
Does n't the exchange understand .
Where is the SEC on this .
Mr. Mason says he 's convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks even though they believe the deck is stacked against them .
But these wide swings scare them to death .
All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynch & Co. that have big retail or individual-investor businesses .
After expanding rapidly during the bull-market years up to the 1987 crash retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead .
True the amount of money investors are willing to entrust to their brokers has been growing lately .
But those dollars have been going into such safe products as money market funds which do n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms .
At discount brokerage Charles Schwab & Co. such cash-equivalent investments recently accounted for a record 8 billion of the firm 's 25 billion of client 's assets .
The brokers ' hope has been that they could soon coax investors into shifting some of their hoard into the stock market .
And before last Friday they were actually making modest progress .
A slightly higher percentage of New York Stock Exchange volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash 1988 according to Securities Industry Association data .
In 1987 an average 19.7 % of Big Board volume was retail business with the monthly level never more than 21.4 % .
The retail participation dropped to an average 18.2 % in 1988 and shriveled to barely 14 % some months during the year .
Yet in 1989 retail participation has been more than 20 % in every month and was 23.5 % in August the latest month for which figures are available .
Jeffrey Schaefer the SIA 's research director says that all of his group 's retail-volume statistics could be overstated by as much as five percentage points because corporate buy-backs are sometimes inadvertently included in Big Board data .
But there did seem to be a retail activity pickup .
But Friday did n't help things says Mr. Schaefer .
With the gyrations of recent days says Hugo Quackenbush senior vice president at Charles Schwab many small investors are absolutely convinced that they should n't play in the stock market .
Joseph Grano president of retail sales and marketing at PaineWebber Group Inc. still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market .
Investors will develop thicker skins and their confidence will return he says .
Friday 's plunge he is telling PaineWebber brokers was nothing more than a tremendous reaction to leveraged buy-out stocks .
Meanwhile PaineWebber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving Wall Street their money .
It 's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets rather than push the investor to move into specific products such as equities Mr. Grano says .
The equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there 's a semblance of confidence .
It could be a long wait say some industry observers .
Some investors will tiptoe back in says Richard Ross a market research director for Elrick & Lavidge in Chicago .
Then there 'll be another swing .
Given enough of these this will drive everyone out except the most hardy he adds .
Mr. Ross who has been studying retail investors ' perception of risks in the brokerage industry said a market plunge like Friday 's shatters investors confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market .
The long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is miserable Mr. Ross declares .

John V. Holmes an investment-newsletter publisher and three venture-capital firms he organized were enjoined from violating the registration provisions of the securities laws governing investment companies .
As part of an agreement that settled charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission a receiver was also appointed for the three venture-capital firms .
Mr. Holmes was the subject of a page one profile in The Wall Street Journal in 1984 after the SEC questioned him about ties between him and companies he touted in a newsletter .
In 1986 in another consent agreement with the SEC Mr. Holmes was enjoined from violating the stock-registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws .
Without any admission or denial of guilt by Mr. Holmes that agreement settled SEC charges that Mr. Holmes sold unregistered securities and misled investors .
In charges filed last week in federal district court in Charlotte N.C. the SEC alleged that Venture Capitalists Inc. Venture Finance Corp. and New Ventures Fund Inc. all of Charlotte failed repeatedly to file proper documents .
The SEC also charged that Mr. Holmes acted as an officer or director of New Ventures in violation of his previous consent agreement .
Some companies were delinquent in filings and other actions all of which cost money Mr. Holmes said .
Two of Mr. Holmes 's business associates who worked for Venture Capitalists Kimberly Ann Smith and Frederick Byrum also consented to being enjoined from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws .
Ms. Smith also agreed to a permanent injunction barring her from acting as an officer director or investment adviser of any mutual fund unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company .
Mr. Byrum and Ms. Smith could n't be reached for comment .
In consenting to the injunctions none of the individuals or companies admitted or denied the allegations .
Senate Republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for individuals and corporations .
At the same time a small group of Senate Democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon .
Sen. Bob Packwood R. Ore. the lead sponsor of the GOP proposal said he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along particularly this month 's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit .
He gave 10-to-1 odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year though it probably wo n't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill .
He added that he expects to talk to the Democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal .
For individuals the Packwood plan would exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year .
The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35 % .
The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 1989 .
As an alternative he said taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index .
For corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % .
That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years .
The Packwood plan would also include a proposal designed by Sen. William Roth R. Del. that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts .
The Roth plan would create a new non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses .
Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax .
For their part the group of Democrats are working on a plan that like the Packwood proposal would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies .
Newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held .
An extra exclusion would be given to long-held stock in small and medium-size corporations just starting up .
No one in the Senate is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the House .
That plan would provide a 30 % exclusion to assets sold over a 2 1\/2-year period ending Dec. 31 1991 .
After then the House measure would boost the tax rate to 28 % and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation .
Senators are focusing on making a capital-gains differential permanent .
Separately Chairman Dan Rostenkowski D. Ill .
of the House Ways and Means Committee said he did n't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit .
The current debt limit expires Oct. 31 .
He also urged House and Senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit including the House-passed capital-gains provision .
From a helicopter a thousand feet above Oakland after the second-deadliest earthquake in U.S. history a scene of devastation emerges a freeway crumbled into a concrete sandwich hoses pumping water into once-fashionable apartments abandoned autos .
But this quake was n't the big one the replay of 1906 that has been feared for so many years .
Despite the tragic loss of more than 270 lives and damage estimated in the billions most businesses and their plants and offices in the Bay area were n't greatly affected .
The economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two although some transportation problems may last weeks or months .
A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland .
Also the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage .
The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage broken windows falling brick and cornices buckled asphalt or sidewalks .
Of course the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's capital of high technology .
Like other major American cities the San Francisco Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors .
When the tremors struck the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air .
Michael L. Bandler vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co. says nearly all the network 's computer switches which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another changed to battery power when the city lost power .
The battery packs have enough power for only three hours but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel .
Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell 's network only four went down .
One of those was in Hollister Calif. near the earthquake 's epicenter .
Few telephone lines snapped .
That 's because the widely used fiber-optic cable has been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points .
The slack absorbs the pulling strain generated by an earthquake .
Nevertheless phone service was sporadic many computer terminals remained dark and by late yesterday a third of San Francisco remained without power .
Business in the nation 's fourth-largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home .
The economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself as virtually all businesses shut down .
The 125-billion-a-year Bay area economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation 's most populous state and accounts for 2 % to 3 % of the nation 's total output of goods and services according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto .
In high-tech the Bay area accounts for 15 % to 20 % of the U.S. computer-related industry .
This has been a major disruption for the Bay area economy says Pauline Sweezey the chief economist at the California Department of Finance .
Obviously things are going to have to go on hold for many companies .
The damage to the Bay area 's roadways could cause significant economic hardship .
A quarter of a million people cross the Bay Bridge every day far more than the 100,000 that use the Bay Area Rapid Transit system BART which was working but was n't stopping in the city 's Financial District yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being checked for gas leaks .
California state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless do n't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the Bay area .
All major roadways except Interstate 880 known as the Nimitz Freeway and the Bay Bridge were open by 1 p.m. yesterday .
Officials expect difficulty routing traffic through downtown San Francisco .
The earthquake caused many streets to buckle and crack making them impassible .
Other roads were obstructed by collapsed buildings and damaged water and power lines an emergency relief spokesman says .
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated the damage to his city alone at 2 billion .
But many predicted that the commercial disruption would be short-lived .
Of the scores of companies contacted by this newspaper few reported any damage that they did n't expect to have remedied within a day or two .
It is possible of course that some of the most seriously damaged companies could n't be reached particularly in areas nearest the epicenter .
Typical perhaps was the situation at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. the General Motors Corp.-Toyota joint-venture auto plant in Fremont about 35 miles south of Oakland .
Ten of the plant 's workers were injured when the quake hit about a half-hour into the afternoon shift seven were hospitalized .
Metal racks on the plant floor fell over and water mains ruptured a spokeswoman says .
The plant was evacuated and workers sent home .
But the plant was able to resume limited production of its Toyota Corollas and Geo Prizms by 6 a.m. yesterday and absenteeism was only 7 % of the work force about twice normal .
Computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. based in Palo Alto says one of its buildings sustained severe damage when it was knocked off its foundation .
Other buildings had broken glass dangling light fixtures and broken pipes a spokesperson says estimating the cost of reconstruction in the millions .
Most banks were closed but were expected to reopen today with few problems anticipated .
At the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Vice President Robert Fienberg says operations were steaming along as usual yesterday afternoon .
When the quake hit we turned on our emergency generator and brought our computers up he says .
The Fed serves as a middleman for banks taking checks from one bank and sending them to another an operation that it handled smoothly Tuesday night after the quake .
The volume we received from the banks was a lot lower than usual he says .
A disaster-contingency plan in which the Los Angeles Fed would come to San Francisco 's aid was n't needed he adds .
Most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from congestion .
The telephone network simply could n't handle the large number of people seeking to make a call at the same time .
The volume resulted in dial-tone delays that were as short as 15 seconds and as long as five minutes .
Mr. Bandler puts traffic volume at 10 to 50 times normal .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. MCI Communications Inc. and United Telecommunications ' U S Sprint unit were blocking phone calls into the Bay area to alleviate congestion .
The companies block traffic much as highway on-ramps are blocked when traffic backs up .
William E. Downing Pacific Bell 's vice president of customer services for the Bay area says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50 % of all calls .
Pacific Telesis says its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50 % of its calls locally .
Ironically the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area 's economic fortunes and indeed the nation 's gross national product .
It may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such as double-deck highways .
It would in the near-term give a boost to the San Francisco economy because there will be an influx of people to help says Beth Burnham Mace a regional economist at DRI\/McGraw Hill a Lexington Mass. forecasting firm .
The construction industry is sure to feel increased demand .
There will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state federal and local employment Ms. Mace says .
Adds Stacy Kotman an economist at Georgia State University There 's nothing positive about an earthquake but it will probably generate more construction activity .
Wall Street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies .
Shares of Lone Star Industries Inc. a cement maker rose sharply in anticipation of stepped-up demand .
In Greenwich Conn. Lone Star spokesman Michael London says Obviously with an earthquake of this size there are likely to be construction projects that would n't otherwise have been anticipated .
But any increase is n't likely to be any kind of a surge .
It 's something likely to be spread out over a long period of time .
There will be a lot of repair work that wo n't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new constructon would .
Lone Star 's San Francisco facilities were n't damaged in the quake .
The earthquake is likely to reduce GNP negligibly in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins .
The first effects are of course negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending .
Corporate profits may also dip initially .
Many of the lost tourism dollars wo n't be recovered many trips delayed never take place .
Subsequently however the ill effects are likely to be offset at least in economic terms as construction activity begins .
Because of the way the government keeps its books the damage to the Bay Bridge however costly wo n't be counted as a minus .
The money spent on repairs will be counted as a plus .
It 's very difficult to model the long-term impact of this says Andrew Goldberg who studies the public-policy and crisis-management aspects of earthquakes at the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington D.C .
You certainly can say it 's going to be extremely severe .
We really are talking about shutting down a major American city for a number of days maybe for a few weeks .
Mr. Goldberg says the cost of the earthquake will definitely top 1 billion and could reach 4 billion .
He cautions that early damage estimates are often low the damage totals in Hurricane Hugo increased tenfold as more information was received .
The earthquake damage of course would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown San Francisco .
A direct hit on a major city Mr. Goldberg figures would cause 20 billion to 40 billion of damage .
Experts caution that it is far too soon for reliable estimates of the quake 's total damage but it 's clear that insurers are likely to pay out enormous sums .
Jack Byrne the chairman of Fireman 's Fund Corp. which is based in Novato Calif. estimates insured losses resulting the earthquake could total 2 billion .
The impact on the insurance industry will be big and harsh but less than Hurricane Hugo says Mr. Byrne who toured the Bay area by car yesterday afternoon to get a sense of the company 's exposure to the earthquake .
Mr. Byrne says Fireman 's Fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims but after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines the company 's fourthquarter charge against earnings should n't top 50 million .
The company was able to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized maps of Northern California showing the exact locations of all the property it insures .
Fireman 's Fund had claims adjusters on the streets of San Francisco right after sunrise yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot .
Fireman 's Fund insures 37,300 homes and autos and 35,000 businesses in the Bay area .
In addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage the insurer must cover worker-compensation claims and also losses due to businesses being shut down by lack of power or phone service .
But many Californians may not have adequate insurance coverage to pay for damages to their property .
The Independent Insurance Agents of America says fewer than one of every five California homeowners has earthquake insurance .
A somewhat higher percentage of people living in the Bay area have bought the additional insurance protection but the great majority are n't covered .
Earthquake insurance typically runs 200 or more a year for a small house .
Whatever the long-term economic effect the scene from the helicopter above Oakland is one of tragedy .
Gargantuan sections of a double-decker freeway have been heaved about like plastic building blocks .
Atop them sit cars and trucks abandoned in a terrifying scramble to safety the day before .
In areas where the freeway made giant concrete sandwiches of itself lie cars that police say have been flattened into foot-thick slabs .
On the periphery rescue workers seem from the air to move in slow motion .
They peck away at the 1 1\/2-mile section of rubble searching for more of the 250 people thought to have died here .
About 20 other deaths were also attributed to the earthquake .
The heart of the earthquake 6.9 on the Richter scale was 50 miles to the south near Santa Cruz but its terrible fist struck here on the Nimitz Freeway a major artery serving the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco .
Along the way the quake toppled a mall in Santa Cruz knocked down buildings in San Francisco 's fashionable Marina District and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city 's Financial District .
Just a short span across the bay to the west the quake also showed its mettle A four-square-block area of the Marina District lies smoldering under a steady stream of seawater being pumped onto rubble to prevent it from blazing anew .
Many of the buildings mostly condominiums and apartments were flattened almost instantly as the underlying soil much of it landfill was literally turned to ooze by the quake 's intensive shaking rupturing gas lines .
Onlookers say three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fireball shortly after the quake struck .
Efforts to fight the blaze were hampered because water mains were severed as well .
From the air ribbons of yellow fire hose carry water from the bay to high-pressure nozzles trained on the site .
As onlookers stand behind barricades helmeted firemen and building inspectors survey rows of nearby buildings that were twisted from their foundations and seem on the verge of collapse .
In the Marina District residents spent yesterday assessing damage cleaning up and trying to find friends and neighbors .
Evelyn Boccone 85 years old has lived in the district most of her life .
Her parents lost everything in the 1906 earthquake .
Now we realize what our mothers must have gone through she says .
We always heard about the earthquake but as children we did n't always listen .
PRINCE HENRI is the crown prince and hereditary grand duke of Luxembourg .
An article in the World Business Report of Sept. 22 editions incorrectly referred to his father Grand Duke Jean as the crown prince .
Resolution Funding Corp. plans to sell 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday in the agency 's first sale of securities .
The new bonds will be dated Oct. 30 and mature Oct. 15 2019 .
Tenders for the bonds available in minimum denominations of 1,000 must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Wednesday at Federal Reserve banks .
Refcorp created by the thrift-overhaul law enacted in August will use the proceeds to merge or sell off ailing savings-and-loan institutions .
Congress authorized 50 billion to be borrowed to pay for the thrift bailout .
Of that amount 20 billion has already been borrowed by the Treasury Department .
Unless otherwise specified in a particular offer the bonds wo n't be subject to redemption prior to maturity .
Interest payments on the bonds will be payable semiannually .
The bonds are subject to federal taxation in the U.S. including income taxes .

G.D. Searle & Co. a Monsanto Co. unit is launching a program to give consumers more information about its drugs when doctors prescribe them .
Called Patients in the Know the program features fact sheets designed to be easy to understand .
The sheets tell how the medicine works describe how to use it and list its possible side effects .
They are designed to be given to patients by their doctors when the medicines are prescribed and include space for the doctor to write special instructions .
In addition Searle will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores .
Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients .
We believe that every drug that 's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label said Douglas Teich of the Public Citizen Health Research Group a Ralph Nader affiliate .
Dr. Teich said Searle is the only company I know that voluntarily will make consumer information available .
According to federal officials and drug-industry studies nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year are n't used properly meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication .
We think it 's very important to provide as much information as possible on the drugs consumers take said Searle Chairman Sheldon Gilgore .
Bond prices rambled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply .
Early yesterday bonds rose as investors rushed to buy Treasury securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive California earthquake .
For example some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies which face massive damage claims would get hit hard .
But when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose instead bonds drifted lower .
With stocks not a major focus we 're waiting for the next guiding light said Brian J. Fabbri chief economist at
