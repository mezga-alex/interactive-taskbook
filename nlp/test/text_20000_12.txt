d too furriers complain .
And those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages .
The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs in the U.S. .
is not as available as it was says Mr. Schreibman who is starting overseas production .
But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump fear that furs are losing part of their allure .
People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business says Stephen Sanders divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago .
You ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury insists Mr. Purnick the New York furrier .
He contends that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs .
But Mr. Rosen responds Whatever people want to buy I 'll sell .
The name of the game is to move goods .
Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection company and city officials said .
The four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities .
GTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by GTE 's private food vending contractor ARA Services Inc. was suffering from a strain of the virus officials said .
More than 700 people work in the GTE building .
The cafeteria remains closed .
Dr. Andrew McBride city health director said his staff suspects the hepatitis which can be highly contagious was spread by the cafeteria worker with the virus .
The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week Dr. McBride said .
Hepatitis A considered the least dangerous strain of the virus has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee company and city officials said .
From a public health point of view we 're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening said Dr. Frank Provato GTE 's medical director .
It 's a double-edged sword though because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis .
GTE officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company said GTE spokesman Thomas Mattausch .
The company has begun offering shots of gamma globulin which will diminish the flu-like symptoms of hepatitis A in anyone who has contracted the disease Mr. Mattausch said .
We 're strongly recommending that anyone who has eaten in the cafeteria this month have the shot Mr. Mattausch added and that means virtually everyone who works here .
I was appalled to read the misstatements of facts in your Oct. 13 editorial Colombia 's Brave Publisher .
It is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers not the left wing .
This information was gleaned from your own news stories on the region .
Past Colombian government tolerance of the narcotraficantes was due to the drug lords ' history of wiping out leftists in the hinterlands .

In the wake of a slide in sterling a tailspin in the stock market and a string of problematic economic indicators British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy .
In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy using high interest rates as the essential instrument to carry out the campaign .
Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % he pledged that rates will have to remain high for some time to come .
Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation he argued .
In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency he stated that the exchange rates will have a major role in the assessment of monetary conditions .
In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy .
He said he monitors the money-supply figures but does n't give them paramount importance as some private and government economists have suggested .
Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system .
Mr. Lawson 's speech delivered at the Lord Mayor of London 's annual dinner at Mansion House came on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy .
Two weeks ago in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15 % .
Despite the increase the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week .
It was quoted at 2.9428 marks in late New York trading Wednesday .
Leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the British war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed .
Unemployment in September dropped to 1,695,000 the lowest level since 1980 .
While lower joblessness is generally good news the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as hoped despite a doubling of interest rates over the last 16 months .
Meanwhile average earnings in Britain were up 8.75 % in August over the previous year .
Another inflationary sign came in a surge in building-society lending to a record 10.2 billion 16.22 billion last month a much higher level than economists had predicted .
In a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner Robin Leigh-Pemberton Bank of England governor conceded that demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated when the British economy was heating up last year .
He added that there 's no quick-fix solution to the economic woes and said tight monetary policy is the right approach .
Discussing the recent slide in stock prices the central bank governor stated that the markets now appear to have steadied after the nasty jolt of the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average a week ago .
Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy .
Specifically he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings .
Discussing future monetary arrangements Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System but he did n't indicate when .

C. Olivetti & Co. claiming it has won the race in Europe to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip unveiled its CP486 computer yesterday .
The product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp. 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor which works several times faster than previously available chips .
Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year .
An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine and that it should be available in Europe by December .
What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do the spokesman said .
The new chip is a very big step in computing and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product said Patricia Meagher Davis an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London .
Executives at Olivetti whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market .
Ms. Davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti 's own minicomputers but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers stockbrokers and medical doctors .
Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year she believes Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December .
We think the worst is over in the European information-technology market she said .
Depending on the type of software and peripherals used the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals a role usually filled by a minicomputer as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer .
It 's the missing link in Olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers the Olivetti spokesman said .
He added that Olivetti will continue making its LSX minicomputer line .
The machines will cost around 16,250 on average in Europe .
The Intel 486 chip can process 15 million instructions per second or MIPS while Intel 's previous 386 chip could handle only 3 to 6 MIPS .
Olivetti also plans to sell the CP486 computer in the U.S. starting next year through Olivetti USA and through its ISC\/Bunker Ramo unit which specializes in automating bank-branch networks .
Viatech Inc. said it received approval from the French government for its proposed 44.7 million acquisition of Ferembal S.A .
The approval satisfies the remaining conditions of the purchase which is expected to close within two weeks .
erembal the second-largest maker of food cans in France had 1988 sales of 150 million .
Ferembal has 930 workers at four canning manufacturing plants and one plastic container facility .
Viatech makes flexible packaging films and machinery and materials for the food and pharmaceutical industries .
Social Security benefits will rise 4.7 % next year to keep pace with inflation boosting the average monthly benefit to 566 from 541 the Department of Health and Human Services announced .
The higher payments will start with Social Security checks received on Jan. 3 1990 .
Supplemental Security Income payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7 % starting with checks received on Dec. 29 1988 increasing the maximum SSI payment to 386 from 368 a month .
The inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the Social Security trust fund will rise to 50,400 in 1990 from 48,000 this year .
As mandated by law the tax rate will rise to 7.65 % in 1990 from 7.51 % and wo n't rise any further in the future .
This means that the maximum yearly Social Security tax paid by workers and employers each will rise 250.80 next year to 3,855.60 .
Beneficiaries aged 65 through 69 will be able to earn 9,360 without losing any Social Security benefits in 1990 up from 8,880 this year .
The exempt amount for beneficiaries under 65 will rise to 6,840 from 6,480 .
The adjustments reflect the increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year .
Health-care companies should get healthier in the third quarter .
Medical-supply houses are expected to report earnings increases of about 15 % on average for the third quarter despite sales increases of less than 10 % analysts say .
To offset sluggish sales growth companies have been cutting staff mostly through attrition and slowing the growth in research and development spending .
Sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers such as hospitals to hold down prices .
Suppliers were also hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar which makes sales abroad more difficult .
In some cases competition has squeezed margins .
Becton Dickinson & Co. for example faces stiff competition from a Japanese supplier in the important syringe market .
The Franklin Lakes N.J. company is expected to report sales growth of only 5 % to 6 % but should still maintain earnings growth of 10 % says Jerry E. Fuller an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc .
Among the first of the group to post results Abbott Laboratories said third-quarter net income jumped 14 % to 196 million or 88 cents a share from 172 million or 76 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales for the company based in Abbott Park Ill. rose 8.3 % to 1.31 billion from 1.21 billion .
Baxter International Inc. yesterday reported net climbed 20 % in the third period to 102 million or 34 cents a share from 85 million or 28 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales for the Deerfield Ill. company rose 5.8 % to 1.81 billion from 1.71 billion .
But not every company expects to report increased earnings .
C.R. Bard Inc. yesterday said third-quarter net plunged 51 % to 9.9 million or 18 cents a share from 20 million or 35 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales fell 1.2 % to 190.1 million from 192.5 million .
The Murray Hill N.J. company said full-year earnings may be off 33 cents a share because the company removed a catheter from the market .
In 1988 the company earned 1.38 a share .
The Food and Drug Administration had raised questions about the device 's design .
Some analysts add that third-party pressures to reduce health costs will continue to bedevil companies ' bottom lines .
Takeover speculation which has been buoying stocks of supply houses may also ease says Peter Sidoti an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
As that wanes you 're going to see the stocks probably wane as well he says .
Hospitals companies meanwhile are reporting improved earnings .
Bolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals National Medical Enterprises Inc. Los Angeles reported net income of 50 million or 65 cents a share for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 up from 41 million or 56 cents a share a year earlier .
Humana Inc. Louisville Ky. also reported favorable results with net income of 66.7 million or 66 cents in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 up from 58.2 million or 59 cents a year earlier .
Analysts say the handful of hospital companies that are still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends .
Most important hospital admission rates are stabilizing after several years of decline .
Moreover companies have sold off many of their smaller less-profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings .
Humana 's revenues for example are being boosted by large increases in enrollments in the company 's health maintenance organizations .
Says Todd Richter an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds The shakeout in the publicly traded companies is over .
Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 396,000 during the week ended Oct. 7 from 334,000 the previous week the Labor Department said .
The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 or 2.2 % of those covered by unemployment insurance from 2,205,000 the previous week when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2 % .
Counting all state and federal benefit programs the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier .
These figures are n't seasonally adjusted .
A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states particularly North Carolina and South Carolina .
The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits the official said .
Digital Equipment Corp. reported a 32 % decline in net income on a modest revenue gain in its fiscal first quarter causing some analysts to predict weaker results ahead than they had expected .
Although the second-largest computer maker had prepared Wall Street for a poor quarter analysts said they were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders .
The Maynard Mass. company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on mid-range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes .
Net for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to 150.8 million or 1.20 a share from 223 million or 1.71 a share a year ago .
Revenue rose 6.4 % to 3.13 billion from 2.94 billion .
Digital said a shift in its product mix toward low-end products and strong growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins .
A spokesman also said margins for the company 's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector .
The lack of a strong product at the high end of Digital 's line was a significant drag on sales .
Digital hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe-class computers next Tuesday .
The new line is aimed directly at International Business Machines Corp .
Until the new mainframe products kick in there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end and that 's hurt us said Mark Steinkrauss Digital 's director of investor relations .
He said unfavorable currency translations were also a factor in the quarter .
DEC shares rose 1.375 to 89.75 apiece in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday .
But analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly 40-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength .
Some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead .
I think the next few quarters will be difficult said Steven Milunovich of First Boston .
Margins will remain under pressure and when the new mainframe does ship I 'm not sure it will be a big winner .
Mr. Milunovich said he was revising his estimate for DEC 's current year from 8.20 a share to well below 8 although he has n't settled on a final number .
One troubling aspect of DEC 's results analysts said was its performance in Europe .
DEC said its overseas business which now accounts for more than half of sales improved in the quarter .
It even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in Europe were up in double digits in foreign-currency terms .
That gain probably translated into about 5 % to 7 % in dollar terms well below recent quarters ' gains of above 20 % reckons Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds .
That was a disappointment and a sign of overall computer-market softness in Europe Mr. Stevens said .
Marc Schulman with UBS Securities in New York dropped his estimate of DEC 's full-year net to 6.80 a share from 8 .
Although overall revenues were stronger Mr. Schulman said DEC drew down its European backlog and had flat world-wide orders overall .
The bottom line is that it 's more hand to mouth than it has been before
