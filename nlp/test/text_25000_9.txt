d by the New York Business Group a non-profit organization with about 300 members .
The stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress are much more prevalent than they seem said Leon J. Warshaw executive director of the business group .
In presenting the study late last week Dr. Warshaw estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial .
Occupational disability related to anxiety depression and stress costs about 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation .
In terms of days lost on the job the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress anxiety or depression .
He added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims .
We hope to sensitize employers to recognize the problems so they can do something about them Dr. Warshaw said .
Early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with hospitalization which sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too long .
Even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance .
But although 56 % of the respondents in the study indicated that mental-health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace there is still a social stigma associated with people seeking help .
The disorders which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people now strike people at the height of productivity says Robert M.A. Hirschfeld of the National Institute of Mental Health who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings .
The poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem with 65 % of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying stress-related problems were fairly pervasive and 55 % of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing .
The poll also noted fear of a takeover as a stress-producing event in larger companies .
More than eight in 10 respondents reported such a stress-provoking situation in their company .
Mid-sized companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings .
The study which received funding from Upjohn Co. which makes several drugs to treat stress-related illnesses also found 47 % of the managers said stress anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production .
Alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30 % of those polled .
Although Dr. Warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout .
He also noted that various work environments such as night work have their own stressors .
We all like stress but there 's a limit says Paul D'Arcy of Rohrer Hibler & Replogle a corporate psychology and management consulting firm .
The problem says Mr. D'Arcy a psychologist is that it 's very hard to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance .
For Cheap Air Fares Spend Christmas Aloft IT IS N'T TRUE that a 90-year old clergyman on a mission of mercy to a disaster area on Christmas Day can fly free .
But his circumstances are among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in America .
In recent years carriers have become much more picky about who can fly on the cheap .
But there still are a few ways today 's traveler can qualify under the airline 's many restrictions .
One of the best deals though may mean skipping Christmas dinner with the relatives .
This week many carriers are announcing cut-rate fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed and slowest days of the year including Christmas .
In recent years the airlines had waited until the last moment to court Christmas season vacationers with bargain fares .
That approach flopped Last Christmas Day a USAir Group Inc. DC-9 jetliner flew about seven passengers from Chicago to Pittsburgh .
So this year the airlines are getting a jump on holiday discounts .
They are cutting ticket prices by as much as 70 % from normal levels for travel to most U.S. locations on Dec. 24 25 29 30 and 31 and Jan. 4 5 and 6 .
The promotions dubbed everything from 'T- is the Season to be Jolly to Kringle fares put round-trip fares at 98 148 and 198 .
They 're trying to keep planes flying on days they 'd normally park them says Roger Bard president of Mr. Mitchell Travel Service in Burnsville N.C .
Expect of course sky-high prices on other dates near the holidays when the airlines know vacationers are eager to travel .
Consider Adopting Your Spouse 's Name IF CONTINENTAL Airlines has its way couples like Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue may find it a hassle to qualify for some new discounts .
Continental a Texas Air Corp. unit recently unveiled a marketing program offering free companion tickets to business-class and first-class passengers on international flights .
The Continental catch Only immediate family members are allowed and they must have the same last name as the buyer of the ticket or legal proof they 're related .
That irritates many women who have n't taken their husbands ' last name .
What a bunch of nonsense says Jessica Crosby president of the New York chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners .
This sets things way back .
Continental 's logic It does n't want business companions abusing the promotion by falsely claiming to be related .
We accommodate their choice of names by allowing them to demonstrate family affiliation with legal documents says Jim O'Donnell a senior vice president .
But gay rights advocates are angry too .
The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund of New York City has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline does n't recognize as family .
It 's certainly discrimination says attorney Evan Wolfson whose group forced Trans World Airlines this year to change a rule that allowed travelers to transfer frequent flier awards only to family members .
Take Your Vacation In a Hurricane Area WHEN HURRICANE Hugo careened through the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast states it downed electric and telephone lines shot coconuts through cottage rooftops shattered windows and uprooted thousands of lives .
It also lowered some air fares .
Since the hurricane Midway Airlines Inc. and American Airlines a unit of AMR Corp. trimmed their one-way fares to the Virgin Islands to 109 from prices that were at times double that before the storm .
The fares are code-named Hugo Compassion and Virgin Islands Aid .
Airlines are n't lowering fares to Northern California following this week 's earthquake but reservation agents can waive advance-purchase restrictions on discount fares for emergency trips .
Some hotels in the hurricane-stricken Caribbean promise money-back guarantees .
In Myrtle Beach S.C. the damaged Yachtsman Resort offers daily rates as low as 35 or as much as 22 % below regular prices .
Says Michele Hoffman a clerk in the resort 's front office We do n't have the outdoor pool the pool table ping pong table snack bar or VCR but we still have the indoor pool and Jacuzzi .
Just Wait Until You 're a Bit Older SENIOR CITIZENS have long received cheap air fares .
This year the older someone is the bigger the discount .
A senior citizen between 62 and 70 saves 70 % off regular coach fare .
Travelers up to age 99 get a percentage discount matching their age .
And centenarians fly free in first class .
Next month Northwest Airlines says a 108-year-old Lansing Mich. woman is taking it up on the offer to fly with her 72-year-old son to Tampa Fla .
Last year when Northwest first offered the promotion only six centenarians flew free .
If All Else Fails .
THE NATION'S carriers also provide discounts to Red Cross workers retired military personnel and medical students .
There 's even a special fare for clergy that does n't require the usual stay over Saturday night .
That way they can be home in time for work Sunday .
The British Petroleum Co. PLC said its BP Exploration unit has produced the first oil from its Don oilfield in the North Sea .
In an official release BP said initial production from the field was 11,000 barrels a day and that it expects peak output from the field of 15,000 barrels a day to be reached in 1990 .
As the sponsor of the Older Americans Freedom to Work Act which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil .
For every dollar earned over 8,880 Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits it 's like a 50 % marginal tax .
But the compounded effects of seniors only taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates .
Imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax .
Although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage largely due to the earnings limit she would have to earn an additional 4,930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of 496 .
Eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit .
Repeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased Social Security benefit payments .
We now need support from the Democrats on the Rules Committee in order to include earnings-limit reform in the Reconciliation Bill .
Since all four Republicans on the committee are co-sponsors of my bill it is the Democrats who will be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor .
The time is now to lift the burdensome Social Security earnings limit from the backs of our nation 's seniors .
Rep. J. Dennis Hastert R. Ill .
When his Seventh Avenue fur business here was flying high 20 years ago Jack Purnick had 25 workers and a large factory .
Now his half-dozen employees work in an eighth-floor shop that he says is smaller than his old storage room .
He also says he is losing money now .
He blames imports .
But just down Seventh Avenue where about 75 % of U.S. fur garments are made Larry Rosen has acquired two retail outlets broadened his fur-making line and expanded into leather .
He credits imports .
The difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10 years .
One stuck to old-line business traditions while the other embraced the change .
The small good fur salon is not what it used to be says Mr. Purnick 75 years old .
We make the finest product in the world and the Americans are being kicked around .
Mr. Rosen though believes imports have reinvigorated the industry in which he has worked for most of his 57 years .
You 've got some minds here that wo n't think progressively he says .
Import competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing working-girl mink and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years .
Merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers the younger woman even in her late 20s who never thought she could buy a mink .
The new market helped boost U.S. fur sales to about 1.8 billion a year now triple the level in the late 1970s .
It also opened the door to furs made in South Korea China Hong Kong and other countries .
Jindo Furs a large South Korean maker says it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next year .
Mr. Purnick and other old-line furriers call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made .
High-end U.S. furriers say these imports have n't squeezed them .
But low-priced and middle-priced furriers like Mr. Purnick who once saturated the five-block Seventh Avenue fur district say imports have cut their sales .
A woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a U.S.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than 2,000 .
Yet Mr. Rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage .
Early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their American counterparts and were more open to innovation .
In 1982 he started a factory in Greece .
Two years later he opened one in West Germany .
He also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur and he decided to follow suit .
By combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost .
To maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources he says he still makes most of his furs in the U.S. .
But six years ago he also began importing from the Far East .
Inspired by imports Mr. Rosen now makes fur muffs hats and flings .
This year he produced a men 's line and offers dyed furs in red cherry red violet royal blue and forest green .
He has leather jackets from Turkey that are lined with eel skin and topped off with raccoon-skin collars .
From Asia he has mink jackets with floral patterns made by using different colored furs .
Next he will be testing pictured embroidery called kalega made in the Far East .
He plans to attach the embroidery to the backs of mink coats and jackets .
Besides adding to sales leathers also attract retailers who may buy furs later he adds .
Other furriers have also benefited from leathers .
Seymour Schreibman the 65-year-old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc. treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment .
He says it accounts for 25 % of total sales .
Mr. Rosen is also pushing retail sales .
This year he bought two stores one in Brooklyn and one in Queens .
Other furriers have also placed more weight on retailing .
Golden Feldman Furs Inc. began retailing aggressively eight years ago and now retail sales account for about 20 % of gross income .
In other moves Mr. Rosen says he bought a truck three years ago to reach more retailers .
Since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the Midwest .
Small retailers who ca n't afford to travel to his New York showroom have become fair game .
Such moves have helped Mr. Rosen weather the industry slump of recent years .
The industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980 but since 1986 sales have languished at their 1.8 billion peak .
Large furriers such as Antonovich Inc. Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years .
Aftereffects of the 1987 stock market crash head the list of reasons .
In addition competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats driving prices down .
The animal-rights movement has n't helped sales .
Warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand too furriers complain .
And those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages .
The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs in the U.S. .
is not as available as it was says Mr. Schreibman who is starting overseas production .
But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump fear that furs are losing part of their allure .
People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business says Stephen Sanders divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago .
You ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury insists Mr. Purnick the New York furrier .
He contends that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs .
But Mr. Rosen responds Whatever people want to buy I 'll sell .
The name of the game is to move goods .
Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection company and city officials said .
The four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities .
GTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by GTE 's private food vending contractor ARA Services Inc. was suffering from a strain of the virus officials said .
More than 700 people work in the GTE building .
The cafeteria remains closed .
Dr. Andrew McBride city health director said his staff suspects the hepatitis which can be highly contagious was spread by the cafeteria worker with the virus .
The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week Dr. McBride said .
Hepatitis A considered the least dangerous strain of the virus has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee company and city officials said .
From a public health point of view we 're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening said Dr. Frank Provato GTE 's medical director .
It 's a double-edged sword though because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis .
GTE officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company said GTE spokesman Thomas Mattausch .
The company has begun offering shots of gamma globulin which will diminish the flu-like symptoms of hepatitis A in anyone who has contracted the disease Mr. Mattausch said .
We 're strongly recommending that anyone who has eaten in the cafeteria this month have the shot Mr. Mattausch added and that means virtually everyone who works here .
I was appalled to read the misstatements of facts in your Oct. 13 editorial Colombia 's Brave Publisher .
It is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers not the left wing .
This information was gleaned from your own news stories on the region .
Past Colombian government tolerance of the narcotraficantes was due to the drug lords ' history of wiping out leftists in the hinterlands .

In the wake of a slide in sterling a tailspin in the stock market and a string of problematic economic indicators British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy .
In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy using high interest rates as the essential instrument to carry out the campaign .
Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % he pledged that rates will have to remain high for some time to come .
Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation he argued .
In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency he stated that the exchange rates will have a major role in the assessment of monetary conditions .
In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy .
He said he monitors the money-supply figures but does n't give them paramount importance as some private and government economists have suggested .
Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system .
Mr. Lawson 's speech delivered at the Lord Mayor of London 's annual dinner at Mansion House came on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy .
Two weeks ago in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15 % .
Despite the increase the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week .
It was quoted at 2.9428 marks in late New York trading Wednesday .
Leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the British war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed .
Unemployment in September dropped to 1,695,000 the lowest level since 1980 .
While lower joblessness is generally good news the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as hoped despite a doubling of interest rates over the last 16 months .
Meanwhile average earnings in Britain were up 8.75 % in August over the previous year .
Another inflationary sign came in a surge in building-society lending to a record 10.2 billion 16.22 billion last month a much higher level than economists had predicted .
In a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner Robin Leigh-Pemberton Bank of England governor conceded that demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated when the British economy was heating up last year .
He added that there 's no quick-fix solution to the economic woes and said tight monetary policy is the right approach .
Discussing the recent slide in stock prices the central bank governor stated that the markets now appear to have steadied after the nasty jolt of the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average a week ago .
Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy .
Specifically he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings .
Discussing future monetary arrangements Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System but he did n't indicate when .

C. Olivetti & Co. claiming it has won the race in Europe to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip unveiled its CP486 computer yesterday .
The product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp. 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor which works several times faster than previously available chips .
Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year .
An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine and that it should be available in Europe by December .
What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do the spokesman said .
The new chip is a very big step in computing and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product said Patricia Meagher Davis an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London .
Executives at Olivetti whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market .
Ms. Davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti 's own minicomputers but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers stockbrokers and medical doctors .
Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year she believes Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December .
We think the worst is over in the European information-technology market she said .
Depending on the type of software and peripherals used the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals a role usually filled by a minicomputer as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer .
It 's the missing link in Olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers the Olivetti spokesman said .
He added that Olivetti will
