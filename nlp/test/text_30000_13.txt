ng quarters .
Westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region .
The operating territory includes coal terminals on the Ohio River and in Newport News Va .
Westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas .
For the past couple of years Westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business .
Marginal operations and assets have been sold .
The size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 .
About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated .
Even perks have been reduced .
For example the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits the company used to pay 100 % .
I think the ship is now righted the bilges are pumped and we are on course Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program .
Much of what we set out to do is completed .
But he cautioned that Westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth so investors should n't just multiply the third quarter by four and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained .
One difference he said is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season .
I do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now he said .
We have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient .
It 's a process that never really ends .
Nevertheless Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be solidly profitable for Westmoreland and that 1990 would bring more of the same .
For all of 1988 the company reported an after-tax operating loss of 134,000 on revenue of 593.5 million .
An accounting adjustment made net income 1.5 million or 18 cents a share .
In a move that complements the company 's basic strategy its Westmoreland Energy Inc. unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in Virginia .
Some of the coal the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines .
Mr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s will be exciting .
He said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the Mississippi River .
Westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s .
We see coal 's piece of the action growing Mr. Hutchinson said .
Coal prices while not skyrocketing will grow modestly in real terms we think .
Chase Manhattan Corp. after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower Manhattan operations building has exercised its option to purchase the 50-story office tower .
Chase had purchased an option to buy the building at One New York Plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late Sol Atlas as part of its original lease in 1970 .
The current transaction cost the bank approximately 140 million .
Of that amount 20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself .
The building houses about 4,500 Chase workers most of whom will be moved to downtown Brooklyn after the bank 's new back office center is completed in 1993 .
The move is part of Chase 's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof .
The headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza .
As part of its decision to leave the building Chase tried to sell its interest along with the Atlas estate 's interest shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash .
Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations .
He said Chase and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for 400 million to 475 million but did n't get an offer for more than 375 million .
As the building 's new owner Chase will have its work cut out for it .
Chase is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space and Salomon Brothers Inc. whose headquarters is in the building also plans to move shortly .
In addition another major building tenant Thomson McKinnon Inc. 's Thomson McKinnon Securities likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation .
New York real estate brokerage Edward S. Gordon Co. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants .
Even with its striking views of the New York harbor the building is considered antiquated by modern office standards .
And Chase will have to spend approximately 50 million to remove asbestos from the premises .
WALL STREET SHAKE hands with George Orwell .
The author of the futuristic novel 1984 invented a language called Newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought that is anything negative about the policies and practices of the state .
Wall Street has n't gotten that far yet but it has made a promising start .
Its language call it Streetspeak is increasingly mellifluous reassuring and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better safer or cheaper than they really are .
When something undeniably nasty happens a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers .
For example we 'll bet you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago .
Wrong .
According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market it never happened .
In their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19 1987 was just a big blip .
Trotting out a much-beloved Streetspeak term New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan recently declared that history would record the event as only a major technical correction .
Another much-beloved saying however this one in plain English holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it is a duck .
On Oct. 29 1929 a date historians stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded C-word the DJ industrials fell 12.8 % .
In the technical correction of two years ago they lost a whopping 22.6 % .
Customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock .
These people used to be called brokers but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction when terrified customers could n't raise brokers on the phone .
Either way the word broker is clearly out of favor .
Of the major New York-based securities firms only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers .
At Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. they are financial consultants .
At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Prudential Bache Securities and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. they are account executives .
At PaineWebber Inc. they are investment executives .
Such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified broad-scale competence and expertise in selling today 's myriad financial products .
It is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up for them to peddle do n't feel .
It s almost product de jour grouses one account executive at Dean Witter .
The transmogrified brokers never let the C-word cross their lips instead stressing such terms as safe insured and guaranteed even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product .
The names of some of these products do n't suggest the risk involved in buying them either .
A case in point government-plus bond funds .
What could imply more safety than investing in government bonds .
What could be better than getting a tad more income from them the plus than other people .
Indeed conservative investors many of them elderly have poured more than 50 billion into such funds which promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options a gambler 's game .
When a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker .
This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments .
They are still being sold but more and more often as direct investments with all the same risks they had under the old label .
In such cases the game has n't changed only the name .
In others a familiar old name still prevails but the underlying game has changed .
For example no load mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a frontend sales commission .
Getting out of them however may be a different story now .
Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee usually a modest one they imposed no other fees and many still do n't .
In recent years though a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges all the way up to 6 % when an investor sells his shares .
Should n't they properly be called exit-load funds .
The mutual-fund industry is debating the question but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well .
And do n't expect anyone to change the term blue chip either even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for one is still a favorite of widows orphans and trust departments but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture .
Also blue chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent years .
Larry Biehl a money manager in San Mateo Calif. blames that on the advent of program trading in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail .
Blue chips he says are now being referred to as poker chips .
Finally even the time-honored strategy called value investing no longer means what it once did .
Before the takeover mania of the '80s it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks especially those with shrewd management sound fundamentals and decent prospects .
Now says Mr. Biehl value investing often means looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble .
To institutional investors or brokers he adds a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up .
Ms. Bettner covers personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's Los Angeles bureau .
I was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries .
If the whole story were told it would read something like this During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and Use of Proceeds confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made .
The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings and management bonuses the price a sea of bad loans .
For the past several years the banks lacking a private navy to enforce their interests have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury to underwrite their bad LDC credits .
The Treasury wisely has refused but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans the Brady Plan .
The banks will threaten not to make further loans but in truth lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy they have no alternative but to go along .
George A. Wiegers Gillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to its board increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11 .
Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought 600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11 % stake and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board .
Separately Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2 % to 65.2 million or 57 cents a share from 63.9 million or 57 cents a share in the year-earlier period per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a 10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period .
Sales rose 9 % to 921.6 million from 845.7 million with sales of the company 's international\/diversified operations well above the year earlier-period .
For the nine months Gillette 's net income declined 1 % to 205.3 million or 2.02 a share from 207 million or 1.82 a share in the 1988 period .
Sales rose 6 % to 2.77 billion from 2.61 billion .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange the company closed yesterday at 45.50 a share up 25 cents .
When Walter Yetnikoff the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a 3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio Mr. Guber jumped at the chance .
Within two days he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony .
And before the week was out Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner Jon Peters the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business .
Not only that Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia 's future profits and buy their company Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for 200 million almost 40 % more than the market value of the company .
There was just one sticking point The two had a prior commitment .
Just seven months earlier they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for Warner Bros. for which they had just produced the smash hit Batman .
But Mr. Guber figured that Warner Communications Inc. chairman Steven Ross would empathize and let the producers go knowing the Sony offer was the culmination of a life 's work .
He figured wrong .
Last week following fruitless settlement talks Warner now merging with Time Inc. filed a 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters .
Sony promptly countersued charging Warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the U.S. movie business .
The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides As one Sony executive puts it It 's World War III .
That two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside Hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business .
And they are a very odd team in any case .
Mr. Guber was raised in Boston and educated in New York .
He is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees .
Mr. Peters is a high-school dropout who came to fame as Barbra Streisand 's hairdresser .
Yet they are far and away the most prolific producers in Hollywood .
And despite their share of duds they make movies that make money .
That is a skill Sony badly needs and Warner is loath to lose .
Although Columbia had a good summer with Ghostbusters II and When Harry Met Sally rivals such as Warner Paramount Pictures Walt Disney Co. and Universal Studios have been thrashing Columbia at the box office .
After five years of management turmoil with four different studio heads Columbia sorely needs a stable savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters are n't universally loved in Hollywood but they are well connected .
Their stock in trade as executive producers is sniffing out hot properties locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them .
Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a Flashdance or buy rights to a best seller such as The Color Purple .
It falls to others to do the writing directing and producing .
With MGM\/UA 's Rainman for instance Messrs. Guber and Peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production but their names still appear in big letters on the credits and they are inevitably associated with its success .
Sometimes as with Batman the pair really do make the film .
In that case Guber Peters acquired the rights in 1979 nursed the movie through a dozen scripts and were on the set in London for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production .
They 're the best production talent around says Brian De Palma beholden to Guber Peters for hiring him to direct the Warner movie of Tom Wolfe 's novel Bonfire of the Vanities .
On that film which is to start shooting in a few months they 've been very much involved hiring talent and discussing the development of the script .
And when you 're making a movie this big you need all the help you can get Mr. De Palma adds .
I wish they were around 24 hours a day .
And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention .
Warner executives blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in Caddyshack II for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure .
We 've had a few bombs admits Mr. Peters .
But by and large this company has only been profitable .
He says his company 's prowess at packaging and marketing is why we 'll be good at Columbia .
We practically ran our own studio .
Longtime Hollywood associates describe Mr. Guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing .
Peter is a major piece of Hollywood manpower who has really earned his success says Robert Bookman an agent at Creative Artists Agency .
Mark Johnson the producer of Rainman chimes in He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority .
It 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material .
Mr. Peters on the other hand has fewer fans in Hollywood and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully .
He gets better reviews as a creative whiz an enthusiast an idea man .
He also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did .
Barbra Streisand made him famous .
He cut her hair .
He lived with her .
He came to produce her records and her movies A Star Is Born and The Main Event .
Thrice married but now single Mr. Peters got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress Kim Basinger during the making of Batman .
Mr. Guber by contrast has been married to one woman for more than 20 years .
But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences they make the perfect good cop bad cop team Hollywood associates say .
Peter is the bright sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal says one agent .
If there 's a problem Peter disappears and all of a sudden Jon shows up .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way .
Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer who shepherded Flashdance through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie bristle when Messrs. Guber and Peters take credit for the film .
Says Mr. Simpson The script was unreadable .
We reinvented it .
We are the producers of that movie .
They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit as executive producers .
When Roger Birnbaum an executive who worked for Guber Peters in the early 1980s left to take a job as head of production at the United Artists studio they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop including Rainman and Batman .
Mr. Peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner .
I was upset with Roger I fumpered and schmumpered says Mr. Peters .
But he wanted to pursue his own dream and he went .
Still Mr. Birnbaum says his relationship with Guber Peters was one of the most successful I 've had in Hollywood .
The two have a wonderful chemistry Jon is very impulsive and Peter is very compulsive adds Mr. Birnbaum who is now head of production at News Corp. 's 20th Century Fox Film Co .
Jon Peters will come barreling into a room say he 's got a great idea and be gone .
Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific .
Mr. Birnbaum recalls that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey which became Gorillas in the Mist .
He says Within a few weeks we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey .
I think Peter even made some deals with the gorillas .
Universal Studios was working on a competing film but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with Guber Peters and Warner .
More recently Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest .
Messrs. Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man 's widow for months showing her a tape of Gorillas in the Mist to impress her with the quality of their work .
Money helped too .
Ultimately they paid more than 1 million for the rights .
The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband 's followers .
Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest .
It 's hardly astonishing given the men 's track record that Sony wants Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters .
But it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first .
Some note that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract .
But though people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters it 's good to have a partner and obviously the chemistry works says Steven Tisch a producer who once worked for Mr. Guber .
This business is n't about personalities at the end of the day it s about whether the ink is red or black .
In the case of Peter and Jon the ink has been very very black .
Mr. Guber got his start in the movie business at Columbia two decades ago .
Recruited from New York University 's MBA program he rose within two years to head of production overseeing such films as The Way We Were Taxi Driver Tommy and Shampoo .
In 1976 he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks later called Polygram Pictures where they produced such hits as as The Deep and Midnight Express .
In 1980 Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters by then a successful producer in his own right after the death of Mr. Bogart .
While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others their record was n't always so impressive .
Among their clinkers were The Legend of Billie Jean VisionQuest Clue and Clan of the Cave Bear .
And the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates .
The studio says it stuck with them even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner .
Mr. Guber replies that this is a Goliath this Time Warner trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters maintain that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse but that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony .
From the beginning they knew we had a goal and a dream says Mr. Guber .
On a number of occasions he adds he tried to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright .
They always listened but they never acted Mr. Guber says .
In 1987 Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a 28 % stake in Barris Entertainment a small-fry TV production company controlled by Giant Industries Inc. Chairman Burt Sugarman .
In July a year later Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs. Guber Peters and Sugarman made a 100 million offer to buy 25 % of MGM\/UA .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters planned to run the nearly dormant MGM studio and the two even tried to interest Warner Bros .
President Terry Semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal .
But the MGM plan collapsed just two weeks later .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price .
Their relationship with Mr. Sugarman soured shortly thereafter .
Last May he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co .
Meanwhile Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract .
The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind both financially and in terms of creative freedom .
But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month the chance at last to run a major studio about 50 million in deferred compensation up to 10 % of Columbia 's future cash flow 8 % of the future appreciation of Columbia 's market value and annual salaries of 2.7 million for each .
The producers ' 28 % share of publicly held Guber Peters would net them an additional 50 million .
Sony also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to Warner .
Sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only 42 million last year .
And earnings have been erratic .
In the the latest quarter thanks in part to Batman Guber Peters earned 5.8 million or 50 cents a share compared to a loss of 6.8 million or 62 cents a share in last year 's quarter .
Guber Peters stock which traded as low as 6 a share last year closed yesterday at 16.625 .
The two sides now are accusing each other of lying .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise .
But in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court Mr. Ross Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made .
Warner in its court filings calls it a piece of fiction created for this litigation .
Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different .
For one thing according to Mr. Daly the producers requested a release in advance .
Moreover the old contract was about to expire and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now .
Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights and it was in Warner 's interest to accommodate MGM\/UA Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives Mr. Daly said in his affidavit .
Warner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia .
At the very least Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony .
During settlement talks for example Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner according to executives involved in the talks .
In any settlement Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years notably sequels to Batman .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner .
And they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts .
The last time Columbia Pictures was looking for a studio chief they note Warner released producer David Puttnam from his contract then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at Columbia .
In his affidavit filed yesterday Warner 's Mr. Ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument If Sony succeeds here no written contract in Hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on .
THE SALES PITCH could n't sound better .
First there 's the name asset-backed securities .
Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing .
And there 's more .
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest and most secure institutions .
Most earn high ratings from credit agencies .
Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues .
And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors .
Ready to jump .
Well think twice .
The concept may be simple Take a bunch of loans tie them up in one neat package and sell pieces of the package to investors .
But the simplicity may be misleading .
Skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk .
They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them and those are hard to evaluate .
Moreover the securities were introduced only about 4 1\/2 years ago the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession .
A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters says Owen Carney director of the investment securities division of the U.S. comptroller of the currency .
We do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn .
Such concerns however have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products .
Since the spring of 1985 financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities .
They have sold issues backed by car loans boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans .
They have offered bundles of homeequity loans as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares .
Last year there
