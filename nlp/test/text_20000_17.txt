Harley-Davidson Inc. filed suit in federal court here alleging that a group that holds 6.2 % of its stock made false deceptive and misleading statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements .
Harley-Davidson 's complaint claims that the group led by investor Malcolm I. Glazer violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15 % of the company 's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filing eventually was made it did n't disclose the group 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law .
Mr. Glazer could n't immediately be reached to comment .
But when Harley last week publicly questioned the legality of the group 's filing procedures the Rochester N.Y. investor said we complied with every law and he denied any wrongdoing .
The Glazer group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in Harley-Davidson or seek representation on the company 's board .
Harley has said it does n't intend to be acquired by the Glazer group or any other party .
Inland Steel Industries Inc. battered by lower volume and higher costs posted a 75 % drop in third-quarter earnings .
The nation 's fourth-largest steelmaker earned 18.3 million or 43 cents a share compared with 61 million or 1.70 a share a year earlier when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing .
Sales fell to 981.2 million from 1.02 billion .
The earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter 's 45.3 million or 1.25 a share .
Moreover the earnings were well below analysts ' expectations of about 1.16 a share .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Inland closed yesterday at 35.875 a share down 1 .
The company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market especially in the automotive sector .
However the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter .
Third-quarter shipments slipped 7 % from the year-ago period and 17 % from this year 's second quarter .
Profit of steel shipped for the company 's steel segment slid to 26 a ton from 66 a ton a year earlier and 57 a ton a quarter earlier .
Analysts noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices for steel products .
Charles Bradford an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar hot-rolled and structural steel .
Structural steel which primarily serves the construction market was especially hurt by a 15 % price drop Mr. Bradford said .
The company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material repair and maintenance and labor costs .
The increased labor costs became effective Aug. 1 under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers union .
Meanwhile the company 's service center segment which saw operating profit drop to 11.5 million from 30.7 million a year ago experienced much of the same demand and cost problems as well as start-up costs associated with a coil processing facility in Chicago and an upgraded computer information system .
Inland Chairman Frank W. Luerssen said the company 's short-term outlook is clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets .
However he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter .
In the first nine months profit was 113 million or 3.04 a share on sales of 3.19 billion compared with 204.5 million or 5.76 a share on sales of 3.03 billion a year earlier .
The seismic activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth .
When things are quiet low volatility the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately .
However when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure the more earthquake-resistant it is the better its chance for survival .
America 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully aftershock-resistant .
Investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information .
That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity .
And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks .
In today 's markets specialists on the New York Stock Exchange and upstairs market makers in the over-the-counter market are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process .
When they halt trading all market liquidity is gone .
And when any component of the market cash futures or options loses liquidity the price discovery system the way prices are determined becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time .
Last Friday the 13th as well as two years ago this week the markets became unlinked .
When that happened seismic tremors of fear much like the shock waves created by an earthquake coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility .
Lack of important needed information can cause fear .
Fear is the father of panic .
Panic frequently results in irrational behavior .
And in financial markets irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe .
When market tremors start it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve buy and sell orders at various prices be made available to all not just to market makers .
Because of a lack of information and access many investors including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed because of their ignorance of important market information .
To add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets a modern electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena and the information that would automatically accompany such access by investors particularly institutional investors .
Contrary to some opinions the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole .
What market makers provide is immediacy a very valuable service .
Liquidity is not a service .
It is a market attribute the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news .
Market makers buy what investors wish to sell their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors and at a profit .
As a result while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker which is micro-liquidity for the investor the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction The unwanted position is still an unwanted position only the identity of the seller has changed .
In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers a result of some post-1987 crash studies also increases market volatility since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time the more selling pressure is overhanging the market .
In an open electronic system any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve buy and sell orders at each price entered by dealers and investors alike and to enter and execute orders .
Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis .
Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field Congress sought and called a national market system not yet achieved almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975 .
Last Friday 's market gyrations did not result in severe aftershocks .
Were we smart or just lucky .
I 'm not certain .
But I am sure we need to maximize our earthquake protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock-damping power to our nation 's markets .

NOW YOU SEE IT now you do n't .
The recession that is .
The economy 's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up .
So often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane .
For the past seven years investors have had the wind at their backs in the form of a generally growing economy .
Some may have forgotten and some younger ones may never have experienced what it 's like to invest during a recession .
Different tactics are called for as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher .
For those investors who believe or fear that 1990 will be a recession year many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio .
In a nutshell pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in defensive industries .
A heavy dose of cash is prescribed along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds preferably government bonds .
It 's tempting to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand .
But that may not be possible because recessions often take investors by surprise .
They always seem to come a bit later than you expect .
When they do hit they hit fast says David A. Wyss chief financial economist at the Data Resources division of McGraw-Hill Inc .
Though he himself does n't expect a recession soon Mr. Wyss advises people who do that the best thing to be in is long that is 20-year to 30-year Treasury bonds .
The reason is simple Mr. Wyss says Interest rates almost always decline during recession .
As surely as a seesaw tilts falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds .
They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do .
That effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds .
But short-term bonds ca n't rise too much because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon .
Long-term bonds with many years left before maturity swing more widely in price .
But not just any bonds will do .
Corporate bonds are usually not a good bet in a recession Mr. Wyss says .
As times get tougher investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts .
This hurts the price of corporate bonds .
Also he notes most corporate bonds are callable .
That means that a corporation after a specified amount of time has passed can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value plus in some cases a sweetener .
When interest rates have dropped it makes sense for corporations to do just that they then save on interest costs .
But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny .
If corporate bonds are bad in recessions junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all .
It 's an absolute necessity to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing says Avner Arbel professor of finance at Cornell University .
Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside and this could be a disaster .
Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government .
During an economic slump local tax revenues often go down raising the risks associated with at least some municipals .
And like corporates many municipal bonds are callable .
But a few experts going against the consensus do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing .
One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co. a brokerage house in Houston who thinks that we 're either in a recession or about to go into one .
What 's more he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual Once the downturn comes it 's going to be very hard to reverse .
Investors he advises should be cautious holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds .
Because he sees a 5 % to 6 % base rate of inflation in the economy he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon .
Instead Mr. Beach says investors probably should be carrying a very high level of cash by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills .
Greg Confair president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown Pa. also recommends that investors go heavily for cash .
He is n't sure a recession is coming but says the other likely alternative reignited inflation is just as bad .
This late in an expansion the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession Mr. Confair says .
The Federal Reserve Board 's plan for a soft landing he says requires the Fed to navigate an ever-narrowing corridor .
A soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all Mr. Confair adds .
It has to be engineered over and over again month after month .
He believes that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw .
And in a sense that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios .
It comes down to a question of whether to try to time the market .
For people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad stocks have been rewarding long-term investments .
Most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9 % to 10 % including both dividends and price appreciation .
That 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid .
Moreover because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing .
Trying to time the economy is a mistake says David Katz chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York .
Mr. Katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years .
Investors who listened and lightened up on stocks have just hurt themselves he says .
Mr. Katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70 % of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy .
Frequent trading runs up high commission costs .
And the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time .
Still few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming .
After all in all five recessions since 1960 stocks declined .
According to Ned Davis president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis Fla. the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21 % and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started .
By the time a recession is official two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product much of the damage to stocks has already been done and in the typical case the recession is already half over .
About six months before a recession ends stocks typically begin to rise again as investors anticipate a recovery .
The average recession lasts about a year .
Unfortunately though recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't reliably be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases .
But whatever their advice about timing none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession .
For the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks professionals have a number of suggestions .
Mr. Katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios that is low prices in relation to the company 's earnings per share .
Low P-E stocks he says vastly outperform others during a recession or bear market .
In good times he says they lag a bit but overall they provide superior performance .
Prof. Arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small companies .
Small-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession he says .
And in any case he argues stocks of small companies are almost as overpriced as they were Sept. 30 1987 just before the crash .
For example Mr. Arbel says stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow .
Cash flow basically earnings plus depreciation is one common gauge of a company 's financial health .
That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash Mr. Arbel says .
And it 's way above the ratio 7.5 times cash flow that bigger companies are selling for .
Another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in defensive industries .
Food tobacco drugs and utilities are the classic examples .
Recession or not people still eat smoke and take medicine when they 're sick .

Mr. Dorfman covers investing issues from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau .
Some industry groups consistently weather the storm better than others .
The following shows the number of times these industries outperformed the Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index during the first six months of the past seven recessions .
Bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt .
But while the overall market improved the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count casualties even as junk-bond prices rose .
Yesterday Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it postponed a 220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by York International Corp .
And Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a 475 million debenture offering by Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. that was still being negotiated late last night .
The issue by Chicago & North Western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar .
Some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk .
Since last week 's junk-bond market debacle many new issues of high-yield high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back delayed or dropped .
On Wednesday Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines ' junk-bond offering to 71 million from 150 million .
Salomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co. 's 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction .
Last week the Grand Union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock .
