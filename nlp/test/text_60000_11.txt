After slipping on news of a smaller-than-expected U.S. inflation figure the dollar rebounded later in the trading day .
The U.S. unit dipped to a session low against the mark just after the release of the U.S. consumer price index .
The report showed that September consumer prices rose just 0.2 % a smaller increase than expected .
The market had anticipated a 0.4 % rise in the price index .
The September index fueled speculation damaging to the dollar that the Federal Reserve soon will ease monetary policy further .
But foreign-exchange dealers said the dollar staged a quick comeback prompted by a round of short covering and some fresh buying interest later in the trading day .
Traders said that a nearly 40-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average fueled in part by news of a lower-than-expected price index had little influence on the dollar 's moves .

In Tokyo Friday the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.93 yen up from Thursday 's Tokyo close of 141.55 yen .
Some analysts said the consumer price index reflects a more significant slowdown in the U.S. economy than earlier indicated .
They point out that September 's producer-price index showed a 0.9 % increase .
They noted that because the consumer price index known as the CPI is a more comprehensive measure of inflation and is rising less rapidly than the producer-price index or PPI it could signal further easing by Fed .
Others suggested however that the Fed will hold any changes in monetary policy in check leaving fed funds at around 8 3\/4 % down from the 9 % level that prevailed from July through September .
Kevin Logan chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corp. said that both PPI and CPI climbed around 4 1\/2 % year-to-year in September .
He argued that both CPI and PPI have in fact decelerated since spring .
The Fed wo n't be stampeded into easing Mr. Logan said predicting that for now interest rates will stay where they are .

Hotel Investors Trust and its affiliate Hotel Investors Corp. said the companies plan to sell all of the hotels the companies own and operate except for two hotel-casinos in Las Vegas Nev .
The hotels and management interests will be sold at an auction said John Rothman president and chief executive officer of the trust and a director of the corporation .
Value of the properties and management interests was n't disclosed .
In all the Los Angeles-based trust plans to sell its interests in 36 hotels while the corporation will sell its management interests in 32 of those properties .
Excluded from the sale are the interests of the trust and the corporation in two Las Vegas hotel-casinos .
After completing the sale and paying debts the trust and corporation will consider a number of options including a stock repurchase payment of special dividend or investment in more gaming properties .
The companies will retain their current regular quarterly dividend of 25 cents during the sale process Mr. Rothman said .
For the first six months the trust and corporation had a net loss of 244,000 .

For the nine-month period Baxter said net rose 15 % to 307 million or 1.02 a share from 267 million or 89 cents a share during the year-ago period .
Sales for the nine months were up 8 % to 5.44 billion from 5.04 billion in the same period in 1988 .

Earlier this month IMA said it had received about 1 billion of senior debt financing from Chemical Bank and six other banks Chemical Bank said it was highly confident it could arrange the balance of about 509 million .
In addition the 3 billion bid includes 1 billion of debt that will be assumed by IMA 600 million of high-yield junk bonds that will be sold by First Boston Corp. and 285 million of equity .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday American Medical closed at 23.625 up 1.875 .

American Medical said it would pursue the inquiries from the companies but would n't identify them unless they make firm offers .
H&R Block is one of the great success stories of U.S. business .
Oddly enough this presents a problem for the stock .
Some money managers are disenchanted with H&R Block because they suspect the company 's glory days are past or at least passing .
Block 's tax-preparation business is mature they say and some of its diversifications are facing tough competition .
It 's no secret that Block dominates the mass-market tax-preparation business .
The Street knows all about the predictability of its earnings which are headed for a ninth consecutive yearly increase .
The company has consistently earned more than a 20 % annual return on its net worth while many companies would be happy with 15 % .
But the tax-preparation business simply has no more room to grow says Mark Cremonie director of research for Capital Supervisors Inc. a Chicago firm that manages 6.5 billion .
You go to any medium-sized town in the U.S. and you 're going to see H&R Block tax services .
Mr. Cremonie 's firm once held about 4.8 % of H&R Block .
That was before the 1986 tax reform made taxes more complex than ever .
One thing you can bet on he says is that Congress will do stupid things with the Tax Code .
But Capital Supervisors sold the last of its H&R Block holdings earlier this year .
They 're thrashing around for diversification he says .
I think a lot of their businesses are just so-so .
Last week the stock hit an all-time high of 37 1\/4 before getting roughed up in the Friday-the-13th minicrash .
It closed yesterday at 34 3\/4 .
To be sure the stock still has a lot of fans .
If you invested 10,000 in the initial public offering in 1962 it would be worth well over 5 million today says Fredric E. Russell a Tulsa Okla. money manager .
I do n't know what the risk is of holding the stock .
Taxes are not going out of business .
Many of his peers feel the same way .
The number of big institutions that own H&R Block shares is 207 and growing according to a midyear tally by CDA Investment Technologies .
Brokerage houses are sweet on H&R Block too .
Zacks Investment Research counts five brokerage houses that consider the stock a buy and four that call it a hold .
None dare say to sell it .
But some money managers are doing just that .
Eugene Sit president of Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis says When we bought it we thought the growth rate was going to accelerate because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer which waits for Uncle Sam 's check .
But neither of those developments did much to juice up growth Mr. Sit says .
He figures Block earnings are now growing at about a 10 % annual rate down from about 14 % the past five years and will grow at an 8%-10 % rate in the future .
That 's not bad Mr. Sit says but it sure does n't justify Block shares being priced at 15 to 16 times estimated earnings for fiscal 1990 .
He wants stocks whose price\/earnings ratio is less than their growth rate as he figures it H&R Block does n't even come close .
Two other money managers in explaining why they have sold large amounts of H&R Block stock this year spoke on the condition they not be named .
The stock was going no place and the earnings were so-so said one .
In the past two years the stock almost stalled out .
It was above 33 adjusted for a subsequent split in 1987 and has n't gotten much higher since .
There 's no more growth in the tax business except for increasing prices the money manager added .
The CompuServe subsidiary which provides information to home-computer users is where the growth is he said but its format is still too complicated .
CompuServe provides about 20 % of both sales and earnings .
The tax business still provides about 70 % of earnings on about 50 % of sales .
Personnel Pool temporary workers mostly in the health-care area chips in close to 25 % of sales but only about 9 % of earnings .
The shortage of nurses is crimping profit at Personnel Pool said the second money manager .
He concedes H&R Block is well-entrenched and a great company but says it does n't grow fast enough for us .
We 're looking for something that grows faster and sells at a comparable price-earnings multiple .
Thomas M. Bloch president and chief operating officer says I would disagree that the tax business is mature .
For example he says the company is planning to go nationwide with a new service tested in parts of the country aimed at taxpayers who want refunds in a hurry .
Mr. Bloch concedes that a recent diversification attempt fell through .
We 're still interested in diversifying he says but we 'd rather be prudent than make a mistake .
He also says CompuServe 's earnings continue to grow 20 % to 30 % a year in spite of tough competition from giants like Sears and IBM .
And he says Block 's other businesses are growing although less consistently .
H&R Block NYSE Symbol:HRB Business Tax Preparation Year ended April 30 1989 Revenue 899.6 million Net loss 100.2 million 1.90 a share First quarter July 31 1989 Per-share earnings Loss of 8 cents vs. loss of 9 cents Average daily trading volume 145,954 shares Philips Industries Inc. said its board authorized the redemption Dec. 6 of the company 's 1 cumulative convertible special preferred stock at 37.50 a share not including a 25 cent dividend for the current quarter and the 3 cumulative convertible preferred stock at 75 plus a 75 cent dividend for the current quarter .
The Dayton Ohio maker of parts for the building and transportation industries said holders of the two issues can convert their stock into common shares through the close of business Dec. 1 .
Each 1 cumulative share can be converted into 4.92 common shares the ratio on the 3 cumulative is eight common shares for each 3 cumulative preferred .
Philips did n't indicate how many shares outstanding it has of either issue .
Company officials could n't be reached .
Earlier this month the company said its board approved a proposed management-led leveraged buy-out at 25.50 a share or 750 million .
During its centennial year The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history .
PUTS AND CALLS STOCK MARKET PATOIS for options to sell or buy a company 's shares were long an arcane Wall Street art best left to the experts who used them either as a hedge or for pure speculation .
Options lost some of their mystery in 1973 when the Chicago Board of Trade set up a special exchange to deal in them .
Until then options had been traded only in the over-the-counter market mostly in New York and in an almost invisible secondary market operating chiefly by telephone .
The Chicago Board of Trade the No. 1 U.S. grain market had long chafed under the attention won by its innovative archrival the livestock-dealing Mercantile Exchange .
So the men who ran the grain pits listened when Joseph Sullivan a 35-year-old former Wall Street Journal newsman offered them the idea of all-options trading .
After four year of tinkering and 2.4 million in seed money the board set up the new marketplace titled it the Chicago Board Options Exchange and named Sullivan its first president .
The beginnings were modest .
The CBOE opened for business on April 26 1973 in what had been a Board of Trade lunchroom .
It listed just 16 options to buy a pilot list of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange .
Puts or sell options would not be added until 1977 .
The 282 members had paid 10,000 apiece for seats .
The 1989 price 250,000 .
The first day 's business was 911 contracts each for 100 shares of one of the listed stocks .
By the end of 1973 the number of underlying Big Board stocks had been increased to 50 and the options exchange had run up volume of 1.1 million contracts .
A year later it was 5.7 million .
Last year more than 1,800 traders on the CBOE bought and sold 112 million contracts on 178 listed stocks 60 % of all U.S. listed options trading .
The new exchange drew instant recognition from an unwelcome quarter .
The government campaigning against fixed brokerage commissions promptly sued the CBOE over its minimum-fee system .
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled unanimously that the financial troubles facing the Seabrook N.H. nuclear-power plant have no impact on whether the plant receives a full-power license .
Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon opposing the license said he will appeal the ruling in federal court .
Seabrook officials said the plant could receive a full-power license by the end of the year .
The NRC rejected Mr. Shannon 's argument that Public Service Co. of New Hampshire which owns the largest share of Seabrook and 11 other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plant 's safe operation .
Mr. Shannon was seeking a waiver of NRC policy that ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions .
In its ruling the NRC said that because Seabrook will be allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make payments on past construction costs consideration of the owners ' financial condition is pointless .
The commissioners found the circumstances of the case did n't undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available funds adequate for safe operation said a commission spokesman .
In January 1988 the utility filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code allowing it to continue to operate while protected from creditors ' lawsuits .
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. New York the newly merged drug and health-care-product company reported record third-quarter earnings for both companies in the merger .
Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp. Princeton N.J. merged Oct. 4 but the new company reported third-period earnings for both companies .
For the fourth quarter Bristol-Myers Squibb will report one set of earnings .
Bristol-Myers said net income rose 15 % to 266.2 million or 93 cents a share from 232.3 million or 81 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales gained 5 % to 1.59 billion from 1.52 billion .
Squibb Corp. said net rose 17 % to 144.5 million or 1.47 a share from 123 million or 1.25 a share .
Sales were 730.1 million up 7 % from 679.5 million .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 1.75 to 52.75 .
PPG Industries Inc. hurt by softness in the U.S. automotive and construction industries said third-quarter net income fell 5.5 % to 106.7 million or 97 cents a share from 112.9 million or 1.03 a share a year ago .
Sales were nearly identical to the year-earlier 1.36 billion .
The drop in earnings did n't surprise analysts who said the Pittsburgh glass coatings and chemical concern had been predicting a slow quarter because of the sluggish construction industry a major market for the company 's flat glass .
Glass sales to Canadian and European auto makers and sales of replacement auto glass in all markets increased .
The coating segment also posted higher sales particularly in North America and Europe .
But sale increases were offset by slumping sales in flat glass and fiberglass reinforcements the company said .
Also chemicals sales were slightly down because of lower prices for vinyl chloride monomer and other chlorine derivatives .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading PPG closed at 41 a share down 37.5 cents .
Jefferies Group Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 4 % to 2.2 million or 35 cents a share from 2.3 million or 31 cents a share on more shares a year earlier .
Revenue rose 15 % to 36 million from 31.2 million .
Jefferies a Los Angeles holding company primarily engaged in securities trading also said stock market declines since the quarter ended Sept. 30 created an unrealized pretax loss of about 6 million in its risk arbitrage account .
For the nine months Jefferies said net fell 39 % to 6.8 million or 1.07 a share from 11.1 million or 1.50 a share .
Revenue fell 3 % to 105.2 million from 108.4 million .
Sony Corp. New York said its bids for Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. have been cleared by federal antitrust regulators .
The Japanese company said the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act for the 3.4 billion bid for Columbia and the 200 million offer for Guber-Peters expired Monday .
Sony has agreed to buy both companies but is in a legal battle with Warner Communications Inc. over the services of producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters .
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Sony also said two more suits have been filed opposing the company 's agreement to buy Columbia .
Sony added that a hearing has been set for Thursday in the Delaware Chancery Court in one of the suits .

China said the question of Taiwan 's membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be considered only after China 's own membership in the 97-nation organization is restored .
Both China and Taiwan are seeking seats in GATT which sponsors trade-liberalizing agreements and sets world-commerce rules .
As one of China 's provinces Taiwan has no right to join GATT on its own Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said .
China under the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek was a founding member of GATT in 1947 .
The Nationalists withdrew in 1950 after their flight to Taiwan and the Communist government in Beijing applied for restoration of China 's membership in July 1986 .
The U.S. has voiced opposition to China 's bid for GATT membership saying China has yet to undertake needed economic reforms .

Japan says its economic growth will fall sharply if it cuts back on the use of oil coal and gas to cap emissions of carbon dioxide .
A Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said that a study found that Japan 's annual economic growth rate would eventually be only 0.8 % if carbon-dioxide emissions remained at this year 's level of 300 million tons .
The study will support arguments against capping carbon-dioxide emissions that Japan will make at a U.N.-backed conference on atmospheric pollution next month .
The study said Japan 's carbon-dioxide emissions would slightly more than double by 2010 unless the nation reduced its dependence on fossil fuels .
It said that expanding nuclear-power capability is the quickest way to lessen that dependence .
But increased reliance on nuclear power would meet stiff opposition from environmentalists a second ministry official said .

Slowing sales of its profitable Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles are forcing Chrysler Corp. to temporarily idle its Toledo Ohio assembly plant for the first time since April 1986 .
About 5,500 hourly workers will be laid off for a week beginning Oct. 23 and overtime has been eliminated at the plant for the fourth quarter a Chrysler spokesman said .
That 's a significant change from earlier this year when the plant worked substantial overtime only to have sales fall short of the company 's bullish expectations .
Sales of Cherokee the best-selling Jeep and the lower-volume Wagoneer were actually up about 10 % through the end of last month .
But that 's less than Chrysler officials had hoped when they set ambitious production schedules for the Toledo plant earlier this year .
Even when it became clear this spring that demand was n't coming up to expectations Chrysler officials resisted cutting output because Cherokee and Wagoneer are very profitable vehicles the spokesman said .
Instead Chrysler officials in late May slapped 1,000 cash rebates on the vehicles including the first such incentives on the popular four-door Cherokee since Chrysler bought Jeep in 1987 .
The incentives boosted sales for a while but the pace had cooled by last month .
The result Chrysler dealers had a bloated 82-day supply of the Cherokee as of the end of last month and a 161-day supply of the Comanche pickup which Toledo also builds .
A 60-day to 65-day supply is considered normal .
At Jasper Jeep-Eagle one of the largest Jeep dealerships in the country inventories have continued to swell .
Steve Lowe general manager of Jasper Ga. dealership said new rebates of 500 to 1,000 on the models have stimulated sales but not enough to significantly cut dealer stocks .
If people are n't buying you have to close plants he said .
Separately Chrysler said it will idle for four weeks the St. Louis assembly plant that builds the Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models .
Chrysler officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on Nov. 20. and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected .
General Motors Corp. meanwhile said it will idle for yet another week its Linden N.J. assembly plant bringing to three weeks the total time that plant will be idled during October .
GM said the assembly plant which builds the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30 .
The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars .
Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM to offer 800 rebates on those cars .
The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet but sales of the cars are off 9.6 % for the year and fell a steep 34.2 % early this month .
GM has scheduled overtime at its Lordstown Ohio and Janesville Wis. assembly plants which build the Chevrolet Cavalier .
Ford Motor Co. said it will shut down for one week its Kentucky Truck Plant because of a shortage of dealer orders .
The shutdown will idle 2,000 hourly employees and eliminate production of about 1,300 medium and heavy duty trucks .
The assembly plant is scheduled to resume production on Oct. 30 .
Meanwhile the nine major U.S. auto makers plan to build 143,178 cars this week down 11.7 % from 162,190 a year ago and flat with last week 's 142,117 car output .

LOTUS DEVELOPMENT Corp. 's net income rose 61 % in the third quarter from the year-earlier period .
Yesterday 's edition misstated the percentage increase .
First Fidelity Bancorp. Lawrenceville N.J. reported a 24 % drop in third-quarter profit because of a decline in earning assets lower loan volume and tighter interest margins .
The bank holding company posted net income of 54.4 million or 87 cents a share including 1.7 million or three cents a share in one-time tax benefits .
A year earlier net was 71.6 million or 1.22 a share .
First Fidelity said non-performing assets increased to 482.3 million Sept. 30 from 393.1 million June 30 .
The rise resulted from the transfer to non-accrual status of 96 million owed by two national borrowers and one local commercial real-estate customer First Fidelity said .
It said it does n't anticipate any loss of principal on two of the loans comprising 85 million of these credits .
First Fidelity said it boosted its loan-loss provision to 50.9 million from 20.4 million a year ago primarily because of a weaker real-estate sector in the region .
VIACOM Inc. 's loss narrowed to 21.7 million in the third quarter from 56.9 million a year ago .
Thursday 's edition misstated the narrowing .
Coastal Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement with Aruba to restart a 150,000-barrel-a-day oil refinery .
Coastal would n't disclose the terms .
Coastal a Houston oil and gas company said it expects to begin operations in October 1990 .
The company said it may install additional processing units at the refinery to produce higher octane gasolines and other products .
The company said it was leasing the site of the refinery from Aruba .
Exxon Corp. built the plant but closed it in 1985 and sold off much of the equipment to dismantling contractors from whom Coastal bought back much of the equipment .
A Coastal spokesman said the biggest expense will be to refurbish the refinery but would n't say how much that would be .
The prime minister of Aruba has said it could cost around 100 million .
Coastal said the refinery 's expected daily production will include 34,000 barrels of jet fuel 32,000 barrels of low-sulfur diesel fuel 30,000 barrels of naphtha 17,000 barrels of residual fuel oil 8,000 barrels of asphalt and 25,000 barrels of low-sulfur catalytic cracker feedstock .
Loral Corp. said fiscal second-quarter net income was 19.8 million or 79 cents a share compared with year-earlier earnings from continuing operations of 15.6 million or 62 cents a share .
Year-earlier net of 21 million or 84 cents a share included the results of Loral 's former Aircraft Braking Systems and Engineered Fabrics divisions which were sold April 27 to the company 's chairman Bernard L. Schwartz .
The defense electronics concern attributed the operating improvement to higher profit margins and lower net interest expense .
Loral also reported that its bookings more than doubled to 654 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from 257 million in the year-before period .
The increase was due mainly to a 325 million order from Turkey to equip its fleet of F-16 fighters with Loral 's ALQ-178 Rapport III electronic countermeasures system .
The order is the biggest in the company 's history .
Sales in the latest period edged up to 295.7 million from 293.9 million .
Mr. Schwartz said the recent increase in orders puts us well on the way to our goal of 1.6 billion in bookings for the year .
He added I expect to see the earnings momentum we experienced this quarter continue for the rest of the year .
Loral said it expects sales to accelerate in both the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year .
Loral 's profit from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal 1990 was 36.4 million or 1.44 a share up 31 % from 27.8 million or 1.11 a share a year earlier .
Net income fell 8.6 % to 37.1 million or 1.43 a share from 40.6 million or 1.56 a share .
Fiscal first-half sales slipped 3.9 % to 528.4 million from 549.9 million .
Bookings for the first half totaled 813 million compared with the 432 million recorded last year .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Loral closed at 33.25 down 37.5 cents .
HealthVest said two of its lenders have given it notices of default on bank loans and said they may take actions to recover their loans .
HealthVest an Austin Texas real estate investment trust said that Chemical Bank the lead bank under its domestic bank agreement told it that if 3.3 million owed to the bank group is n't paid by today the group will call the 120 million that HealthVest has outstanding under the credit line .
The bank group also said that it wo n't make additional advances under the 150 million credit line .
HealthVest missed a payment to the group that was due in late September .
In addition HealthVest said Bank of Tokyo Trust Co. also has notified it of a default and said it might take action to cure the default .
HealthVest missed an interest payment to Bank of Tokyo on Oct. 1 .
However HealthVest said the Tokyo bank indicated that it wo n't accelerate HealthVest 's 50 million loan .
HealthVest is in a severe liquidity bind because its affiliate Healthcare International Inc. has failed to make about 10.6 million in principal and interest payments owed since August .
Healthcare operates many of the health-care properties that HealthVest owns .
EMPIRE PENCIL later called Empire-Berol developed the plastic pencil in 1973 .
Yesterday 's Centennial Journal misstated the company 's name .
Storage Technology Corp. had net income of 8.3 million or 32 cents a share for its fiscal-third quarter ended Sept. 29 almost 15 times the 557,000 or two cents a share it posted for the year-ago period .
Storage Louisville Colo. which makes data-storage devices for mainframe computers said the huge increase in net reflects strong sales of its tape products particularly the 4400 Automated Cartridge System which holds a library of tape cartridges .
The company said it recently sold its 750th cartridge system which cost 400,000 to 500,000 each .
Quarter revenue was 232.6 million up 12 % from 206 million last year .
The stock market reacted strongly to the news .
Storage rose 1.125 a share to close at 14 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
For the nine months Storage had net of 25.5 million or 98 cents a share including an 11.3 million extraordinary gain for the anticipated proceeds from liquidating an Irish unit .
Net was up 69 % from 15.1 million or 57 cents a share last year .
Revenue for the latest period was up 11 % to 682.7 million from 614.6 million .
A Canadian government agency conditionally approved proposed exports to the U.S. of natural gas from big untapped fields in the Mackenzie River delta area of the western Canadian Arctic .
Three companies Esso Resources Canada Ltd. Shell Canada Ltd. and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. applied to the Canadian National Energy Board to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta natural gas over 20 years starting in 1996 .
To be economically feasible the 11 billion Canadian dollar 9.37 billion project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices .
It also faces numerous other hurdles including an agreement on a pipeline route for the gas .
The board said the export licenses would be issued on the condition that Canadian interests would also be allowed to bid for the Mackenzie delta gas on terms similar to those offered to U.S. customers .
U.S. buyers have already been lined up .
They include Enron Corp. Texas Eastern Corp. Pacific Interstate Transmission Co. and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co .
The project could result in the U.S. taking more than 10 % of its natural gas supplies from Canada up from about 5 % currently .
It would bring 13 gas fields into production at a combined rate of about 1.2 billion cubic feet a day .
The board estimated that the cost of building a pipeline from the Mackenzie delta to Alberta would be about 5.9 million .
It also said projections of surging U.S. demand for natural gas and price forecasts of 5.25 per thousand cubic feet by 2005 would make the project economically viable .
Esso a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd. which is 71%-owned by Exxon Corp. will be allowed to export 5.1 trillion cubic feet to the U.S. in the 20-year period .
Shell a subsidiary of Royal Dutch\/Shell Group will be allowed to export 0.9 trillion cubic feet and Gulf a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. will be allowed to export 3.2 trillion cubic feet .
Combustion Engineering Inc. Stamford Conn. said it sold and agreed to sell several investments and nonstrategic businesses for about 100 million which will be used for reducing debt and general purposes .
The transactions are unrelated .
The company agreed to sell its minority investments in makers of steam-generating and related equipment Stein Industrie and Energie & Verfahrenstechnik to the major shareholder in the companies Dutch-based GEC Alsthom N.V .
Combustion Engineering which provides engineered products systems and services for power generation also sold Illinois Minerals Co. based in Cairo Ill .
That unit of its Georgia Kaolin Co. subsidiary was sold to a unit of Unimin Corp .
Assets of Construction Equipment International Houston were sold to Essex Crane Inc. and the assets of Elgin Electronics Erie Pa. were sold to closely held Charter Technologies Inc .
Where do Americans put their money .
It depends on when you look .
In 1900 for instance less than 8 % of assets went into bank deposits .
That rose to nearly 18 % during the Depression and has n't changed much since .
Pension reserves on the other hand made up a relatively small part of household assets until the last decade when they skyrocketed .
And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms .
That 's some of what emerges from the following charts which show how Americans have changed their investment patterns over the past 90 years .
Some results are self-explanatory .
But other figures are surprising .
Housing for instance has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade although common wisdom would have expected an increase .
There is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth says Edward N. Wolff professor of economics at New York University .
But it has n't increased much relative to other assets .
It suggests that households accumulate wealth across a broad spectrum of assets .
And housing though it appears in the popular mind as being the major growing household asset is n't .
In addition investors ' desire to hold stocks directly and through mutual funds has held surprisingly steady stocks ' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market and not a shift in stock-holding preferences .
Stocks have not spread to the general public despite the fact that the environment is much different concludes Robert Avery an economist at Cornell University .
To me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets we have ways of holding wealth similar to 100 years ago .
The charts show how househld assets have been distributed over time .

McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it sent a letter to LIN Broadcasting Corp. clarifying its revised tender offer for LIN and asking LIN to conduct a fair auction .
The letter apparently came in response to a request for clarification by LIN earlier this week .
LIN which has agreed with BellSouth Corp. to merge their cellular-telephone businesses said then that it would n't take a position on McCaw 's revised tender offer .
Earlier this month McCaw revised its offer to 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares .
McCaw is seeking 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern the revised offer includes a feature requiring McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN .
The letter outlines broad powers for an independent group of directors provided for in the revised offer .
In a statement Craig O. McCaw chairman and chief executive officer of McCaw said We trust LIN will take no further actions that favor BellSouth .
McCaw said the three independent directors provided for in the offer would be designated by the current board .
The successors would be nominated by the independent directors .
LIN would have a priority right to pursue all opportunities to acquire U.S. cellular interests in markets other than those in which McCaw holds an interest or which are contiguous to those markets unless LIN has an interest there or contiguous to it .
Independent directors would have veto rights to any acquisition if they unanimously decide it is n't in LIN 's best interest .
Independent directors would be able to block transactions they unanimously deem would be likely to depress the private market value of LIN at the time it is to be sold in five years .
If LIN is put up for sale rather than purchased by McCaw in five years McCaw wo n't submit a bid unless the independent directors request it and the independent directors will run the bidding .
The directors would be able to sell particular assets to enable such buyers as the regional Bell operating companies to purchase the company 's interests .
MCA Inc. said third-quarter net fell 6.3 % to 50.8 million or 69 cents a share from 54.3 million or 74 cents a share a year earlier .
MCA said revenue rose 14 % to 918.4 million from 806.7 million .
The entertainment concern said the success of several movies released during the quarter including Parenthood and Uncle Buck contributed to record revenue for its film unit .
Both MCA 's music-entertainment and book-publishing units also posted record revenue and operating profit .
The parent company 's net included a loss which it did n't specify that was related to the company 's 50 % stake in Cineplex Odeon Corp .
Cineplex a Toronto theater chain had a second-quarter net loss of 38.7 million .
MCA said net also included certain reserves related to the restructuring of its LJN Toys ' international operations .
These items were partly offset MCA said by an unspecified gain on the sale of its Miller International unit a maker and distributor of budget-priced audio cassettes .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading MCA rose 1.50 to 64 .
In the nine months net rose 35 % to 120.1 million or 1.64 a share from 89.2 million or 1.22 a share a year earlier .
Revenue increased 22 % to 2.5 billion from 2.1 billion .

Helmsley Enterprises Inc. plans to close its company-owned insurance business and is seeking other brokers to take over its policies according to individuals familiar with the New York firm .
Helmsley Enterprises is the umbrella organization for companies controlled by Harry B. Helmsley .
These include office and residential real estate giant HelmsleySpear Inc. and Helmsley Hotels .
The insurance brokerage agency just a fragment of Helmsley 's vast empire would be the first piece of the company to be stripped away since last summer when Mr. Helmsley 's wife Leona Helmsley was found guilty of tax evasion .
Industry sources estimate the agency brokers property and casualty premiums worth about 25 million annually and has revenue based on a standard 10 % commission rate of about 2.5 million .
The insurance firm acts as a broker on policies covering buildings managed by HelmsleySpear and others .
Many of the properties are owned through limited partnerships controlled by Mr. Helmsley .
New York State law prohibits insurance brokerages from deriving more than 10 % of revenue from insuring affiliated companies .
Helmsley 's insurance division had slightly exceeded that percentage sources say but the division was n't considered significant enough to the company to be restructured particularly at a difficult time for the firm .
Adverse publicity from the scandal surrounding its founder 's wife and related management strife have put pressure on the entire Helmsley organization .
However individuals close to the company insist shuttering the insurance division a sideline from the company 's core property management business is n't the beginning of a sale of assets .
Helmsley 's insurance premiums are expected to be transferred to several different insurance brokerage companies .
Frank B. Hall Inc. of Briarcliff Manor N.Y. is reportedly working out an agreement with Helmsley .
Officials there declined to comment as did Helmsley management .
