ple will be able to get there .
Like just about everything else that remains to be seen .
Aftershocks could intervene .
But at least the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side .
It may seem trivial to worry about the World Series amid the destruction to the Bay Area wrought by Tuesday 's quake but the name of this column is On Sports so I feel obliged to do so .
You might be interested to know that baseball not survival appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of 60,000-odd that had gathered at Candlestick at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday a half-hour before game time when the quake struck .
As soon as the tremor passed many people spontaneously arose and cheered as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show .
One fan seated several rows in front of the open upper-deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted We arranged that just for you guys .
I thought and I 'm sure others did You should n't have bothered .
I 'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster a tornado 15 or so summers ago near Traverse City Mich. so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things the urge to talk about them .
Perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into people 's faces and asking how they feel about one calamity or another fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat .
It felt like I was on a station platform and a train went by said one man describing my own reaction .
A women said she saw the park 's light standards sway .
A man said he saw the upper rim undulate .
I saw neither .
Dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding the general inclination was to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played .
I was near the top of the stadium and saw a steel girder bow six feet from where I sat but I stayed put for 10 or 15 minutes confessed a friend .
I guess I thought This is the World Series and I 'm not gon na wimp out .
Here in the Global Village though folks do not stay uninformed for long .
Electrical power was out in still-daylighted Candlestick Park but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful .
Within a few minutes the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear .
Its Richter Scale measurement was reported as 6.5 then 6.9 then 7.0 .
A section of the Bay Bridge had collapsed as had a part of Interstate Highway 880 in Oakland .
People had died .
At 5:40 p.m. scheduled game time having passed some fans chanted Let 's Play Ball .
No longer innocent they qualified as fools .
The stadium was ordered evacuated soon afterward the announcement made over police bullhorns cited the power outage but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend .
Outside I spotted two young men lugging blocks of concrete .
Pieces of Candlestick they said .
The crowd remained good natured even bemused .
TV reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while a few feet away others watched the interviews on their portable TVs .
The only frenzy I saw was commercial Booths selling World Series commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged by fledgling speculators who saw future profit in the items .
The traffic jam out of the park was monumental .
It took me a half-hour to move 10 feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle and an additional hour to reach an inner roadway a half-block away .
The six-mile trip to my airport hotel that had taken 20 minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours .
At my hotel the Westin power was out some interior plaster had broken loose and there had been water damage but little else .
With Garpian randomness a hotel across the street the Amfac had been hit harder A large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away .
The Westin staff had kindly set out lighted candles in the ballroom prepared a cold-cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets .
I fell asleep on the lobby floor next to a man wearing a Chicago Cubs jacket .
I expected him to say I told you so but he already was snoring .
The journalistic consensus was that the earthquake made the World Series seem unimportant .
My response was that sports rarely are important only diverting and the quake merely highlighted that fact .
Should the rest of the Series be played at all .
Sure .
The quake and baseball were n't related unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the 1972 Olympics .
That heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience and seems doomed to repeat it .
Two ironies intrude .
This has been widely dubbed the BART Series after the local subway line and the Bay Bridge Series .
Flags fly at half-staff for the death of Bart Giamatti the late baseball commissioner and now the Bay Bridge lies in ruins .
A Series that was shaping up as the dullest since the one-sided Detroit-over-San Diego go of 1984 has become memorable in the least fortunate way .
Still its edge is lost .
It now will be played mostly for the record and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible without off days .
And I will never again complain about a rainout .
The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers .
But two big New York banks seem to have kicked those chances away for the moment with the embarrassing failure of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. to deliver 7.2 billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp .
For more than a decade banks have been pressing Congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing Wall Street 's lucrative takeover game from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds .
Those expanded powers reached their zenith in July when Bankers Trust New York Corp. provided mergers advice an equity investment and bank loans for the 3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc .
One of the major selling points used by Los Angeles financier Alfred Checchi in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds .
That was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and Washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover .
All 3.35 billion in debt for the deal was supplied by banks .
Charles Nathan co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc. says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs .
But the UAL collapse he says may tell you it 's not going to work that easily .
David Batchelder a mergers adviser in La Jolla Calif. who aided Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis on the bids which put both UAL and NWA in play as takeover candidates this year says that banks have been preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing .
Mr. Batchelder says that in the past banks would normally have loaned 65 % of a total buy-out price with the loans secured by the target company 's assets .
Another 20 % of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans .
Mr. Checchi 's purchase of NWA Mr. Batchelder notes was probably the most aggressive to date with bank debt at 85 % of the purchase price .
But Mr. Batchelder says that Citicorp 's failure to deliver on its promise to raise the UAL bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group is very distressing to potential users of a highly-confident letter from commercial banks .
His client Mr. Davis used just such a letter from Citicorp in pursuing UAL Citicorp later agreed to work with a competing UAL buy-out group .
Executives of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan declined to comment on either the UAL situation or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers .
In the wake of Campeau 's problems prices of junk bonds tumbled throwing into doubt the ability of corporate acquirers to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales .
Mark Solow senior managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. says the falloff in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in structuring takeovers .
But he warns that banks will have to have enough discipline not to make loans that are too risky .
In fact Manufacturers Hanover said in its third-quarter earnings report that fees from syndicating loans to other banks dropped 48 % to 21 million .
We did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor says a bank spokesman .
James B. Lee head of syndications and private placements at Chemical Banking Corp. said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of one-stop shopping for takeover finance .
As evidence he cites yesterday 's arrangement for the final financing of a 3 billion bid for American Medical International Inc. in which Chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor .
Beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers .
Arthur Fleischer Jr. a takeover lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson notes that a political and emotional bias has developed against junk bonds .
One hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was Paramount Communications Inc. in its initial offer to acquire Time Inc. for 10.7 billion or 175 a share .
A Paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial not political drawbacks of junk bonds .
But some observers believe Paramount Chairman Martin Davis wanted to avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for Time .
In the end Mr. Davis used junk bonds so that he could raise Paramount 's bid to 200 a share .
Some Monday-morning quarterbacks said the initial lower bid without junk bonds was a factor in his losing the company .
Time eluded Paramount by acquiring Warner Communications Inc .
The success of the NWA financing and the failure of the UAL deal also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by Japanese banks .
Japanese banks accounted for 50 % of the NWA bank debt according to a report by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner .
But it was broad-scale rejection by Japanese banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy UAL .
Citicorp and Chase are attempting to put together a new lower bid .
Takanori Mizuno chief economist of the Institute for Financial Affairs Inc. a Tokyo research center on finance and economics says The junk bond market became very jittery and there 's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of LBO companies .
Harley-Davidson Inc. filed suit in federal court here alleging that a group that holds 6.2 % of its stock made false deceptive and misleading statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements .
Harley-Davidson 's complaint claims that the group led by investor Malcolm I. Glazer violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15 % of the company 's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filing eventually was made it did n't disclose the group 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law .
Mr. Glazer could n't immediately be reached to comment .
But when Harley last week publicly questioned the legality of the group 's filing procedures the Rochester N.Y. investor said we complied with every law and he denied any wrongdoing .
The Glazer group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in Harley-Davidson or seek representation on the company 's board .
Harley has said it does n't intend to be acquired by the Glazer group or any other party .
Inland Steel Industries Inc. battered by lower volume and higher costs posted a 75 % drop in third-quarter earnings .
The nation 's fourth-largest steelmaker earned 18.3 million or 43 cents a share compared with 61 million or 1.70 a share a year earlier when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing .
Sales fell to 981.2 million from 1.02 billion .
The earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter 's 45.3 million or 1.25 a share .
Moreover the earnings were well below analysts ' expectations of about 1.16 a share .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Inland closed yesterday at 35.875 a share down 1 .
The company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market especially in the automotive sector .
However the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter .
Third-quarter shipments slipped 7 % from the year-ago period and 17 % from this year 's second quarter .
Profit of steel shipped for the company 's steel segment slid to 26 a ton from 66 a ton a year earlier and 57 a ton a quarter earlier .
Analysts noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices for steel products .
Charles Bradford an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar hot-rolled and structural steel .
Structural steel which primarily serves the construction market was especially hurt by a 15 % price drop Mr. Bradford said .
The company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material repair and maintenance and labor costs .
The increased labor costs became effective Aug. 1 under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers union .
Meanwhile the company 's service center segment which saw operating profit drop to 11.5 million from 30.7 million a year ago experienced much of the same demand and cost problems as well as start-up costs associated with a coil processing facility in Chicago and an upgraded computer information system .
Inland Chairman Frank W. Luerssen said the company 's short-term outlook is clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets .
However he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter .
In the first nine months profit was 113 million or 3.04 a share on sales of 3.19 billion compared with 204.5 million or 5.76 a share on sales of 3.03 billion a year earlier .
The seismic activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth .
When things are quiet low volatility the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately .
However when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure the more earthquake-resistant it is the better its chance for survival .
America 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully aftershock-resistant .
Investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information .
That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity .
And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks .
In today 's markets specialists on the New York Stock Exchange and upstairs market makers in the over-the-counter market are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process .
When they halt trading all market liquidity is gone .
And when any component of the market cash futures or options loses liquidity the price discovery system the way prices are determined becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time .
Last Friday the 13th as well as two years ago this week the markets became unlinked .
When that happened seismic tremors of fear much like the shock waves created by an earthquake coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility .
Lack of important needed information can cause fear .
Fear is the father of panic .
Panic frequently results in irrational behavior .
And in financial markets irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe .
When market tremors start it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve buy and sell orders at various prices be made available to all not just to market makers .
Because of a lack of information and access many investors including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed because of their ignorance of important market information .
To add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets a modern electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena and the information that would automatically accompany such access by investors particularly institutional investors .
Contrary to some opinions the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole .
What market makers provide is immediacy a very valuable service .
Liquidity is not a service .
It is a market attribute the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news .
Market makers buy what investors wish to sell their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors and at a profit .
As a result while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker which is micro-liquidity for the investor the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction The unwanted position is still an unwanted position only the identity of the seller has changed .
In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers a result of some post-1987 crash studies also increases market volatility since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time the more selling pressure is overhanging the market .
In an open electronic system any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve buy and sell orders at each price entered by dealers and investors alike and to enter and execute orders .
Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis .
Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field Congress sought and called a national market system not yet achieved almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975 .
Last Friday 's market gyrations did not result in severe aftershocks .
Were we smart or just lucky .
I 'm not certain .
But I am sure we need to maximize our earthquake protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock-damping power to our nation 's markets .
Mr. Peake is chairman of his own consulting company in Englewood N.J .
NOW YOU SEE IT now you do n't .
The recession that is .
The economy 's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up .
So often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane .
For the past seven years investors have had the wind at their backs in the form of a generally growing economy .
Some may have forgotten and some younger ones may never have experienced what it 's like to invest during a recession .
Different tactics are called for as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher .
For those investors who believe or fear that 1990 will be a recession year many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio .
In a nutshell pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in defensive industries .
A heavy dose of cash is prescribed along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds preferably government bonds .
It 's tempting to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand .
But that may not be possible because recessions often take investors by surprise .
They always seem to come a bit later than you expect .
When they do hit they hit fast says David A. Wyss chief financial economist at the Data Resources division of McGraw-Hill Inc .
Though he himself does n't expect a recession soon Mr. Wyss advises people who do that the best thing to be in is long that is 20-year to 30-year Treasury bonds .
The reason is simple Mr. Wyss says Interest rates almost always decline during recession .
As surely as a seesaw tilts falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds .
They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do .
That effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds .
But short-term bonds ca n't rise too much because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon .
Long-term bonds with many years left before maturity swing more widely in price .
But not just any bonds will do .
Corporate bonds are usually not a good bet in a recession Mr. Wyss says .
As times get tougher investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts .
This hurts the price of corporate bonds .
Also he notes most corporate bonds are callable .
That means that a corporation after a specified amount of time has passed can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value plus in some cases a sweetener .
When interest rates have dropped it makes sense for corporations to do just that they then save on interest costs .
But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny .
If corporate bonds are bad in recessions junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all .
It 's an absolute necessity to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing says Avner Arbel professor of finance at Cornell University .
Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside and this could be a disaster .
Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government .
During an economic slump local tax revenues often go down raising the risks associated with at least some municipals .
And like corporates many municipal bonds are callable .
But a few experts going against the consensus do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing .
One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co. a brokerage house in Houston who thinks that we 're either in a recession or about to go into one .
What 's more he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual Once the downturn comes it 's going to be very hard to reverse .
Investors he advises should be cautious holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds .
Because he sees a 5 % to 6 % base rate of inflation in the economy he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon .
Instead Mr. Beach says investors probably should be carrying a very high level of cash by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills .
Greg Confair president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown Pa. also recommends that investors go heavily for cash .
He is n't sure a recession is coming but says the other likely alternative reignited inflation is just as bad .
This late in an expansion the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession Mr. Confair says .
The Federal Reserve Board 's plan for a soft landing he says requires the Fed to navigate an ever-narrowing corridor .
A soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all Mr. Confair adds .
It has to be engineered over and over again month after month .
He believes that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw .
And in a sense that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios .
It comes down to a question of whether to try to time the market .
For people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad stocks have been rewarding long-term investments .
Most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9 % to 10 % including both dividends and price appreciation .
That 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid .
Moreover because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing .
Trying to time the economy is a mistake says David Katz chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York .
Mr. Katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years .
Investors who listened and lightened up on stocks have just hurt themselves he says .
Mr. Katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70 % of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy .
Frequent trading runs up high commission costs .
And the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time .
Still few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming .
After all in all five recessions since 1960 stocks declined .
According to Ned Davis president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis Fla. the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21 % and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started .
By the time a recession is official two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product much of the damage to stocks has already been done and in the typical case the recession is already half over .
About six months before a recession ends stocks typically begin to rise again as investors anticipate a recovery .
The average recession lasts about a year .
Unfortunately though recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't reliably be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases .
But whatever their advice about timing none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession .
For the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks professionals have a number of suggestions .
Mr. Katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios that is low prices in relation to the company 's earnings per share .
Low P-E stocks he says vastly outperform others during a recession or bear market .
In good times he says they lag a bit but overall they provide superior performance .
Prof. Arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small companies .
Small-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession he says .
And in any case he argues stocks of small companies are almost as overpriced as they were Sept. 30 1987 just before the crash .
For example Mr. Arbel says stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow .
Cash flow basically earnings plus depreciation is one common gauge of a company 's financial health .
That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash Mr. Arbel says .
And it 's way above the ratio 7.5 times cash flow that bigger companies are selling for .
Another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in defensive industries .
Food tobacco drugs and utilities are the classic examples .
Recession or not people still eat smoke and take medicine when they 're sick .
George Putnam III editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston offers one final tip for recession-wary investors .
Keep some money available for opportunities he says .
If the recession does hit there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest .
Mr. Dorfman covers investing issues from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau .
Some industry groups consistently weather the storm better than others .
The following shows the number of times these industries outperformed the Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index during the first six months of the past seven recessions .
Bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt .
But while the overall market improved the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count casualties even as junk-bond prices rose .
Yesterday Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it postponed a 220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by York International Corp .
And Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a 475 million debenture offering by Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. that was still being negotiated late last night .
The issue by Chicago & North Western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar .
Some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk .
Since last week 's junk-bond market debacle many new issues of high-yield high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back delayed or dropped .
On Wednesday Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines ' junk-bond offering to 71 million from 150 million .
Salomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co. 's 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction .
Last week the Grand Union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock .
Prudential-Bache said the York issue was delayed because of market conditions .
Everything is going through firehoops right now and Chicago & North Western is no exception said Mariel Clemensen vice president high-yield research at Citicorp .
Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals .
Dan Baldwin managing director of high-yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management said the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured in part because several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package .
If you 're going to take the risk in this market you want something extra .
Mr. Baldwin likes the offering .
But several mutual-fund managers nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class .
While they consider the Chicago & North Western issue to be good they do n't view it as the best .
To lure buyers to the Chicago & North Western bonds portfolio managers said Donaldson Lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10 % equity kicker .
The bonds are expected to have a 14 1\/2 % coupon rate .
The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10 % of the stock of CNW Corp. Chicago & North Western 's parent company .
Donaldson Lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring .
According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations the 10 % of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank Blackstone Group which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5 % each .
That would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60 % stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15 % .
Despite the problems with new issues high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary or resell market .
Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership rising one point .
In the Treasury market the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point or 8.75 for each 1,000 face amount .
The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows .
That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower .
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2 % last month slightly lower than some economists had expected .
But there were also rumors yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term Treasurys .
Short-term Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher .
Yesterday the Fed executed four-day matched sales a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system .
The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the Fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 3\/4 % at which it has been hovering around during the past week .
The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans .
It is considered an early signal of Fed credit policy changes .
The fact that they did four-day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively .
They are telling us that 8 3\/4 % is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate said Robert Chandross at Lloyds Bank PLC .
Treasury Securities The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 25\/32 to yield 7.955 % compared with 100 29\/32 to yield 8.032 % Wednesday .
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 9\/32 to yield 7.937 % compared with 99 26\/32 to yield 8.007 % .
Short-term rates rose yesterday .
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % .
Meanwhile the Treasury sold 9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday .
The average yield on the bills was 7.35 % down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21 .
Yesterday 's yield was the lowest since 7.22 % on July 27 .
Here are details of the auction Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it .
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year .
Corporate Issues Junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities .
Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1\/4 to 1\/2 point with so-called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one-point gains .
Petrolane Gas Service 's 13 1\/4 % debentures traded at 102 after trading around par earlier this week and RJR 's 13 1\/2 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5\/8 after trading at below par earlier this week .
Investment-grade bonds were unchanged .
Municipals Activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector .
Traders estimated that more than 140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers .
There was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios .
According to market participants the bonds were met with decent bids but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield .
Away from the general obligation sector activity was modest .
Long dollar bonds were flat to up 3\/8 point .
New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was up 3\/8 at 98 3\/8 bid to yield about 7.32 % down 0.03 percentage point .
The debt of some California issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday 's massive earthquake although traders said market participants remained cautious .
California expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its 1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated 500 million to 1 billion in damages resulting from the quake according to a state official .
It 's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve said Cindy Katz assistant director of California 's department of finance although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated .
Meanwhile new issuance was slow .
The largest sale in the competitive arena was a 55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority .
A balance of 25.8 million remained in late order-taking according to the lead manager .
Mortgage-Backed Securities Mortgage securities generally ended 6\/32 to 9\/32 point higher but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts .
Premium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon rates of 13 % and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by Congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages .
Ginnie Mae 13 % securities were down about 1\/4 at 109 30\/32 .
If the refinancing plan clears Congress there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities hurting any investor paying much above par for them .
In the current-coupon sector a shift in the Treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings .
Ginnie Mae 9 % securities ended at 98 6\/32 up 9\/32 and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 % securities were at 97 10\/32 up 6\/32 .
The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 9.42 % to a 12-year average life assumption as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48 .
While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the Treasury yield curve underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable .
Two new Remics totaling 900 million were announced by Freddie Mac yesterday .
Foreign Bonds British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson .

THE PANHANDLER approaches makes his pitch .
It may be straightforward he wants money for food or incredibly convoluted his sister is at this very moment near death in Hoboken he has lost his wallet and has only 1.22 in change to put toward a bus ticket costing 3.83 and wo n't you give him the difference .
No .
Well how about a loan he 'll take your name and address Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this .
But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer famine child abuse or what have you .
Most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals .
But will it .
In a distressing number of cases no .
In fact the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler at least he has no overhead and he might even be telling the truth .
Last year more than 100 billion was donated to the nation 's 400,000 charities .
While the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for it 's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in expenses claimed by other operators including fraudulent expenses .
In many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries .
It 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs high-living operators and downright fraud .
But the problem clearly is widespread and persistent .
State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging .
The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year measuring them against minimum standards for accountability for accuracy and honesty in solicitation and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established .
The Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program .
Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test .
Which it should be added does n't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway .
Without a microscope and a subpoena it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself .
On this basis there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one says David Ormstedt an assistant attorney general in Connecticut .
A lot of donors just get taken .
Including those he contends who put about 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center .
The state has sued these charities in state court complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent 82 % says Mr. Ormstedt went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives for fur coats trips to Florida Lucullan restaurant tabs .
The telephone number for the charity in Shelton Conn. has been disconnected and the former officials could n't be located .
Running a charity does cost money but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed .
The Arthritis Foundation the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90 % of their income on programs not overhead .
With some other charities however it s the other way around .
The fledgling National Children 's Cancer Society for example took in 2.5 million last year to finance bone-marrow transplants for children .
By the time it paid its expenses it only had 120,000 left not enough to treat even one child .
The state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago along with Telesystems Marketing Inc. its Houston-based fund raiser .
Both deny wrongdoing .
The charity admits spending a lot on fund raising but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come .
Michael Burns president of Telesystems says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children 's .
Meanwhile a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds .
Enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising .
State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income usually half that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court .
It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression .
This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently .
The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere .
In making cases the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers .
Illinois for instance currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there .
Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give .
Attorneys general in several states including Illinois are already suing Watson & Hughey Co. an Alexandria Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America .
According to the Illinois attorney general 's suit Watson & Hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes and could win up to an additional 1,000 on top of them if they contributed as little as 7 .
But the total value of the prizes was only 5,000 and most winners will receive just 10 cents according to the attorney general 's office .
The suit is still pending in Illinois state court .
Watson & Hughey has denied the allegations in court officials decline to comment further .
While they can target some of the most obvious miscreants enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface .
There are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious operators they say that it is probably impossible to stop them all .
One maneuver the public education gambit .
The solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue .
What it does n't say is that the entire campaign may be the fund-raising letter itself .
All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as Do n't smoke .
or Wear suntan lotion ' says William Webster attorney general of Missouri .
By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters .
Mr. Webster cites a four-page mailing from the United Cancer Council that offers a chance to win 5,000 in gold bullion to those giving as little as 5 to cancer education .
A few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages .
I think some people may believe they 're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters he says .
Officials at the Washington D.C.-based charity did n't return repeated phone calls .
Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs .
The established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it .
We ca n't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name .
Most of them do n't last for long but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they are n't connected with us says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association .
And sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it .
A couple in Rockford Ill. raised 12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving without permission from the group .
MADD did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for 613 along with a letter saying that was the charity 's share .
The Illinois Attorney General won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without MADD 's permission .
The couple could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left Rockford law enforcement officials report .
Denise McDonald a spokeswoman for MADD says It 's scary because anybody could do this .

Overhead costs at some of the largest charities in millions of dollars British Airways PLC a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp. washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of United Airlines .
Specifically the British carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for UAL .
In addition British Air officially withdrew its support for the previous 300-a-share bid in a terse statement that said the original deal is closed .
Company officials said later that British Airways believes its involvement in the UAL buy-out ended last Friday when the buy-out group which also includes UAL 's management and pilot union failed to obtain financing for the 6.79 billion transaction .
The carrier stopped short of saying it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for UAL .
However company officials said they plan to take no initiatives to resurrect the transaction and are n't aware of any restructured bid in the making .
Collectively the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for UAL will ever get off the ground .
The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last Friday with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place .
However in response to the British Air decision United 's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out .
Pilot union Chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky said advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL 's board at the earliest time possible .
Pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without British Air 's participation .
UAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement .
UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf who is leading the management end of the buy-out has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal .
In another setback yesterday United 's machinist union asked the Treasury Department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws .
In an effort to derail the buy-out the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission Transportation Department and Labor Department .
But there was one bright spot yesterday .
The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake .
The pilot union the only one to support the buy-out thus far said the flight attendants ' decision enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable .
Still without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid .
Under the previous plan British Air would have received a 15 % stake in UAL in exchange for a 750 million equity investment with a 75 % stake going to UAL employees and 10 % to UAL management .
British Air officials said the airline 's chairman Lord King was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier .
The previous reports were based on remarks by British Air 's chief financial officer Derek Stevens who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL 's stock in the past week .
UAL stock dropped 1.625 yesterday to 190.125 on volume of 923,500 shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
UAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement .
In an interview Wednesday with Dow Jones Professional Investor Report Mr. Stevens said We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all .
We 're not rushing into anything .
We do n't want to be party to a second rejection .
Indeed British Air seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment .
The original transaction fell through on the same day British Air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the British succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution .
The carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its American counterparts .
The buy-out consortium ceased to exist because our American partners were not capable of organizing the financing a British Air spokesman said .
British Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the Transportation Department forced Northwest 's Airlines ' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in that carrier .
Most of the department 's statements since the Northwest transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in U.S. carriers .
Even before British Air 's announcement pilot union leaders had been meeting in Chicago yesterday to consider their options .
The leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing Wednesday by the union 's advisers Lazard Freres & Co. and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .
They also unanimously re-elected Mr. Dubinsky the union chairman who has led the pilots ' 2 1\/2-year fight to take control of the airline .
UAL 's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid .
They have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction .
The buy-out fell through after Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. the lead banks in the transaction failed to obtain 7.2 billion in financing needed for the plan .
