ment had n't mastered the technology needed to retrofit the entire Cypress structure .
Moreover other officials noted snafus in transportation funding that the state has experienced over the years may have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting even if it were technologically feasible .
Knowledgeable employees said the retrofitting which had n't yet been budgeted was part of a planned three-stage reinforcement of the Cypress structure begun by the California transportation department several years ago .
The Cypress reinforcement project itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes .
The state began such work after a 1971 tremblor in Southern California when numerous bridges collapsed .
We had just finished phase two of the Cypress project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock a state DOT engineer said .
After completing installation of the jackets on one frame of the freeway last year the state DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers to draw up a final design .
Knowledgeable employees said the project had been stymied somewhat by the difficulty of designing the jackets .
The procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with steel then connecting them more securely to the double-decker roadbed .
The employees also said the project may have been snagged by budgetary concerns .
One preliminary estimate put the retrofitting cost at as much as 50 million .
The collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials .
Gov. George Deukmejian who said he had been assured by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake called for an immediate investigation .
I want to know who made the decision that it was safe for 186,000 people to use every day said Richard Katz a state legislator who is chairman of the California Assembly 's transportation committee .
He said he would convene hearings within two weeks .
The Cypress structure opened in June 1957 and as such like many buildings in the San Francisco Bay area does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support .
The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake .
Transportation department officials however said they were as surprised as anyone by the Cypress destruction .
They said previous earthquakes suggested that multiple-column viaducts would stand up well although they were working on ways to bolster them .
Unfortunately there is only one laboratory for developing techniques to withstand earthquakes and that is an earthquake said Burch Bachtold San Francisco district director for the transportation department .
He said We know of no technology that exists anywhere in the world that would allow us to reinforce the columns .
Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara said it rescheduled to Nov. 29 a special shareholder meeting to vote on a 75 million stock-for-debt exchange .
The meeting had been scheduled for Nov. 10 but the company delayed the meeting to allow time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the proposal .
As part of a restructuring announced earlier this year the company proposed in August to exchange 168 newly issued common shares for each 1,000 face value of debt .
However that figure could be revised Financial Corp. said .
Currently the company has about six million common shares outstanding .
If all the debt was converted about 13 million new shares would be issued .
In composite trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange Financial Corp. closed at 1.125 unchanged .
The debt consists of 50 million of 13 3\/8 % subordinated notes due 1998 and 25 million of 9 % convertible subordinated debentures due 2012 .
Financial Corp. also is proposing to exchange each of its 130,000 outstanding shares of cumulative convertible preferred series A stock for two shares of common .
After years of quarreling over Bonn 's Ostpolitik West Germany and the U.S. appear to have shifted onto a united course in Eastern Europe .
Bonn and Washington have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit .
Both hope to encourage pressure for change in East bloc countries still ruled by Stalinist holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for Poland Hungary and to a lesser extent the Soviet Union .
West German officials also have the special goal of holding out hope for East Germany 's fledgling reform movement .
The change taking place in the Soviet Union Poland and Hungary has aroused new hope in both German states that reforms will be undertaken in East Germany and that relations between the two German states too will get better said Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher .
Addressing a conference of the New York-based Institute for East-West Security Studies in Frankfurt yesterday Mr. Genscher said History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities that emerge from these reforms .
The ultimate aim of Western support for East bloc reforms he said is to create an equitable and stable peaceful order in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals .
Mr. Genscher and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher in separate speeches at the conference appealed for more Western contributions to economic reforms and business development in Hungary and Poland .
Bonn and Washington are leading supporters of Poland 's request for a 1 billion stand-by credit from the International Monetary Fund .
We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in Hungary and in Poland to succeed .
We are prepared to support those changes said Mr. Mosbacher .
U.S. curbs on the exports of sensitive technology to East bloc countries will remain in place however .
Meanwhile the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday approved an 837.5 million aid package for Poland and Hungary that more than doubles the amount President Bush had requested .
The package was brought to the House just 15 days after it was introduced indicating Congress 's eagerness to reward Poland and Hungary for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reforms .
The legislation approved 345-47 and sent to the Senate establishes two enterprise funds to be governed by independent nonprofit boards which will make loans and investments in new business ventures in Hungary and Poland .
The Polish fund would be seeded with 160 million the Hungarian fund with 40 million .
In addition a group of 24 industrialized countries including the U.S. and Japan and coordinated by the European Community Commission has promised Poland and Hungary trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to 1.11 billion through the European Investment Bank while the EC plans 222 million in direct aid .
When Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels to Poland Nov. 9 he is expected to take with him a promise of three billion West German marks 1.6 billion in new credit guarantees for industrial projects .
Last week Bonn agreed to reschedule 2.5 billion marks in Polish debt that came due last year .
In addition a one billion mark credit dating from 1974 is to be written off .
Poland 's plan to switch to a free-market economy by 1991 is hampered by a foreign debt load of 39.2 billion .
West Germany also has increased its credit guarantees to Hungary by 500 million marks to 1.5 billion marks as the emerging democratic state rushes through its own economic reforms including a broad privatization of state-owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment .
An additional 500 million marks in credit-backing was promised by the West German state governments of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg .
Deutsche Bank AG which last year arranged a three billion mark credit for the Soviet Union is now moving to become the first West German bank to set up independent business offices in Hungary and Poland as they shift to free-market economies .
A maxim of Frankfurt banking holds that wherever Deutsche Bank goes other West German banks follow .
Indeed at least four other West German banks are believed to be making inquiries .
Mattel Inc. said third-quarter net income rose 73 % to 38 million or 76 cents a share from 21.9 million or 45 cents a share a year ago .
Revenue rose 34 % to 410 million from 306.6 million a year earlier .
Mattel 's world-wide volume has grown 25 % in a climate of relatively flat industry sales said John W. Amerman chairman .
He said the toy company 's prospects for a strong fourth quarter are also good .
Mattel attributed the jump in quarter net to strong world-wide sales of its Barbie doll Hot Wheels cars Disney toys and other well-known toy lines .
The company also cited retail trade and consumer demand for new products introduced this year such as Cherry Merry Muffin and Turtle Tots .
For the nine months Mattel net more than doubled to 58.9 million or 1.19 a share from 25.4 million or 53 cents a share a year ago .
Revenue rose 25 % to 877.6 million from 702.4 million .
Mattel said the company 's sale of rights to land and buildings at its Hawthorne Calif. headquarters resulted in a 13 million charge to third-quarter operating profit .
The charge did n't affect net for the quarter as it was offset by tax benefits .
Mattel has purchased a new headquarters building in El Segundo Calif. which it will occupy by the end of next year .
Democracy can be cruel to politicians Sometimes it forces them to make choices .
Now that the Supreme Court opened the door on the subject of abortion politicians are squinting under the glare of democratic choice .
Their discomfort is a healthy sign for the rest of us .
Republicans are squinting most painfully at least at first which is only fair because they 've been shielded the most .
So long as abortion was a question for litigation not legislation Republicans could find political security in absolutism .
They could attract one-issue voters by adopting the right-to-life movement 's strongest position even as pro-choice Republicans knew this mattered little on an issue monopolized by the court .
Now it matters .
Much of Washington thought it detected George Bush in a characteristic waffle on abortion the past week .
Only a month ago he 'd warned Congress not to pass legislation to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest .
Last Friday after Congress passed it anyway he hinted he was looking for compromise .
Was the man who once was pro-choice but later pro-life converting again .
In fact Mr. Bush 's dance was more wiggle than waffle .
Pro-life advocates say the White House never wavered over the veto .
Christopher Smith R. N.J. a pro-life leader in the House suggested a compromise that would have adapted restrictive language from rape and incest exceptions in the states .
The White House never eager for a fight was happy to try which is why George Bush said he was looking for flexibility last week .
When Democrats refused to budge pro-life Republicans met at the White House with Chief of Staff John Sununu on Monday and Mr. Bush quickly signaled a veto .
Amid charges of timidity on Panama and elsewhere the president was n't about to offend his most energetic constituency .
The GOP doubters were in Congress .
In last week 's House vote 41 Republicans defected .
After the vote Connecticut Rep. Nancy Johnson rounded up nearly as many signatures on a letter to Mr. Bush urging him not to veto .
Even such a pro-life stalwart as Sen. Orrin Hatch R. Utah had counseled some kind of compromise .
The Senate passed the same bill yesterday with a veto-proof majority of 67 .
The manuevering illustrates an emerging Republican donnybrook pacified since the early 1980s .
At the 1988 GOP convention abortion was barely discussed at all though delegates were evenly divided on the question of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment .
Ms. Johnson made a passionate statement to the platform committee but she was talking to herself .
Now many Republicans are listening .
They 're frightened by what they see in New Jersey and especially Virginia where pro-life GOP candidates for governor are being pummeled on abortion .
Eddie Mahe a Republican consultant says the two GOP candidates could have avoided trouble if they had framed the issue first .
In Virginia Marshall Coleman and his running mate Eddy Dalton are both on the defensive for opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest .
But Mr. Mahe adds The net loser in the next few years is the right-to-life side .
Darla St. Martin of the National Right to Life Committee says exit polls from the 1988 election had single-issue pro-life voters giving Mr. Bush about five more percentage points of support than pro-choice voters gave Michael Dukakis .
But the Supreme Court 's opening of debate may have changed even that .
GOP pollster Neil Newhouse of the Wirthlin Group says polls this summer showed that the single-issue voters had about evened out .
Polls are no substitute for principle but they 'll do for some politicians .
The Republican danger is that abortion could become for them what it 's long been for Democrats a divisive litmus test .
It 's already that in the Bush administration at least for any job in which abortion is even remotely an issue .
Oklahoma official Robert Fulton lost a chance for a senior job in the Department of Health and Human Services after right-to-life activists opposed him .
Caldwell Butler a conservative former congressman was barred from a Legal Services post after he gave wrong answers on abortion .
Even the president 's doctor Burton Lee has said on the record that he 'd love to be surgeon general but could n't pass the pro-life test .
In the case of HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan the litmus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the Republican coalition .
After Mr. Sullivan waffled on abortion last year the White House appeased right-to-lifers by surrounding him with pro-life deputies .
Their views on health care and welfare did n't much matter though HHS spends billions a year on both .
It makes only a handful of abortion-related decisions .
Though Democrats can gloat at all this for now they may want to contain their glee .
On abortion their own day will come .
Eventually even Republicans will find a way to frame the issue in ways that expose pro-choice absolutism .
Does the candidate favor parental consent for teen-age abortions .
The pro-choice lobby does n't .
What about banning abortions in the second and third trimesters .
The lobby says no again .
Democracy is forcing the abortion debate toward healthy compromise toward the unpolarizing middle .
Roe v. Wade pre-empted political debate so the extremes blossomed .
Now the ambivalent middle a moral majority of sorts is reasserting itself .
Within a few years the outcome in most states is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted but not completely banned .
This is where the voters are which is where politicians usually end up .

The Federal Trade Commission ruled that five major title-insurance companies illegally fixed prices for title search-and-examination services by participating in joint rating bureaus in six states .
The FTC ordered the companies not to use rating bureaus in those six states .
The commission order named the following companies Ticor Title Insurance Co. of California a unit of Los Angeles-based Ticor Chicago Title Insurance Co. and Safeco Title Insurance Co. units of Chicago Title & Trust Co. Lawyers Title Insurance Corp. a unit of Richmond Va.-based Universal Corp. and Stewart Title Guaranty Co. a unit of Houston-based Stewart Information Services Corp .
Chicago Title & Trust acquired Safeco in 1987 and changed the unit 's name to Security Union Title Insurance Co .
The FTC ruled that the companies violated federal antitrust law by fixing rates in the following states New Jersey Pennsylvania Connecticut Wisconsin Arizona and Montana .
The FTC first issued an administrative complaint in the case in 1985 .
John Christie a lawyer here for the two Chicago Title & Trust units accused the FTC of second-guessing state-level regulations with which he said his clients had complied .
I expect all the companies to appeal he added .
A lawyer for Lawyers Title said that because the named companies no longer use the type of cooperative rating bureaus attacked by the FTC the commission 's order wo n't have much practical impact .
Officials for the other named companies did n't return telephone calls seeking comment .

First they get us to buy computers so we can get more information .
Then the computers give us more information than we can ever read .
Now they plan to sell us products that sift through all the information to give us what we really want to know .
The products range from computer-edited personal newsletters to systems that sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires .
Filtered news is what people want says Esther Dyson editor of Release 1.0 an industry newsletter that spots new developments .
Most people read 10 times more than necessary in order to find out what they really need .
Geoffrey Goodfellow who dropped out of high school back in the 1970s to manage a computer network at a California research firm says Old network hands have started to turn off the network because they do n't have time to wade through the muck .
Mr. Goodfellow has started a Menlo Park Calif. company called Anterior Technology that provides human editors for public electronic networks .
I see it as a sewage treatment plant he says .
A new product NewsEdge carries five business news wires simultaneously into a user 's computer and beeps and flashes whenever an article appears that is of interest to the user .
The product developed by Desktop Data Corp. a new company based in Waltham Mass. scans the wires looking for articles that contain key words specified by the user .
One early user David Semmel a Chicago venture capitalist and investor in Desktop Data says he uses it to track takeover developments .
He says he told NewsEdge to look for stories containing such words as takeover acquisition acquire LBO tender merger junk and halted .
I 'm pretty confident I 'm catching everything he says .
NewsEdge is pricey 7,500 a year for a limited version 40,000 a year if the cost of all the news wires is included .
And it works best in high-powered personal computers .
But some investors and consultants who have tried it are enthusiastic .
Jeffrey Tarter editor of SoftLetter a Watertown Mass. industry newsletter says I 've seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering information .
This is the first time I 've seen something I could imagine a lot of people using .
NewsEdge uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by Reuters McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones & Co. as well as PR Newswire which carries corporate press releases .
An FM receiver attached to a user 's personal computer receives the information .
Some organizations have devised their own systems to sort through news wire items as they come in .
George Goodwin an account manager at Royal Bank of Canada adapted a Lotus Development Corp. program called Agenda to sort through international news wires .
It automatically selects stories from particular countries for reading by the international bankers responsible for lending in those areas .
For those who do n't need their personalized information moment by moment some services are offering overnight newsletters .
Individual Inc. a new company in Brookline Mass. uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton to automatically produce customized newsletters it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m. the next day .
We are operating an information refinery that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge says Yosi Amram founder and president .
The daily newsletter which is n't widely available yet will have a base cost of 2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters McGraw Hill United Press International two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service .
One early user is NEC Corp. 's U.S. printer marketing arm .
They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition Mr. Amram says .
It also tracks personnel and financial announcements by NEC 's distributors and customers .
Individual Inc. 's technology goes beyond word searches by using a computerized thesaurus .
If a customer asks for stories about IBM the computer will also supply stories that mention I.B.M. International Business Machines or Big Blue Mr. Amram says .
Moreover Individual Inc. 's computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber 's interest area .
It compares the position of key words in the story words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value .
And it calculates how often the words appear in the story compared with how often they appear in the entire data base .
The higher the ratio of hits to total words the higher the presumed value to the reader .
Pinpoint Information Corp. Chantilly Va. a producer of 1,800-a-year personalized newsletters about the computer industry that started full operation last month relies on 12 human readers to code news releases by topic in order to select items for each subscriber .
The computers find all the key words they can but the editors confirm every one .
Computer picking is n't perfect says Harvey Golomb president and founder of Pinpoint .
The humans also write abstracts of articles from some 200 computer industry publications .
Once all the articles are coded and put in a data base Pinpoint 's computers pick the most relevant for each subscriber and lay them out in a three-to-five-page newsletter format each newsletter is sent directly from the computer to the subscriber 's fax machine .
Mr. Gol
