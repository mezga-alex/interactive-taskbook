loss of million or a share A year earlier the savings bank had earnings of million or cents a share For the nine months it had a loss of million or a share after earnings of million or a share in the period Great American said it increased its loan-loss reserves by million after reviewing its loan portfolio raising its total loan and real estate reserves to million Before the loan-loss addition it said it had operating profit of million for the quarter The move followed a round of similar increases by other lenders against Arizona real estate loans reflecting a continuing decline in that market In addition to the increased reserve the savings bank took a special charge of million representing general and administrative expenses from staff reductions and other matters and it posted a million reduction in expected mortgage servicing fees reflecting the fact that more borrowers are prepaying their mortgages Arbitragers were the only big losers in the collapse of UAL Corp stock Look at what happened to UAL chairman Stephen M Wolf and its chief financial officer John C Pope On a day some United Airlines employees wanted Mr Wolf fired and takeover stock speculators wanted his scalp Messrs Wolf and Pope saw their prospective personal fortunes continue to plummet as shares of UAL United parent company dived on the Big Board to close at Including Monday plunge that has given the two executives paper losses of million based on what they would have realized had the pilots and management-led buy-out of UAL gone through at a share When bank financing for the buy-out collapsed last week so did UAL stock Even if the banks resurrect a financing package at a share the two executives would still get about million less than they stood to gain in the initial transaction Mr Wolf owns UAL shares and has options to buy another at each In the buyout that totaled about million By yesterday close of trading it was good for a paltry million Of course Mr Wolf years old has some savings He left his last two jobs at Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger with combined stock-option gains of about million and UAL gave him a million bonus when it hired him His salary was with a bonus The old Mr Pope has changed jobs enough at least the right ones to stash away that kind of money United paid him a bonus to lure him away from American Airlines and he was paid a salary of last year with a bonus Mr Pope owns UAL shares and has options to buy another at each That came to a combined million under the buy-out but just million at yesterday close Of the combined million the two men were scheduled to reap under the buy-out they agreed to invest in the buy-out just million angering many of the thousands of workers asked to make pay concessions so the buy-out would be a success United directors voted themselves and their spouses lifetime access to the Friendly Skies free first-class travel and a year for life as well Conceivably in a scaled-back buy-out they could be bumped back to

yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board at down cents Reuben Mark chairman of Colgate-Palmolive Co said he is comfortable with analysts estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to between cents and a share That compares with per-share earnings from continuing operations of cents the year earlier including discontinued operations per-share was cents a year ago The per-share estimates mean the consumer-products company net income increased to between million and million from million the year-before period Analysts estimate Colgate world-wide third-quarter sales rose about to billion Mr Mark attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in Latin America Asia and Europe Results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit by Colgate U.S business Mr Mark said Operating profit at Colgate U.S household products and personal-care businesses jumped in the quarter Mr Mark added He said the improvement was a result of cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations blending two sales organizations and focusing more carefully the company promotional activities The estimated improvement in Colgate U.S operations took some analysts by surprise Colgate household products business which includes such brands as Fab laundry detergent and Ajax cleanser has been a weak performer Analysts estimate Colgate sales of household products in the U.S were flat for the quarter and they estimated operating margins at only to If you could say their business in the U.S was mediocre but great everywhere else that would be fine says Bonita Austin an analyst with Wertheim Schroder Co But it not mediocre it a real problem Mr Mark conceded that Colgate domestic business apart from its highly profitable Hill Pet Products unit has lagged We done a lot to improve U.S results and a lot more will be done Mr Mark said Improving profitability of U.S operations is an extremely high priority in the company To focus on its global

to read Maybe so if you can find where your favorite writer went Beantown scribes who spare no invective when taking on local luminaries such as Michael Pee Wee Dukakis or New England Patriots Coach Raymond Rev Ray Berry yesterday poured ridicule on new drawings of Globe columnists that replaced old photos in the revamped pages this week By late last night Globe Managing Editor Thomas Mulvoy bending to the will of his troops scrapped the new drawings For a few days at least he says no pictures or drawings of any kind will adorn the columns Trouble was nobody thought they looked right Globe columnist Mike Barnicle in the second attack on his employer in as many weeks averred that his shadowy countenance was so bad it looked like a face you find on a bottle of miracle elixir that promises to do away with diarrhea in our lifetime Mr Barnicle reminded readers that he still has forgiven Globe management for questioning a expense chit he submitted for parking his car while chasing a story I thought the drawing a cross between someone you spot whipping open his trench coat or a guy who boasted he been Charles Manson roommate for the last years he said Mr Barnicle was hardly

she sees a newspaper Lynn Staley the Globe assistant managing editor for design acknowledges that the visages were on the low end of the likeness spectrum Rival Boston Herald columnist Howie Carr who usually rails at Statehouse hacks and nepotism argued that the new drawings were designed to hide Mr Madden rapidly growing forehead and the facial defects of chinless Dan Shaughnessy a Globe sports columnist But think of the money you the reader will save on Halloween said Mr Barnicle Instead of buying masks for your kids just cut out the columnists pictures Deeply ingrained in both the book review Kissing Nature Good-bye by Stephen MacDonald Leisure Arts Sept and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity Is such a view justified In the absence of humans would the Earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term Clearly not About years ago the last ice age ended Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of North America northern Europe and Asia This global warming must have been entirely natural nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand hunter-gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves Furthermore no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming It is probably continuing and may well account for most of or all of present-day global warming I bow to no one in my regard for our terrestrial heritage but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the Dominant Culture to lock us into the capitalist-exploiters-greedy-American-consumers-global warming scenario as the sole model for discussion Jocelyn Tomkin Astronomy Department University of The Internal Revenue Service plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation In addition the tax-collecting agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new high-level positions to guide the agency a comptroller to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer to update the information system which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world The IRS also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer who will be hired from within the agency IRS Commissioner Fred T Goldberg said the changes are intended to bring accountability to the agency which has an annual budget of more than billion and collects about trillion a year My assessment and everyone assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget Mr Goldberg said And we do have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend billion properly Mr Goldberg who took over as head of the IRS in July has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency The IRS operates on a computer system designed in which it has been trying to modernize for years And the agency which operated throughout fiscal with a million budget shortfall has been under a hiring freeze since last fall The new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward enhancing its ability to collect more tax revenue I think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which in turn I believe will result in a significant increase in revenue he said The IRS hopes to fill the new positions soon Customarily it would appoint career civil servants from within the agency but Mr Goldberg said he plans to scour the world for the chief information officer and the comptroller Although the jobs will probably pay between and a year IRS officials are confident that they can attract top-notch candidates from the private sector You telling someone they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever Mr Goldberg said On the comptroller side you developing and making work financial controls governing a billion budget When Maj Moises Giroldi the leader of the abortive coup in Panama was buried his body bore several gunshot wounds a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs They were the signature of his adversary Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega The rebel officer slow and painful death at the headquarters of Panama squad was personally supervised by Gen Noriega says a U.S official with access to intelligence reports Leaping into rages sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust Mr Noriega has put to death some of his troops involved in the coup according to U.S officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City He is now changing the place he sleeps every night sometimes more than once a night His meals are most often prepared by women he trusts his full-time mistress Vicky Amado and her mother Norma And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup-makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters More enemies to be dealt with In the two weeks since the rebellion which the U.S hesitantly backed Mr Noriega has been at his most brutal and efficient in maintaining power Yet while the failed coup is a major U.S foreign policy embarrassment it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades America war on the dictator over the past two years following his indictment on drug charges in February is the legacy of that relationship Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama long history of conspirators and pirates For most of the past years the marriage was one of convenience In for example when Mr Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S Defense Intelligence Agency he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute according to a U.S Embassy cable from that period The woman had nearly died But U.S intelligence rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy merely filed the report away Mr Noriega tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S interests From that point on the U.S would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian misadventures The U.S has befriended and later turned against many dictators but none quite so resourceful The Mr Noriega is as smooth as the shah of Iran as well-born as Nicaragua Anastasio Somoza as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti Baby Doc Duvalier Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them And out of necessity The U.S can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power but a single error on his part could cost him his life The U.S underestimated Noriega all along says Ambler Moss a former Ambassador to Panama He has mastered the art of survival In keeping with America long history of propping up Mr Noriega recent U.S actions have extended rather than shortened his survival Mr Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in because of Panama dire economic situation says Mr Moss but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement If the U.S had sat back and done nothing he might not have made it through Mr Moss contends Perhaps most important Mr Noriega allies have intervened to encourage in some cases to demand that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne One Colombian drug boss upon hearing in that Gen Noriega was negotiating with the U.S to abandon his command for a comfortable exile sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name He is cornered says the Rev Fernando Guardia who has led Catholic Church opposition against Noriega The Americans have left him without a way out It is easy to fight when you do have any other option His chief advantage in the fight his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses Mr Noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation The U.S discovered the young Tony Noriega in late when he was in his second year at the Chorrillos Military Academy in Lima according to former U.S intelligence officials The contact occurred through Mr Noriega half-brother a Panamanian diplomat based in Peru named Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado Luis Carlos knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer relayed Tony reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and more important among his officers and instructors A spy was born It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr Noriega who was known to his friends as Cara la Pina pineapple face Born the illegitimate son of his father maid he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate He considered himself intellectually superior to his Peruvian peers many of whom were wayward sons sent by their well-off families to the highly disciplined French-modeled academy as a sort of reform school In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed French-made uniform Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life friends from the period say He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism where officers were the elite with special privileges recalls Darien Ayala a fellow student in Peru and a lifelong friend Mr Noriega relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either or intelligence officials say His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison Major Omar Torrijos gave him an intriguing assignment Mr Noriega would organize the province first intelligence service The spy network would serve two clients the Panamanian government by monitoring political opponents in the region and the U.S by tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized at United Fruit Co banana plantations in Bocas del Toros and Puerto Armuelles United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama national income Satisfying its interests was a priority for any Panamanian leader Mr Noriega initial retainer was only to a month plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX a former intelligence official says It was modest pay by American standards but a healthy boost to his small military salary which fellow officers remember as having been to monthly He did it very well recalls Boris Martinez a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr Noriega and his operation He started building the files that helped him gain power A National Guard job assumed by Capt Noriega in as chief of the transit police in David City capital of the Chiriqui Province was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses he gained a ready cache of information He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk which had been found with their mistresses This proved particularly valuable to the Panamanian government in when union leaders were planning a May Day march that the government feared could turn violent Mr Noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of Puerto Armuelles which was ruled by United Fruit Co The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control It was like a play on Broadway recalls Mr Martinez Noriega managed the whole thing He was superb Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people During his years in Chiriqui however Mr Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious Rodrigo Miranda a local lawyer and human-rights monitor recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the Zone Garrison headquarters in David where he had his offices Mr Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked laughing at them and then retreating to his office People started wondering if something was wrong with him Mr Miranda recalls But through this period so far as the U.S military was concerned Mr Noriega was a model recruit He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July according to a copy of a resume with details Mr Noriega has since classified as secret He flew to Fort Bragg N.C in September of that year for a course in psychological operations returning to the School of the Americas in Panama for a two-month course called military intelligence for officers Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty but they did so falsely He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama socalled in after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier He became Gen Torrijos inseparable shadow and the holder of all Panama secrets Mr Noriega by now a lieutenant colonel expanded his contacts to include the Cubans not to mention the Israelis the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking When U.S diplomats complained to the CIA of Col Noriega moonlighting intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans Early on in the State Department we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States recalls Francis J McNeil who as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs first ran across reports about Mr Noriega in Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans Even at this early stage drugs caused additional concerns During the Nixon administration the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the connections to arrested drug traffickers One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col Noriega one of which was assassination The head of the DEA at the time John Ingersoll scotched the assassination plan But he did fly to Panama to scold dictator Torrijos on the drug ties of Panamanian officials including Mr Noriega Mr Ingersoll later recalled that Gen Torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the U.S Everybody was afraid of him Mr Ingersoll says Mr Noriega became an even greater threat in when U.S intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S Army Military Intelligence Group The tapes included wiretaps of Gen Torrijos own phone according to American intelligence officials We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar says former CIA Director Stansfield Turner For the first time the U.S considered cutting Mr Noriega from its intelligence payroll and the deliberations were intense Mr Turner says In the world of intelligence if you want to get information you get it from seedy characters The question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you Intelligence officials to this day worry whether Mr Noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the Cubans or others Mr Turner was troubled enough to cancel the U.S contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration The U.S soon found new cause for concern gun-running Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr Somoza They included one of Mr Noriega closest friends and business partners Carlos Wittgreen And the investigators were quickly closing in on Mr Noriega himself At the time though in the U.S was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy Mr Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon Dade County and federal authorities learning that he intended to fly through Miami made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S soil It was a Friday in June The Pentagon foiled the plan According to military officers at the time word was passed to Mr Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting On Monday U.S officials received a routine unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama Due to health reasons Lt Col Noriega has elected to postpone his visit to Washington it read Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback Their original indictment against Mr Wittgreen the friend of Mr Noriega and the other four was dismissed on a technicality But now along with reindicting Mr Noriega pal they intended to charge Mr Noriega himself on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some million in arms In January Jerome Sanford as assistant U.S attorney was summoned to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms in Miami Panamanian dictator Torrijos he was told had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington Mr Sanford was told Mr Noriega friend Mr Wittgreen would be handling the shah security It would be a good idea to indict him much less Mr Noriega the prosecutor was told After prodding from Mr Sanford U.S Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington to let the indictment proceed Unfortunately Mr Eskenazi wrote in a letter those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control The letter along with a detailed prosecution memo sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death I think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would have the problems we have now Mr Sanford says If he had been found guilty we could have stopped him In August Mr Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos Soon the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses The Reagan administration also put Mr Noriega back on the U.S payroll Payments averaged nearly a year from the U.S Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA Although working for U.S intelligence Mr Noriega was hardly helping the U.S exclusively During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas He allegedly entered into Panama first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses according to Floyd Carlton a pilot who once worked for Mr Noriega and who testified before the U.S grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges But Mr Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House would act against him recalls his close ally Jose Blandon because he had an insurance policy his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua Mr Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama Mr Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua And on at least one occasion in the spring of he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua Although his help for the Contra cause was limited it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration says Sen Patrick Leahy a Vermont Democrat who then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee Noriega played U.S intelligence agencies and the U.S government like a violin he says An incident in suggested one additional means by which Mr Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington by compromising U.S officials Curtin Windsor then the ambassador to Costa Rica recalls being invited to Panama by Mr Noriega brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and quiet serious conversation on the Aswara Peninsula Mr Windsor notified Everett E Briggs the U.S ambassador to Panama of the invitation Briggs screamed Mr Windsor recalls He says Mr Briggs told him he was being set up for a honey trap in which Mr Noriega would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event with sound and video Mr Briggs on vacation after resigning his position at the National Security Council could be reached for comment As Mr Noriega political troubles grew so did his offers of assistance to the Contras an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington For instance he helped steal the May Panamanian elections for the ruling party But just one month later he also contributed to a Contra leader according to documents released for Oliver North criminal trial in Washington D.C Yet his political setbacks mounted Mr Noriega was accused of ordering in the beheading of Hugo Spadafora his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr Noriega on drug trafficking charges He then ousted President Nicholas Ardito Barletta a former World Bank official with close ties to the U.S after Mr Barletta tried to create a commission to investigate the murder And all the while Panama debt problems continued to grow Mr Noriega was growing desperate In late he made an offer he thought the U.S could refuse As recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the North trial Mr Noriega offered to assassinate the Sandinista leadership in exchange for a promise to help clean up Noriega image and a commitment to lift the U.S ban on military sales to the Panamanian Defense Forces North the document went on referring to Oliver North has told Noriega representative that U.S law forbade such actions The representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things just as Noriega had helped the U.S the previous year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal Col North conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams who relayed it to Secretary of State George Shultz Mr Noriega proposal was turned down And Mr Shultz curtly told Mr Abrams that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image The end of the marriage was at hand Within weeks the unfolding Iran-Contra scandal took away Mr Noriega insurance policy The death of CIA Director William Casey and resignation of Oliver North allowed anti-Noriega political forces to gain influence Public protests against him were triggered in June due to charges by Diaz Herrera his former chief of staff that Mr Noriega had stolen the election and had ordered the killing of Messrs Spadafora and Torrijos Few American officials were willing any longer to defend him Lawyers in Miami this time working virtually without impediment prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in February During negotiations with American officials in May over proposals to drop the U.S indictments in exchange for his resignation Mr Noriega often asked almost plaintively how the Americans whom he had helped for so many years could turn against him Now neither side the U.S nor Mr Noriega has an easy out President Bush has sworn to bring him to justice Mr Noriega believes he has any alternative but to continue clutching to power It is a knock-out battle perhaps to the death In the end is Mr Noriega the political equivalent of Frankenstein monster created by a well-intentioned but misguided foreign power Not quite Sen Leahy contends For short-term gains people were willing to put up with him That allowed him to get stronger and stronger he says I do think we created him as much as we fed him nurtured him and let him grow up to be big and strong UPJOHN Co reported that third-quarter net income rose to million or cents a share from million or cents a share a year earlier Yesterday edition provided analysts estimates for the company when actual earnings were available Industrial production declined in September reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend The Federal Reserve Board said output of the nation factories mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of in the third quarter substantially slower than the annual rate in the second quarter Capital spending and exports which have been the driving force in this expansion are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them said Robert Dederick economist for Northern Trust Co in Chicago The new reports of sluggishness which were foreshadowed by an earlier Labor Department report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by in September give the Fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates They need to do something about this said Maury Harris economist at PaineWebber Group Inc The Fed also said U.S industry operated at of capacity last month down from in August Measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures Factory output dropped its first decline since February after having been unchanged in October Factories operated at of capacity the lowest rate in more than a year and down from in September The declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods those intended to last more than three years The biggest drop was recorded by primary metals producers a category that includes the steel industry Output of business equipment was unchanged in September Production of factory equipment one indication of the strength of manufacturers investment spending fell Some economists expect further declines in investment spending Whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to soften subsequently Mr Harris said You have seen the full effect of that yet A decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto assemblies the Fed noted Analysts do expect the September surge in auto production to be repeated in the coming months Here is a summary of the Federal Reserve Board report on industrial production in September The figures are seasonally adjusted of the

decline federal researchers report The drop is particularly large for white males although black males and white and black women also show lower mortality rates A report in this week issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute also projects that overall U.S mortality rates from lung cancer the leading cause of cancer death should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate The report which comes years after the U.S Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer What this is saying is that the surgeon general message is having an impact said Melvyn Tockman an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of and a decade apart The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged to in the was per but the mortality rate of the same age group in the was a decline of Measured the same way the decline for black males was The drop in mortality rates for women was less steep for blacks and for whites The study by Susan Devesa William Blot and Joseph Fraumeni of the institute staff also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the age bracket except black men Although lung-cancer mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the for men and after the year for women Lung-cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over with sharp increases for everybody but white men But Dr Fraumeni one of the authors of the report said the declining rates we seeing for younger people we believe may be a harbinger of declining mortality in the future However he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking Even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups they ca be taken for granted the report says Smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population especially children adolescents and minorities An editorial in the NCI Journal says the report of declining lung-cancer mortality among young men and women in the U.S indicates that we finally may be winning the battle this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over billion a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking But the editorial by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior around the world the editorial says through the enactment of laws that limit advertising boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education Asked for comment Walker Merryman a vice president of the Tobacco Institute said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the U.S could violate the First Amendment protection of free speech According to the American Cancer Society smoking is responsible for of the lung-cancer cases among men and among women The NCI report attributes the differences in mortality rates by race to different smoking patterns A higher proportion of black men smoke than white men While nearly equal percentages of black and white women currently smoke in both sexes more whites have given up smoking than blacks In comparing changes in mortality rates over the past decade the NCI study looked only at blacks and whites Asians and native Americans were studied Hispanics were included with whites Recent changes in average annual age-specific lung-cancer rates per population by race and sex White Males White Females Black Males Black Females Directors elected R Marvin Womack currently vice supply

Environmentalism and New Environmentalism Journalists and Others for Saving the Planet by David Brooks editorial page Oct Old Environmentalism involved microbe hunters and sanitationists It started with improvements in hygiene made possible by affordable soap and washable underwear during the Industrial Revolution Then cast-iron sewer pipe and the flush toilet were followed by sewage and water-treatment plants toward the end of the century Medicine in the century was dedicated mostly to combating sepsis and diagnostic analysis Then the century saw the evolution of private-sector wonder drugs which promulgated medical therapy The process dramatically increased our average life expectancy eliminated much pain and constantly improved health and well-being Most public-health measures were handled at the local level New Environmentalism probably started in with the publication of Rachel Carson book Silent Spring Shortly thereafter hysterical articles began to appear predicting that advanced industrial societies would produce a blackened uninhabitable planet possibly by the turn of the century These apocalyptic predictions were advanced by such stalwarts as Paul Ehrlich Barry Commoner Rene Dubois and George Wald Writing in the Ms Carson suggested that the human race could be eliminated in years and Mr Wald suggested that life on earth might end by Mr Ehrlich predicted unprecedented famine by There were many more Thousands of chemical products were categorized as carcinogenic with recommendations that they be banned from industrial use because they produced malignant tumors in overdosed rats Unknown before were the inconclusive effects of acid rain greenhouse warming and ozone depletion all of which required burgeoning political power and gargantuan expense Meanwhile the New Environmentalists systematically opposed the methods of the Old Environmentalists Local pollution problems require cheap energy and capital for their solution But the New Environmentalists oppose private wealth creation which they claim depletes natural resources and nuclear power even though it would counteract the greenhouse effect They are in the forefront of opposing the search for new landfills and methods of incineration and even oppose new methods of research such as genetic engineering New Environmentalism is an emotional attack on proven methods of improving our quality of life and a bid for political power Let rationalize our priorities by solving pollution problems at the local level as heretofore Harry Lee Smith Alpharetta Ga Your story missed some essential points of the conference on The Global Environment Are We Overreacting First and foremost the vignettes presented by the various scientists represent a general consensus among specialists working in the respective aspects of the global environment Consider for example the greenhouse effect and climate change numerous blue-ribbon scientific committees including one from the National Academy of Science judge there is a greater than probability of a grave problem in the offing The point was to answer the question in the conference title not to try to create news stories for the event itself Nor was it intended to dictate a set of prescriptive solutions although various points were raised Each speaker was asked to address a specific topic not deliver a point of view Each scientist independently concluded society and government are underreacting when it comes to substantive policy change This leads to a very special sense of urgency If the media decide to work harder at educating the public about these complex and technical issues that hardly can be termed non-objective journalism The environment can no longer be a normal issue to be dealt with on a business-as-usual basis with comfortable increments of change We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet atmosphere This portends consequences from what we have already done that will be very destabilizing to social and economic systems The problems of the environment are so interrelated so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in less than years The consensus from the scientific community is that there is sufficient evidence to advise major policy changes No we are not overreacting Thomas E Lovejoy Assistant Secretary for External Affairs Smithsonian Institution Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc fulfilling its dismal earnings forecast for said its third-quarter net income fell on flat revenue Stung by higher marketing costs and slowing volume growth the giant Coke bottling operation said net fell to million or six cents a share from million

company spokesman said yesterday that Coca-Cola Enterprises sticks by its forecast Third-quarter revenue was flat at billion The year-ago results however included the operations of a bottling business which was sold last December Excluding that bottling business Coca-Cola Enterprises volume measured by cases of soda rose only The volume is well below the industry to growth rate of recent years but in line with other soft-drink companies for the third quarter The latest third-quarter volume also compares with a very strong growth in the year-ago quarter Coca-Cola Enterprises blamed the lower volume on its soft-drink prices which were about higher in the third quarter Consumers have been accustomed to buying soft-drinks at discounted prices for several years Coca-Cola Enterprises said it had to boost spending for trade and dealer incentives to try to keep volumes from slipping The company said it expects consumers will adjust to higher-priced soft drinks A spokesman attributed the

Hooker based in Atlanta filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection earlier this year Currently its parent company Hooker Corp of Sydney Australia is being managed by a court-appointed liquidator It is expected that GE Capital Corp a financial-services subsidiary of General Electric Co will provide much of the funding for the proposed leveraged buy-out of Merksamer based in Sacramento Calif A

chief executive of L.J Hooker Corp both declined to comment Currently Mr Merksamer owns of the company L.J Hooker acquired its interest in the firm in May At the time the Merksamer chain had stores in operation Today there are units all located in shopping malls In recent weeks Mr Merksamer has approached a number of his suppliers and asked them to provide letters of intent saying they will continue shipping merchandise to the chain following the buy-out say those familiar with the situation This year a number of retail leveraged buyouts have failed causing jitters among suppliers and Mr Merksamer apparently wanted assurances that he wo have delivery problems For the year ended June Merksamer Jewelers had million of revenue and operating profit of million The jewelery chain was put up

one-hour program will be repeated with updates throughout Saturday mornings We feel there is an opportunity for an audience that is not being served by any network so we want to take the lead says KCRA general manager John Kueneke We do need cartoons anymore They only accounted for at best of the station total revenues An NBC spokesman says the network will closely monitor the Sacramento situation and says it is the only station to defect Spokesmen for the television networks of CBS Inc and Capital Inc say there are no plans to alter the children line-up on Saturday mornings The youthful audience for Saturday programming is no longer dependent on the networks There has been a surge in syndicated children shows to independent stations as well as competition from videocassettes for kids and from cable outlets such as Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel At the same time there appears to be a market for news-oriented programming Turner Broadcasting System Inc Cable News Network has its highest ratings outside of prime time on Saturday mornings NBC has on previous occasions considered replacing cartoons with a Saturday version of Today which is produced by NBC News The

a share In the year-earlier quarter the chemicals company had net of million or cents a share Sales were million up from million a year ago Rohm Haas which plans to start operating seven new production units this year attributed the profit slide partly to higher start-up expense The company also cited the stronger dollar which cuts the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars In addition the company said it was hurt by higher than previous-year costs for raw materials though those costs have declined since the second quarter Incrementally higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs such as overtime pay For the nine months Rohm Haas net totaled million or a share down from million or a share a year ago Sales rose to

Oct article Deaths From Advanced Colon Cancer Can Be Reduced by Using Two Drugs In this article I was alleged to have said Any patient with high-risk colon cancer is really getting short shrift if he not getting this therapy I did say this and I totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs levamisole and to any of my colon-cancer patients With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon cancer by one-third but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer This is not nearly good enough I believe any physician who truly cares about cancer patients both today and tomorrow should offer the hope of something better than that My statement read verbatim from a printed text available to all reporters attending the National Cancer Institute news conference was the following New clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results These research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better I feel any patient with high-risk cancer is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity We have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead This hope however will never be realized if we use levamisole and as a stopping point Charles G Moertel M.D Mayo Clinic Rochester Minn The oil and auto industries united in their dislike of President Bush proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels announced a joint research program that could turn up a cleaner-burning gasoline Officials of the Big Three auto makers and petroleum companies said they are setting out to find the most cost-effective fuel for reducing cities air-pollution problems with no bias toward any fuel in particular However their search notably wo include natural gas or pure methanol the two front-running alternative fuels in tests to be completed by next summer Instead the tests will focus heavily on new blends of gasoline which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is choking urban areas Environmentalists criticized the program as merely a public-relations attempt to head off a White House proposal to require a million cars a year that run on cleaner-burning fuels by While major oil companies have been experimenting with cleaner-burning gasoline blends for years only Atlantic Richfield Co is now marketing a lower-emission gasoline for older cars currently running on leaded fuel The initial million research program will conduct the most extensive testing to date of reformulated gasolines said Joe Colucci head of fuels and lubricants at General Motors Corp research laboratories It will compare different blends of gasolines with three mixtures of up to methanol A second phase of research which is still being planned will test reformulated gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in or cars There was no cost estimate for the second phase The whole idea here is the automobile and oil companies have joint customers said Keith McHenry a senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp And we are looking for the most cost-effective way to clean up the air But David Hawkins an environmental lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council said the research appears merely to be a way to promote reformulated gasoline Oil and auto companies supported a move on Capitol Hill last week to gut Mr Bush plans to require auto makers to begin selling alternative-fueled cars by Instead a House subcommittee adopted a clean-fuels program that specifically mentions reformulated gasoline as an alternative The Bush administration has said it will try to resurrect its plan when the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes up a comprehensive clean-air bill William Seidman chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said Lincoln Savings Loan Association should have been seized by the government in to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as billion Mr Seidman who has been the nation top bank regulator inherited the problems of Lincoln based in Irvine Calif after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law He made his comments before House Banking Committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal-ridden industry The inquiry also will cover the actions of Charles Keating Jr who is chairman of American Continental Corp Lincoln parent and who contributed heavily to several U.S senators Mr Seidman told the committee that the Resolution Trust Corp the agency created to sell sick thrifts has studied Lincoln examination reports by former regulators dating back to My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations Mr Seidman said When Lincoln was seized by the government for example of its loans or million were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of American Continental other subsidiaries according to Mr Seidman But the government did step in until six months ago when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship the day after American Continental filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection from creditors The bankruptcy filing the government has charged in a billion civil lawsuit was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court I think it fairly clear Mr Keating knew that regulators were set to seize Lincoln Mr Seidman said Further investigation he said may result in further actions against Lincoln executives said Mr Seidman including fraud actions Mr Keating for his part has filed suit alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift Leonard Bickwit an attorney in Washington for Mr Keating declined to comment on the hearings except to say We will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time Lincoln treatment by former thrift regulators in an agency disbanded by the new law has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Mr Keating Mr Seidman said yesterday for example that Sen Dennis DeConcini D Ariz who received in contributions from Mr Keating phoned Mr Seidman to request that he push for a sale of Lincoln before it would be seized After the government lawsuit was filed against Lincoln Sen DeConcini returned the campaign contributions The senator spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of Lincoln because hundreds of Arizona jobs at Lincoln were on the line Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle D Mich has also returned contributions he received from Mr Keating a year ago Sens John Glenn D Ohio John McCain R Ariz and Alan Cranston D Calif also received substantial contributions from Mr Keating and sought to intervene on behalf of Lincoln House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez D Texas said Sen Cranston volunteered to appear before the House committee if necessary But a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators At the hearing Mr Seidman said the RTC has already pumped million into Lincoln for liquidity He also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of million in American Continental subordinated debt Some of those debtholders have filed a suit saying they believed they were buying government-insured certificates of deposit We have no plans at this time to pay off those notes he said Eastern Airlines creditors committee unhappy with the carrier plans for emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings asked its own experts to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization Representatives of the accounting firm of Ernst Young and the securities firm of Goldman Sachs Co hired by creditors to consult on Eastern financial plans told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that Eastern latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors approval According to one person present at the meeting Eastern new plan is financially overly optimistic Asked about the consultants reports an Eastern spokeswoman said we totally disagree She said they have oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off-base At a later news conference here Frank Lorenzo chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp said Eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from Chapter protection from creditors early next year operating with more service than it originally had scheduled He insisted as he has before that creditors would be paid in full under the plan Mr Lorenzo made no mention of creditors negative response to his plan We in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly Mr Lorenzo told reporters We meeting and surpassing our goals he added In July Eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for Eastern to sell billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size But after selling off pieces such as its East Coast shuttle its Philadelphia hub and various planes Eastern hit a stumbling block It could sell its South American routes one of the major assets marked for disposal Those routes valued by the creditors professionals at about million were to be sold to AMR Corp American Airlines A last-minute snag in negotiations with AMR over an unrelated lawsuit between American and another Texas Air unit caused the deal to collapse Eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization It also would leave Eastern a bigger carrier than the scaled-down one proposed under the initial plan Those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped Since then Eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions The committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze Eastern plans Both said the new plan would work Ernst Young said Eastern plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest tax and depreciation by million and that Eastern plan presented no comfort level according to a source present at yesterday session Experts from Goldman Sachs estimated Eastern would miss the same mark by million to million the source said The experts said they expected Eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated Other costs also would increase including maintenance because Eastern has an older fleet At the news conference Mr Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes presented a far rosier assessment Flanked by flight attendants pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms they said Eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats Starting next month Eastern will begin flying flights daily instead of the previously announced they said Mr Bakes declined to give out Eastern daily losses but said he did expect Eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow These accounts hold several hundred million dollars primarily from asset sales The plan Eastern hopes to pursue he said calls for Eastern to have million in cash by year end Both he and Mr Lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in January As to negotiations with creditors Mr Lorenzo said in remarks after the conference we have to see how they talks come along However he added it not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors It must be accepted by the court Under bankruptcy law Eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again If Eastern can get creditor support court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift But creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own In any event some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as forecast by Mr Lorenzo and Mr Bakes Eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March Mr Lorenzo told reporters the reorganization Eastern is pursuing would create a carrier to of the size of the pre-bankruptcy Eastern He projected it would be operating about flights a day by late spring only slightly fewer than the carrier old volume of a day HOPES OF SIMPLIFYING the corporate minimum tax before are weakening The method of calculating the tax paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way is due for a change in thanks to tax act But most experts agree that the concept that is to be introduced drags in great complexity they have been trying to head it off this year Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski backed a simplification plan in the pending House tax bill but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser Now the Senate stripped-down bill omits any proposal to deal with the corporate tax Proponents of simplification fear that the chances of getting it into the final bill are waning We hear it has low priority on the House side says Samuel Starr of Coopers Lybrand CPAs If the law is changed he says we are left staring at rules that are almost impossible to implement because there are so many complex depreciation calculations to do But Congress still could resolve the issue with other legislation this year or next Starr adds HUGO RAVAGES may be offset by immediate claims for tax refunds This law aids hurricane-wracked locales named by the president as disaster areas as well as regions so designated after other

rocky path seemingly suitable only for mountain goats After a tortuous climb she is rewarded by a picture-postcard vista a glade of golden aspens under an azure Indian-summer sky This place is miles into the back country a day-long trudge for a hiker but reached by Ms Peterson and six others in a mere two hours of pedaling fat-tired mountain bikes This says Ms Peterson is what it all about Twelve hundred miles away rangers at a Napa County Calif state park are among the many who do quite share the enthusiasm This summer speeding bikers were blamed for an accident in the Napa County park in which a horse spooked on a trail that was closed to bikers broke its leg The animal had to be destroyed the bikers fled and were never found In numerous parks near San Francisco rangers have been forced to close trails set up speed traps and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding They have even sent helicopters in pursuit of bikers after hikers and equestrians complained they were being driven from trails We were being overrun says Steve Fiala trails coordinator of the East Bay Regional Park District Two years ago the district decided to limit the bikes to fire roads in its hilly acres From about six years ago the number of mountain bikes in the U.S is expected to grow to million in At least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone The controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all-terrain bicycles is one of the most divisive storms to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory Bikers many of them ardent environmentalists proclaim their sport an efficient safe fitness-promoting way to get back to nature while asserting a right as taxpayers to pedal on public lands But the bikes burgeoning numbers safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile landscapes have prompted pleas from the Sierras to the Eastern Seaboard to ban them from the back country Key to the issue is that the bikes in skillful hands can go virtually anywhere and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror An adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance Such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to miles an hour a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians For harried public-land managers across the nation the response is increasingly to shut the gates The state of California following the lead of some regional parks recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles The move largely consigns them to roads used by motorized vehicles Most other states have enacted similar bans The bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks Even the U.S Forest Service whose lenient multiple-use philosophy permits motorized vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the U.S has begun to close some lands to the bikes including major portions of the popular Pacific Crest Trail which stretches from California to Canada Often these closings come after vigorous anti-bike lobbying by conservation organizations the politically potent Sierra Club among them Sierra has been instrumental in securing a number of the California bans It has been waging an all-out campaign to beat back a proposal pushed by Utah bike groups to allow the cycles in federally designated wilderness areas where they are now prohibited Yet Sierra hard-line stance has created something of a rift in the organization which estimates that of its members own mountain bikes Pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its anti-bike rhetoric it no longer for example lumps the bikes into the same category as motorcycles and other terrain-marring off-road vehicles But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes wo injure the environment or other users I have a mountain bike yet as a hiker I been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them says Gene Coan an official at Sierra headquarters in San Francisco echoing the concerns of many members People who feel that cyclists should be banned from an area are looking at the whole picture complains Mark Langton associate editor of Mountain and City Biking magazine in Canoga Park Calif Mr Langton is among the legions of bikers who got their first taste of wilderness as hikers or backpackers He says fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as hikers many are appalled that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy To fight back activists such as Mr Langton are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails Mr Langton group Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association mounted petition drives to help keep open certain Santa Monica Mountain trails designated for closing Biking groups in Montana Idaho Michigan and Massachusetts have won similar concessions says Tim Blumenthal mountain bike editor of Bicycling magazine These groups have been trying to improve the mountain biker image in the San Francisco-area park district where a ranger was clobbered by a cyclist this summer bikers have formed a volunteer patrol to help rangers enforce regulations and to school riders in proper trail etiquette Even staunch anti-bike Sierra members concede that of all riders cause most of the problems While some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through education and peer pressure says Jim Hasenauer a director of the International Mountain Biking Association I think we making progress Few would have foreseen such a furor when a decade ago some Marin County bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid bike using fat tires lightweight metallurgy and multi-gear technology They wanted a machine that would allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to cycles They got a machine more responsive more stable and in many ways easier to ride than the thin-tired racing bikes that then were the rage When the bikes first entered mass production in they were dismissed as a fad Last year of the million bicycles sold in the U.S were mountain bikes In California a bellwether market they accounted for more than of all bike sales The majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country City dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes Crested Butte population is a bastion of the sport By one estimate everyone here under owns at least one bike The town is home to the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and it hosts the annual Fat Tire Bike Week This summer the jamboree attracted more visitors than the busiest week of the town winter ski season David Lindsey chairman of the Fat Tire Bike celebration muses that the bike popularity may be a combination of technology and nostalgia The mountain bike feels as comfortable as the paperboy bike you had as a kid but it can do so much more he says The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Canada Province of Nova Scotia

scrambled to buy Treasury bonds for safety as stock prices plummeted and fears mounted of a replay of Friday But stocks later recovered erasing most of their early declines That cut short the rally in Treasury bonds and depressed prices moderately below late Monday levels The Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than points early in the day finished points lower at Long-term Treasury issues declined about half a point or for each face amount The stock market clearly is leading the bond markets said Jack Conlon an executive vice president at Nikko Securities People are breathing a major sigh of relief that the world did end Monday morning or yesterday Gold a closely watched barometer of investor anxiety was little changed The dollar initially fell against other major currencies on news that the U.S trade deficit surged in August to billion But the dollar later rebounded finishing slightly higher against the yen although slightly lower against the mark Federal Reserve officials sent another signal of their determination to shore up investor confidence In an apparent attempt to keep a lid on short-term interest rates the Fed once again pumped money into the banking system But the Fed move was a small gesture traders said Fed officials appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move does appear necessary several investment managers said The Fed has allowed a key short-term interest rate to decline about one-quarter percentage point The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks has been hovering around down from previously Although stocks have led bonds this week some traders predict that relationship will reverse during the next few weeks Nikko Mr Conlon fears a huge wave of Treasury borrowing early next month will drive down Treasury bond prices That coupled with poor third-quarter corporate-earnings comparisons will make trouble for the equity market for the next two to three months he says But several other traders

business improvement and refocusing program and a gain of million on the sale of a subsidiary common stock Forest-products operations strengthened in the third quarter while paper operations were dogged by higher costs soft newsprint exports and a strong Japanese yen Some competing forest-products firms have recently reported improved results due to strong pulp and paper business Weyerhaeuser pulp and paper operations were up for the nine months but full-year performance depends on the balance of operating and maintenance costs plus pricing of certain products the company said Looking ahead to the fourth quarter the company said export log and lumber markets will be weak while panel and plywood markets will be stronger Pulp and paper performance depends on cost and price variables the company said Bankers Trust New York Corp became the latest major U.S bank to increase reserves for its loans to less-developed countries making a billion third-quarter addition to its provision The bank also said it expects to report a billion loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year The new reserves bring the company provision for loans to Third World countries to billion or of Bankers Trust medium and long-term loans to these countries Step up to the plate and take the big swing Get the problem behind you and do look back said James J McDermott analyst at Keefe Bruyette Woods in approving of the move Bankers Trust has had the capacity to do this for some time the analyst said He expects Citicorp to take a similar step this year Citicorp yesterday reported a third-quarter earnings drop which analysts called a bit disappointing while Manufacturers Hanover Corp posted a million loss for the quarter after adding million to its reserve for loans to less-developed countries Three other major U.S banks posted earnings increases Wells Fargo Co of San Francisco posted a jump PNC Financial Corp the parent of Pittsburgh National Bank reported net income climbed while net for Banc One Corp of Columbus Ohio grew Citicorp Analysts were only slightly disappointed by Citicorp numbers There nothing in here that horrible and nothing to make you think they setting the world on fire said Carole Berger analyst for C.J Lawrence Morgan Grenfell Inc Earnings from the bank global consumer business grew The consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream said Mr McDermott of Keefe Bruyette Woods Corporate finance and trading results in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were relatively flat sometimes choppy the bank said and profit for the area sank The cross-border loan portfolio reflected adjustment problems and episodic payment patterns the bank said no interest payments from Argentina in the nine months and none from Brazil in the third quarter while Venezuela brought itself substantially current Overall the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to million from million a year earlier People were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision for medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries a Citicorp spokesman said But he reiterated the bank position that it is comfortable with the current level of billion covering about of the billion of such loans outstanding Ronald I Mandle analyst at Sanford C Bernstein Co called Citicorp venture-capital gains of million before taxes strong A concerning item the analyst cited was the jump in expenses which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business Citicorp spokesman said however that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth Wells Fargo Wells Fargo continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks minimizing a drop in net interest margin with third-quarter growth in high-yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages Its margin fell only seven basis points or of a percentage point from a year ago compared with a drop at Security Pacific Corp and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country As a result Wells Fargo net interest income rose million or to million for the quarter Non-interest income fell slightly to million from million while Wells Fargo continued to rigorously control non-interest expense which was almost flat at million The combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave Wells Fargo a return on average assets for the quarter about higher than Security Pacific and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the U.S Wells Fargo return on equity increased to from Wells Fargo has sold all of its non-trade loans made to less-developed countries and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans which fell from the previous quarter to million from million But the amount was still higher than the year-ago level and higher as a percentage of total loans That trend and Wells Fargo heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs are about the only worries analysts have about Wells Fargo financial picture Wells Fargo is rebuilding its loan-loss reserve which increased to million at Sept from million the previous quarter but was down from million a year ago when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans Manufacturers Hanover Manufacturers Hanover said that excluding the addition to its reserves certain tax benefits and a one-time million gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company third-quarter earnings were million The comparable year-earlier number was million a spokesman said The bank additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to billion covering of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations The net interest margin the difference between the bank cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments improved in the quarter as did certain areas of wholesale banking Fees from syndicating loans dropped to million We did take part in a lot of deals in the quarter because their credit quality was poor the spokesman said Expenses unrelated to interest rose to million PNC Financial PNC Financial cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said it continues to cut costs Net interest income in the third quarter edged up to million Trust income grew to million while service charges fees and commissions increased to million The bank total allowance for credit losses was million or of total loans Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling Congress I Party control of the government Other analysts say the Indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties Elections in this large diverse and passionate nation are always hard to predict Much depends on the opposition a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former Gandhi cabinet minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh The biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against Mr Gandhi and his five years in power five years of ups and downs promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity Yesterday four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party Mr Gandhi called elections for the lower house of Parliament on Nov and The elections will be held in different states on one of the two days The lower house five-year term expires in January the Parliament upper house is appointed The elections will be a rigorous test for the prime minister and Congress I which in various forms has ruled for of India years of independence After a landslide win in in polls held after the assassination of his mother Indira Gandhi Mr Gandhi saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride His early promises to make India a modern nation remain bogged down in bloated bureaucracy His pledge to clean up local administration and Indian politics including his own party went unfulfilled His Mr Clean image was muddied by an arms-kickback scandal which will be a major campaign issue Some analysts predict that disappointment in Mr Gandhi spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy-handed local government will crest at the polls There a wide feeling of indignation across the country says Bhabani Sen Gupta of the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi I think the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman by a corrupt revenue collector This could be a big protest against an administrative failure Even if the Congress I retains control of the government Mr Gandhi ability to push through major initiatives might be hobbled by a thinner majority Economic analysts call his trail-blazing liberalization of the Indian economy incomplete and many are hoping for major new liberalizations if he is returned firmly to power The Lok Sabha or lower house of Parliament has elected and two appointed seats In the Congress I captured seats the largest victory in the history of Indian democracy The landslide was fueled by panic that prevailed in India at the time Mrs Gandhi had been assassinated by separatist Sikhs and many Indians feared their country might split apart In the previous three general elections similar national issues clinched the vote In the Congress Party won after India victory in the Bangladesh war In Mrs Gandhi was thrown out of office after her emergency rule and in after her successors made a mess of their three years in power she was restored to office Most political analysts say that if Mr Gandhi opposition unites to field single candidates in most precincts the Congress I will lose big But if the opposition remains fractured the Congress I could win a small majority or lead a coalition government Chimanbhai Mehta a parliamentarian and former Gandhi ally predicts Congress I will win only seats a quarter of the house if the opposition fields single candidates in of the races Analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to unite and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates The arms-kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign but it unclear how it is viewed by average Indian voters In India signed a billion contract with AB Bofors a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB to purchase artillery pieces The contract was negotiated by the countries two prime ministers and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents costs In April evidence surfaced that commissions were paid The opposition charged that the money was used to bribe Indian government officials an allegation denied by Mr Gandhi administration But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence The scandal has faded and flared but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages and that has helped galvanize the opposition which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills It was the first time in years that such government bills were defeated In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone a job and even into a school the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr Gandhi whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power His term has produced no spectacular failures in politics in the economy or on the military front and has chalked up some successes But the average Indian had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt His failures in those two areas deeply and sometimes bitterly disappointed many Indians We do like the Congress I says Sooraji Jath a farmer in the western state of Gujarat The Congress government is taking the farmers bread and not giving us any support When there are well problems light problems road problems the government tells us to forget it The greatest thing going for Mr Gandhi and the Congress I Party is the poor reputation of the opposition Even if it unites for the elections its coherence is likely to be temporary When the Congress I lost the election following Mrs Gandhi hated emergency rule a similar coalition took power and then disintegrated Many Indians fear a repeat of that experience March AB Bofors a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB enters into a billion contract with India Defense Ministry to supply Bofors field howitzer guns In Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in his talks with then Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme imposed the condition that the contract have no middlemen April Swedish National Radio reports that about million nearly of the total contract was paid by Bofors as commissions to middlemen June Sweden National Audit Bureau releases its report confirming payment of about million to unidentified Indians The report says that investigations were severely hampered by lack of cooperation from Bofors Bofors says it ca disclose the names of the middlemen because it would jeopardize industrial confidentiality A portion of the report containing names of the middlemen is withheld by officials citing bank secrecy requirements Aug Prime Minister Gandhi tells the Indian Parliament neither I nor any member of my family has received any consideration in these transactions That is the truth Aug Bofors admits payments of million to middlemen April The Hindu newspaper publishes facsimiles of bank documents for foreign-exchange remittances and letters between Bofors and certain private companies related to the sale of the guns to India April A parliamentary investigative committee dominated by the Congress I Party concludes that there were no middlemen in the deal and no payment to any Indian individual or company July The comptroller and auditor-general of India reports serious lapses in the government technical and financial evaluation of the Bofors deal Sept Retired army Chief of Staff Krishnaswami Sundarji discloses in an interview that he suggested in May that the government cancel the Bofors contract According to Gen Sundarji that would have forced Bofors to disclose the names of the middlemen who received kickbacks from the company His recommendation was rejected by the government Oct The Hindu newspaper publishes the withheld portion of the Swedish National Audit Bureau report The disclosures state that commissions were paid by Bofors to an Indian agent of the arms company Parsow Partnership Ltd and Elkhorn Partners L.P said they may seek proposals from third parties relating to a sale or restructuring of CACI International Inc In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Parsow and Elkhorn which together hold of CACI common shares said they think it is in the best interest of CACI stockholders that the company be sold CACI based in Arlington Va said it had seen the filing by Parsow and Elkhorn and therefore had no comment The partnerships said they may seek board representation and they may seek the support of CACI board and other major shareholders in connection with their plans According to the filing Parsow

share Additional shares may be bought or sold in the open market in private transactions or otherwise depending on market conditions and other factors The inverse trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted yesterday as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices But bond investors continue to keep a close watch on the jittery stock market In early trading investors were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears mounted that Friday stock market debacle would be repeated But a partial recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average which had been down more than points in midmorning dashed those expectations Treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a billion offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt Bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall said Roger Early a vice president at Federated Investors Inc Pittsburgh When stocks stabilized that was a disappointment Meanwhile for the second straight day the bond market paid little attention to the Federal Reserve open market operations Fed officials injected more cash into the banking system by arranging billion of repurchase agreements during the usual pre-noon intervention period The move was meant to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence The intervention has been friendly meaning that they really did have to do it said Maria Fiorini Ramirez money-market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc She said a more aggressive move was needed The Fed also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further It already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline percentage point to about from its previous target level of about The rate which banks charge each other on overnight loans is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy It ended at about yesterday but was as low as Monday The Treasury benchmark bond fell more than point or over for each face amount while the yield moved above for the first time since Thursday Investment-grade corporate municipal and mortgage-backed securities also fell But most junk bonds closed unchanged after opening slightly higher on bargain-hunting by institutional investors Some so-called high-quality junk issues such as R.H Macy Co subordinated debentures rose The Macy issue closed up about one point at a bid price of The TVA public debt offering was its first in years Strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from billion Traders said hedging related to the TVA pricing also pressured Treasury bonds Underwriters of the TVA bonds reduced their market risk by selling Treasurys to cover at least part of their TVA holdings said James R Capra a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc The TVA bonds also served to remind the market that there will be even more new supply said Lawrence N Leuzzi a managing director at S.G Warburg Securities Co Today the Treasury will announce the size of its next two-year note sale and Resolution Funding Corp will announce details of its first bond offering Some traders estimate billion of new two-year Treasurys will be sold next week and they expect Refcorp to offer billion to billion of long-term bailout bonds Refcorp was created to help fund the thrift bailout Another agency issue came to market yesterday The Office of Finance of the Federal Home Loan Banks said it priced a four-part billion bond offering for the banks to yield from to The release of several economic reports had little impact on the market including a report that the U.S trade deficit expanded to a surprisingly wide billion in August up from a revised billion in July The August gap was expected to have expanded to billion

Corporate Other Issues Investment-grade corporate bonds ended to point lower while most junk bonds ended unchanged The TVA huge billion offering dominated attention in the new-issue market TVA offered billion of bonds priced to yield billion in notes priced to yield and billion in five-year notes priced to yield The TVA which operates one of the nation largest electric power systems is a corporation wholly owned by the U.S government Yesterday bond sale was part of a billion refinancing plan to pay off high-interest debt the TVA owes the Federal Financing Bank an arm of the Treasury Meanwhile Lockheed Corp priced a million note offering to yield Mortgage-Backed Securities The derivative mortgage-backed market revived after a brief hiatus as two new Remics totaling million were offered and talk circulated about two more issues that could be priced today The revival of the real estate mortgage investment conduit market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after two days of volatile trading Dealers noted that it difficult to structure new Remics when prices are moving widely The two Remics priced were a million Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp issue underwritten by Salomon Brothers Inc and a million Federal National Mortgage Association deal underwritten by Greenwich Capital Markets The Remic issuance supported prices of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities which held up better than Government National Mortgage Association securities during an afternoon sell-off Ginnie Mae securities for November delivery ended at down securities at down and securities at down Freddie Mac securities were at down The Ginnie Mae issue was yielding to a average life assumption as the spread above the Treasury note held at percentage points Municipals Confusion over the near-term trend for rates dominated the municipal arena as gyrations in the stock market continued to buffet bonds Long tax-exempt dollar bonds were mostly flat to point lower after

bonds ended weaker The benchmark No bond due ended on brokers screens at a price of off point to yield A House-Senate conference approved an estimated billion fiscal spending bill that provides a increase for space research and development and incorporates far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased to Separately the bill gives authority to the Bush administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low-income and moderate-income homeowners The second provision affecting so-called mortgages has met strong opposition from investment bankers represented by the Public Securities Association And a squad of influential former Senate aides employed by the Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers came to the Capitol in a vain attempt to strip the provision By an margin Senate negotiators voted to preserve the mortgage refinancing plan and despite powerful allies the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives The government currently is subsidizing an estimated loans above under the program and however disruptive to private investors the refinancing is expected to yield at least million in savings in fiscal This sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere and conservative Sen Phil Gramm cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests We are stewards here not of the mortgage companies but the taxpayers said the Texas Republican The action came as the administration won final congressional approval of million in assistance for elections scheduled in Nicaragua in February The bulk of the money would be funneled through the National Endowment for Democracy but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money true purpose and its ultimate destination The Senate had refused late Friday to invoke cloture and limit debate but behind the bipartisan leadership a solid majority took shape yesterday and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties Final approval on a roll call was never in doubt but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators including Republicans Jesse Helms and Warren Rudman and Democrats Bill Bradley and John Glenn The money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring but more than half is likely to go to the Union Nacional Opositora party Critics warned such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party standing and one irony is that under Nicaraguan law a major portion of the opposition party funds must be shared with the government Supreme Electoral Council Within the appropriations conference yesterday the billion measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science housing veterans and the environment The decision to raise the ceiling on FHA home loans still faces strong opposition in the House But it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced lawmakers to resort to various bookkeeping devices to juggle as much as billion in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget These costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal and the measure further commits Congress to a set of costly projects including the first construction funds for the space station The station is promised billion within the billion provided for research and development in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the nation high-speed aerospace plane cut by the Senate could receive as much as million in new funds or transfers Similarly the House agreed to add back million to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite being developed by General Electric Co And while setting a statutory limit of billion on the automated space probe the conference appropriated million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission a successor to the Voyager space probe Among major domestic agencies the Environmental Protection Agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by to about million An estimated billion is separately allocated for the National Science Foundation and within the Housing and Urban Development Department more than billion is provided for federally assisted housing including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families To an unusual degree the massive bill has become a vehicle for lawmakers to earmark funds for projects in home states While the practice was discouraged in the past the conference agreement is laced with veterans hospitals environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities The most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds where the two houses had separately approved a total of projects valued at million and the conference added more valued at million to ostensibly preserve balance between the House and Senate Yesterday conference agreement is the second major bill to emerge from negotiations this week as appropriators approved a fiscal transportation bill late Monday that includes a sweeping ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights An exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to Hawaii and Alaska but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate all but about flights would be covered Separately a third conference report covering an billion Treasury and Postal Service bill was sent to the Senate after passing the House on a roll call yesterday And after weeks of delay the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape Defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration standpoint And among domestic programs the most serious threat is White House opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the District of Columbia and Department of Health and Human Services The same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate and Mr Bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves Senate-passed provisions renewing U.S support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities In a sharply written letter Rep David Obey chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations warned Mr Bush that the result of his ultimatum could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere As a result of your ultimatum writes the Wisconsin Democrat I guess there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference inasmuch regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this bill Markets usually get noticed because they soar or plunge Gold which has risen or fallen significantly in quite some time yesterday achieved what may be a new level of impassiveness The most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market The settlement prices of the December February and April gold contracts were even with Monday final prices The December contract which has the greatest trading volume ended at an ounce The other months posted advances of cents to cents an ounce According to one analyst Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber New York the stock market ability on Monday to rally from last Friday decline which seemed to indicate that the economy was going to fall either took the starch out of precious metals prices and out of gold in particular Yesterday gold traded within a narrow range Gold tried to rally on Monday but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for more than a year selling by gold producers who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold December delivery gold is trading in a range of to an ounce and is having difficulty breaking out above that Mr Savaiko said Producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold Also Mr Savaiko noted stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does make gold and precious metals attractive Jeffrey Nichols president of APMS Canada Toronto precious metals advisers said there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal Investors in the U.S and Europe are comfortable with the actions of the Federal Reserve in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system which helped the stock market rebound on Monday he said There is any rush on the part of investors in the West to buy gold he said They still bear the memory of October when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell Mr Nichols said It an experience they do want to repeat At the moment gold traders are concerned about inflation he said and as for the dollar gold association with the currency has been diminishing recently so drops in the currency are having much impact on gold Dinsa Mehta chief bullion trader for Chase Manhattan Bank said There is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its flight to safety quality There is little incentive to buy gold because if the stock market goes higher it may be just a false alarm This is keeping the gold traders handcuffed The most remarkable feature about yesterday action was that the price of roughly an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold Mr Mehta said I do know what it means over the long run but for the short term it appears that gold producers are grateful for the or so that gold has risen over the past week or so he said Previously he noted gold producers tended to back off from a rising gold market letting prices rise as much as possible before selling Mr Mehta observed that the U.S merchandise trade deficit which rose sharply in August according to yesterday report has been having less and less impact on the gold market The dollar has reacted much to it so gold has either he said In other commodity markets yesterday ENERGY Crude oil prices rose slightly in lackluster activity as traders in the pits tried to assess action in the stock market Since stock market indexes plummeted last Friday participants in all markets have been wary When traders become confident that the stock market has stabilized oil prices are expected to rise as supply and demand fundamentals once again become the major consideration Crude oil for November delivery edged up by cents a barrel to a barrel Heating oil prices also rose November gasoline slipped slightly SUGAR Futures prices rose on a report that Cuba may seek to postpone some sugar shipments The March contract advanced cent a pound to cents According to an analyst Cuba ca meet all

through the same thing an SBA official says HEALTH BENEFITS remain a central lobbying effort even as Section fades The Senate after deleting Section repeal from its deficit-reduction bill still is expected to join the House in voting to kill the law which forces companies to provide comparable benefits to laborers and executives alike In lobbying on other health-coverage topics the National Federation of Independent Business will press for legislation that would give self-employed people a tax deduction for their own health plans up from currently And the group will urge that the federal government pre-empt state rules on what must be covered by employers health insurance Small-business groups also will fight the medical-leave provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves And they still oppose as too costly an employer-paid health insurance bill sponsored by Sen Edward Kennedy D Mass despite his proposal to phase in small business only gradually There is also worry that the Pepper Commission studying long-term health care will again push lawmakers toward employerpaid solutions The Section victory could have a downside by making it harder to oppose lawmakers on other health proposals With the repeal of Section we can no longer say they discouraging businesses from offering health plans says Christine Russell the Chamber of Commerce small-business advocate

Clean Air legislation worked out between environmentalists and Rep Henry Waxman D Calif The plan would increase the warranty on auto-emission systems to eight years or miles from five years or for major parts But the warranty on simpler parts would be lowered to two years or miles The garage owners say they would benefit because car owners would be less likely to go back to dealers for the simpler repairs after two years The repair shops are united however Shops represented by the Automotive Service Industry Association and the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association oppose any increase in warranty length They say the longer the warranty the longer customers will automatically return to new-car dealers which then find non-warranty work that might otherwise go to repair shops The House Energy Committee will debate the issue later this month Stan Hathcock an Atlanta garage owner who opposes a longer warranty estimates that the current plan costs him as much as a year in

in an billion leveraged buy-out in said last month that it might borrow again to help pay investors as much as million in preferred stock and debt securities When the Soviets announced their last soldier had left Afghanistan in February the voices of skepticism were all but drowned out by an international chorus of euphoria It was the Soviets Vietnam The Kabul regime would fall Millions of refugees would rush home A resistance government would walk into Kabul Those who bought that illusion are now bewildered Eight months after Gen Boris Gromov walked across the bridge into the U.S.S.R a Soviet-controlled regime remains in Kabul the refugees sit in their camps and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever But there never was a chance that the Afghan resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime quickly and easily Soviet leaders said they would support their Kabul clients by all means necessary and did The U.S said it would fully support the resistance and did With the February U.N accords relating to Afghanistan the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind including the return of Soviet ground forces while requiring the U.S and Pakistan to cut off aid The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat that U.S aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did But as soon as the accords were signed American officials sharply reduced aid In February when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout the U.S cut it further Not so the Soviets Gen Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than billion of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime Since the troop withdrawal Moscow has poured in an additional to million worth per month nearly billion since February equivalent to the total U.S aid to the resistance in nine years This includes what Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov fetchingly called new peaceful long-range weapons including more than SCUD missiles By early May Moscow had delivered for example trucks about tanks artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles Later that month it added an entire tank brigade including tanks and more than BMP state-of-the-art infantry fighting vehicles By September a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional combat vehicles more trucks and Soviet-trained Afghan troops had arrived in Kandahar In the last few weeks Moscow has added missiles the bomber version of the high-altitude aircraft which can outfly Pakistan U.S.-built and Sukhoi fighter-bombers which can outfly the Moscow claims this is all needed to protect the Kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance It is well-known that the regular Afghan infantry is filled with reluctant conscripts But this is not the entire Afghan army and it is no longer Kabul only military force Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the U.S.S.R and other East bloc nations to of these troops have returned In addition the regime has established well-paid paramilitary forces totaling more than including Soviet-trained troops of the Interior Ministry which still is directed by Soviet KGB officers Even if not all these forces are committed to the regime they are now dependent on it And thousands of Afghan children have been taken to the Soviet Union where they are hostage for the behavior of their families Since Indian military advisers have been assisting the Kabul regime In preparation for the withdrawal Moscow Kabul and New Delhi signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian Indian experts to replace some of the more visible Soviet military personnel Cuban military personnel also have been active in Afghanistan since The Soviets cut a deal with Iran a future Iranian role in Afghanistan in exchange for Iranian support of Soviet policy The deal was symbolized by the restoration of the Sultan Ali Keshtmand to the Afghan prime ministry Moreover serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces Before his assassination in President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn Rep Bill McCollum R Fla reports that these included to Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms Meanwhile the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody-minded fanatics In this they are aided by years of American European Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better moderate leaders In autumn last year for example the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates At the last minute however Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces The deal fell through and Kandahar remains a major regime base The resistance lacks not only air power armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps mine detectors or even winter gloves Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime Instead they were pressured by Pakistan ISI the channel for their support into attacking Jalalabad They took more than casualties journalists report that they faced minefields without mine detectors The wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the Kabul regime but that it continues to exist and fight at all Last summer in response to congressional criticism the State Department and the CIA said they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive For months the resistance has been defenseless against air attack Thus far there is no indication that they have been re-supplied with Stingers or other anti-aircraft weapons Indeed U.S officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves by the end of this year Moscow and Kabul must have found that information useful For a decade U.S policy has been incoherent based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf No settlement negotiated by others can force the Afghan people to give up their struggle A cutoff of U.S military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain Creation of a new realistic U.S policy is long overdue Ms Klass editor and co-author of Afghanistan The Great Game Revisited Freedom House directs the Freedom House program on Asia Nothing stirred the soul of Ronald Reagan and his disciples as much as the crusade to aid Nicaragua Contra rebels or the dream of building a space-based defense shield to knock out Soviet nuclear missiles Yet under Mr Reagan preferred successor President Bush those two cherished national-security causes are withering on the vine And surprisingly little more than a whimper of protest is being heard even though Reaganauts once breathed fire supporting the Contras and the Strategic Defense Initiative The programs have arthritis says Rep Henry Hyde a conservative Republican from Illinois Yet he asserts you look around and you say Who are the leaders Who is going to carry the water It is surprising that President Bush has led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI Though he nominally supports both programs Mr Bush has been a passionate champion of either cause as Mr Reagan was What surprising is that there is more of a conservative outcry as the Bush administration lets the programs slip down the national-priority list A combination of factors a weariness among some conservatives a decline in the perception of a Soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues seem to explain the strange tranquility Above all though conservative Republicans who have championed both the Contras and SDI are reluctant to attack a Republican president for failing to do more though that reluctance may be receding We want to complain we want to say something about it and we going to as it gets worse says Rep Dan Burton an Indiana Republican who has been a staunch Contra backer But it like kicking your father in the pants You hate to do it because he your father Mr Burton says conservatives unhappiness with Mr Bush cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in Panama will make them more willing to speak out Of course neither President Bush nor the Congress has actually abandoned the Contras or SDI Mr Bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the Contras until Nicaragua holds national elections next February But the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels And the administration deal with Congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month though the committees are likely to let aid continue until February Most analysts think there little prospect the Contras can be a significant fighting force without U.S arms and after the February election their future in any form will be murky at best Instead of focusing on the Contras Mr Bush has switched to urging members of Congress most recently in a White House meeting yesterday to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua Sandinista government The administration continues to support SDI or Star Wars and it recently lobbied to persuade the Senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program And just last week Defense Secretary Dick Cheney gave a strong speech listing compelling reasons to push ahead with SDI and saying he urge President Bush to veto a defense bill with inadequate funding for the program But the strong pitch by Mr Cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to SDI The House has already voted for a deep cut in funding and in the end the program backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year And while the defense secretary is speaking out President Bush himself has launched any high-visibility campaign to drum up support as President Reagan did The administration also acknowledges that it is pursuing Mr Reagan original vision of an impenetrable shield protecting the whole U.S but rather a more modest version More ominous to SDI supporters the Bush administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the Soviet Union that spells long-term trouble for Star Wars The Soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on space-based defenses But the Soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed strategic-arms treaty later on if the U.S does SDI testing or deployment that the Soviets think violates the existing anti-ballistic-missile treaty It will be hard down the road to persuade Congress to approve money for SDI plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty As a result Frank Gaffney a former Reagan Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy charges that the administration professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the SDI program strain credulity Still proponents may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense political tides have turned against arming the Nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on SDI particularly when the public perceives the Soviet threat is declining under Mikhail Gorbachev In fact because communism seems to be beating a global retreat some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they do have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us can not get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing says Mitchell Daniels a former Reagan White House aide who now is president of the Hudson Institute Some activists are toiling to raise the profile of the two causes But they say they ca make much headway because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide One longtime champion of these programs in Congress Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia is distracted by questions about his ethics conservatives note Other conservative champions like Wyoming Republican Sen Malcolm Wallop a longtime SDI advocate do have the clout with the Bush White House that they enjoyed with President Reagan Above all though proponents say neither the Contra nor the SDI cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support For there to be wind in the sails of any program the chief executive has to be blowing in the sails says Rep Burton All this causes Rep Hyde to muse about an alternate way to drum up more enthusiasm What I like to see if he is up to it is for Reagan to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for SDI the congressman says We sorry to report that on Monday President Bush accepted the resignation of William Allen as chairman of the U.S Civil Rights Commission Mr Allen appointed by President Reagan grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies His recent speech provocatively titled Blacks Animals Homosexuals What is a Minority caused an uproar when its title leaked out Mr Allen commissioners voted to call his unread speech thoughtless disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman Rep Don Edwards the California Democrat warned Mr Allen that the speech would be outside the scope of the commission jurisdiction Thomas Stoddard head of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund called the prospect of the speech frankly shocking We actually read the speech Mr Allen began it with a warning to his hosts a California church group that opposes rights for homosexuals He said that other participants in the conference do not believe that the rights of Americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual but that I mean to persuade you to the opposite view He recalled to the audience a strange infelicitous analogy he once heard arguing now that we have finally recognized that American blacks have rights we need to do the same for animals Mr Allen objected to this analogy because it seems to assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals as a mere project of charity of humaneness Rights on such a basis whether for blacks or homosexuals are mere indulgences he said subject to being taken back He says the title of his speech was to make his point that Americans have rights as individuals not as members of certain select groups His speech criticized the idiocy of notions of protected groups in society as opposed to individual equality or as he put it in a common destiny as Americans Instead of lobbying for special treatment Mr Allen said that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk invidious retrenchment with government complicity This hardly sounds like an anti-homosexual screed What really going on here The three most important things to understand about Mr Allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual a triple threat to the liberal establishment Mr Allen who teaches government at prestigious Harvey Mudd College in California and will remain a member of the commission has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals rights He last made waves when he dared to defend an Indian girl who had been adopted by non-Indian parents off her reservation Mr Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again which somehow elevated the vague concept of Indian rights above the rights of individual Indians There is a huge divide between Mr Allen view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups Indeed the gap is so large that Mr Allen critics refuse to engage the debate Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument Their effort to run him out of Washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement We hope the next head of the Civil Rights Commission will be as brave as Mr Allen in making the case for equality of civil rights Bearings Inc said its chairman John R Cunin will retire as an

third-quarter operating results and net income of million or cents a share after preferred-stock requirements Analysts said the numbers were better than expectations partly because of strong profit margins and a positive foreign-currency translation However they said the company flat revenue was a disappointment and an indication that sales of Polaroid new conventional film in the U.S have been sluggish Revenue in the third quarter was million almost unchanged from million a year earlier Polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of million for the third quarter more than double the year-before million Charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of million or cents a share in third quarter I somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand for Polaroid products said Michael Ellmann an analyst with Wertheim Schroder Co If you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue there is a lot here to base optimism on Alex Henderson an analyst with Prudential-Bache says Polaroid officials told him yesterday that U.S sales of the company new conventional film product introduced in the second quarter have been disappointing after a promising start Sam Yanes a Polaroid spokesman said I do know about disappointing but added that the company has been able to get the product on the shelves of some mass-merchandise discount retailers that it had hoped would be carrying the product already Mr Yanes said the film One Film is currently carried at about retail outlets including drugstores and

Polaroid closed at up Why is the stock market suddenly so volatile Yesterday the Dow Jones Industrial Average did a now familiar dance It plunged points before lunch with most of the drop occurring in minutes Then it rebounded to finish down only points And those swings paled beside Friday plunge and Monday recovery It madness that in an hour you can whack off so much value says Stanford Calderwood chairman of Trinity Investment Management Corp Boston And apparently it is here to stay Richard Bernstein senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch Co says My gut feel is that we live with those swings for a while There are many reasons for the market jumpiness new trading vehicles such as stock-index futures and options computer-driven strategies like program trading and crowd psychology But most are linked by a single theme liquidity the ability to get in and out of the market quickly Prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are employing ways to turn over shares at ever-faster rates and increasingly acting in concert Institutions are herding animals says Peter Anderson who heads the pension-fund management arm of IDS Financial Services Inc We watch the same indicators and listen to the same prognosticators Like lemmings we tend to move in the same direction at same time And that naturally exacerbates price movements Institutions who now account for most trading count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an eye-blink But when they discover that markets are always as liquid as they supposed markets jump On Monday for instance Howard Ward a principal at Scudder Stevens Clark found that you could buy blue-chips at quoted prices without paying up And when many firms had to pay up Monday sudden rally was sparked Trading in futures and options some people believe can add to volatility Investors believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks that is a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks These and other modern trading methods tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets says George Douglas first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc It the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy so that bouts of higher volatility get built into the stock market One new investment style called asset allocation shifts portfolio weightings between stocks bonds and cash when computer models say one is more attractive For instance First Quadrant Corp an asset allocator based in Morristown N.J said it quickly boosted stock positions in its aggressive accounts to from to take advantage of plunging prices Friday It added another Monday before stocks rallied When they did the firm reduced those stock holdings to about A classic example of institutions hunger for liquidity is portfolio insurance now widely discredited Before the crash an estimated billion in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique The idea was to insure the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves But in October when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets Yet even today institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets Others are doing index arbitrage a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures Unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch But institutions say Wall Street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets Brokers do deny that Wall Street traders say that with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the securities firms ca afford to take the risk of buying too much stock I think everyone a little more leery says Jack Baker head of equity trading at Shearon Lehman Hutton Inc The institutions have driven commission rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit capital says Tom Gallagher senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at Oppenheimer Co Why should I risk money for a guy for who paying me five cents a dance All you get is risk Lack of liquidity can also result from exchange reforms Many traders say that circuit breakers put in place to damp volatility after the crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged Friday The circuit breakers caused a shutdown in trading in Standard Poor index futures contract as the markets were falling With the futures-trading halt you could only sell stocks to cut exposure to the market says a money manager It was scary to people thinking that they could get their trades off It was like they put you in a room with a gorilla and told you there were three doors to exit said one Chicago-based futures trader Then they said By the way two of the doors are locked The takeover mania also adds to volatility UAL Corp is a good example Valued as a buy-out target the airline stock was trading at nearly a share When the deal ran into trouble the stock tumbled it closed at yesterday Presumably UAL is now trading closer to its value based on earnings By contrast traditional buy-and-hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves Scott Black a value-oriented money manager who heads Delphi Management Inc points out that for those who invest on fundamentals the value of a stock from day to day does change all that much Some experts say markets are as volatile as widely assumed Hans Stoll finance professor at Vanderbilt University says the current volatility in U.S markets pales in comparison to the decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced I just ca believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility he says And Robert D Arnott president of asset allocator First Quadrant notes that before Friday tailspin daily volatility on the New York Stock Exchange in recent weeks had reached historically low levels Some people tend to ignore that a move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower John J Phelan Jr chairman of the Big Board asserts that and have been two of the least volatile years in the last or years But the low average volatility Mr Phelan is talking about is any comfort in a period of rapid stock-market moves like the past week In addition Sanford Grossman a Wharton School finance professor says volatile jumps in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the voracious demands of institutions who can go out and say I have a billion dollars of stocks to sell Some people think the search for liquidity is fruitless In John Maynard Keynes wrote that of the maxims of orthodox finance none surely is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity It leads investors to focus on short-term price movements a game of musical chairs he called it rather than on long-term fundamental valuation James A White contributed to this article The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its Galileo space probe which is to be launched today Charles Redmond a NASA spokesman said the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected university centers to be infected by today Although the network is connected to the computer systems that operate either Galileo or the shuttle part of the network will carry analyses of Galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn Mr Redmond said the intruder had yet done any harm but the agency feared garbage data could be substituted for real data He estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer system The intruder among the broadest yet to hit a research network appeared to affect only Digital Equipment Corp hardware that uses Digital operating system It is unrelated to the much-publicized virus that last year infected Arpanet a much larger network used by researchers at universities laboratories and government agencies around the world In the lingo of computer security the NASA intruder is technically a computer worm Mr Redmond said A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks The Galileo worm apparently was hatched on a computer in France hooked up to NASA Space Physics Analysis Network Mr Redmond said NASA said the Galileo worm had affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject worms But Mr Redmond said the worm hit universities that had elected to make the changes Michael Alexander a senior editor at Computerworld a trade publication said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords such as ones that are the same as the user name If it finds one and gets into the system it will display a screen when a user logs on that says Worms Against Nuclear Killers You talk of times of peace for all and then prepare for war In addition Mr Alexander said the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center such as George Orwell was an optimist or Do feed the bats tonight The worm also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the user The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running If it finds one of those passwords Mr Alexander said

Activists fear that if the shuttle carrying Galileo into orbit should explode or if Galileo itself crashes into the Earth during the two times it flies close to the planet fatal levels of plutonium

the Galileo worm had nothing to do with either delay Mr Alexander of Computerworld said hackers have gone after SPAN before He said the Chaos Computer Club of West Germany once managed to invade SPAN and do such things as change the value of pi messing up some calculations It is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature and not to courts Beginning in the early century with U.S v Hudson and Goodwin the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal while well established in British law would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers That the conventional theory anyway In practice however the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur In particular a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade For example although insider trading has long been criminal it has never been statutorily defined In the Supreme Court tried to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v SEC decision which found that liability depended on whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain some personal gain and whether the tippee knew or recklessly disregarded this fact Gradually however lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point Consider the facts underlying the conviction of Robert Chestman Prior to a tender offer by for Waldbaum Inc in the founder of the Waldbaum supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery She called her daughter to take her to the bank who in turn persuaded her husband a Mr Loeb to run this errand Hearing of this information the husband discussed it with his broker Mr Chestman and Mr Chestman then bought for his own account and other clients Basically Mr Chestman was a fourth-level tippee Did Mr Loeb his tipper breach a fiduciary duty and if so to whom Did Mr Loeb seek personal gain and if so how Or did Mr Chestman only hear a market rumor which one may lawfully trade upon The line seems awfully thin for criminal-law purposes A second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by Robert Freeman formerly head of arbitrage at Goldman Sachs Co Essentially Mr Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy-out when he was told by another prominent trader Bernard Bunny Lasker that the deal was in trouble After placing orders to sell Mr Freeman called Martin Siegel an investment banker at Kidder Peabody Co who was advising on the deal to confirm these rumors Mr Siegel asked Mr Freeman who his source was and on hearing that it was Bunny Lasker responded Well your bunny has a good nose The illegal tip of the bunny good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market Had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced Was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain Did Mr Freeman have notice of this Finally was the information material Yet all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue Who is and who should be making the criminal law here It is not my contention that either Mr Chestman or Mr Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness Arguably both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky But even if they behaved recklessly reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case-by-case judicial extension of the law of insider trading Courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors After-the-fact judicial examination of an actor conduct has always been the common law method When only civil liability is involved this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization Still case-by-case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a fixation on ad hoc and usually sleazy examples When a court decides that a particular actor conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule Thus a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule For example in focusing on Mr Freeman attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal collapse one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin What if the rumor had been false Can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly improbable rumor is in fact false In the past not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts Today after Mr Freeman plea there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient In this light the comparative advantages of legislative law-making become clear Before it acts the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision not just the immediate parties before the court and the legislature can frame bright line standards that create less uncertainty than the fact-bound decisions of courts Although legislative lines can result in under-inclusion which explains why the SEC has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading judicial lawmaking inevitably creates uncertainty because of the shadowy outer edges and implications of most judicial decisions At least when the stakes are high uncertainty in turn results in overinclusion as individuals do not dare to approach an uncertain line closely The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime In the Supreme Court attempted in McNally v U.S to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues Yet late last year Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services At a stroke this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee Such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem Congress finds it is easier to pass sweepingly moralistic prohibitions which the courts must thereafter interpret than to engage in the difficult line-drawing distinctions that are inherently its responsibility We are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway Predictably when confronted with morally dubious behavior prosecutors will exploit the latitude such openended statutes give them Over the long run however sleazy cases will make bad law Mr Coffee is a professor at Columbia Law School Corning Inc posted a decline in third-quarter net income to million or cents a share from million or a share a year earlier The year-earlier figure included a one-time gain of million from the sale of Corning stakes in Japanese businesses Without the gain operating profit was million or cents a share The telecommunications specialty glass ceramic products and laboratory-services concern said the latest quarter included a tax-loss carry-forward of A year earlier net included a taxlow carry-forward Sales rose to million from million Corning chairman and chief executive officer James R Houghton said operating performance continued to be strong in the telecommunications and health and science segments But the specialty-material segment slowed somewhat and consumer products continued below expectations As for joint ventures Mr Houghton said profit was essentially flat due primarily to a slow recovery at Samsung-Corning Co in Korea following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to China Also profit was hurt by the

Investors can get slightly higher yields on deposits below than they can on deposits of and up Banks want to remain competitive said Norberto Mehl chairman of Banxquote October is a big rollover month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand among people leaving the stock market Some bankers are reporting more inquiries than usual about CDs since Friday Reports from branches are that there has

York newspapers touting Lincoln Savings Bank one-year CD Harold Jones Lincoln chief retail banking officer said there has yet been a discernible response although the ad included a coupon that could arrive later in the week Friday market rout came smack in the middle of the heaviest month for CD rollovers when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way First National Bank of Boston for example is offering certain new depositors an extra quarter of a percentage point on six-month and CDs Some banks actually boosted yields on the shortest term CDs in the latest week New York Citibank for instance increased the yield on small-denomination three-month CDs to from On average however three-month CDs at major banks are yielding a tenth of a percentage point less than they were a week ago Average yields on CDs aimed at individual investors fell less than half as much as yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday auction Six-month CDs of and less yielded an average in the week ended Tuesday down from according to Banxquote The yield on six-month T-bills fell to on Monday from the week before Meanwhile the average yield on six-month CDs of more than fell to in the latest week according to Banxquote from the week before Mr Mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large-denomination CDs but yields on CDs aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding CDs sold by major brokerage houses which like jumbo CDs tend to closely follow interest rate trends also posted larger drops in yields A six-month broker-sold CD for example was yielding an average in the latest week a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before In late April when interest rates were at their recent highs short-term CDs sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks CD yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks What happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit reported yesterday make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise any time soon said Mr Mehl of Banxquote Even before the market drop rates were down about half a percentage point said Robert J Hutchinson senior vice president for retail marketing at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co in New York That puts pressure on CD rates Conservatives have an important decision to make this fall At the recent meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund the Bush administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the IMF capital base While the U.S share of the increase probably will not reach the billion or more implicit in the IMF request for a doubling of its billion capital the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase This would be consistent with its unwavering support for the Brady Plan and exchange-rate intervention and with its financial commitment to Mexico Poland and others The IMF has several reasons for requesting the increase Its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the The size and pace of disbursements will accelerate further under the Brady Plan which promises larger and earlier disbursements to approved countries At least three other factors have encouraged the IMF to insist on increased capital First it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets for which it feels some responsibility Second the World Bank recent billion capital increase billion from the U.S has left the IMF feeling less than first fiddle among international financial institutions Third the IMF would like to meet Japan request for increased ownership currently Japan has supported a larger role for the IMF in developing-country debt issues and is an important financial resource for IMF-guided programs in developing countries While international politics may argue for the capital increase there is a clear economic case against it Opponents of the increase argue that the IMF practices central planning while supporting ineffective governments They question whether the IMF has any role in developing countries given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in balance-of-payments emergencies Opponents show that there are already more funds available than commendable reform efforts They worry that new IMF funding of developing countries will simply end up substituting IMF debt for reschedulable commercial bank debt a bad trade all around They believe microeconomics which addresses the problems of markets investment climate and management practices is the key to developing-country growth not the IMF Keynesian focus on trade deficits quarterly targets and government debt They point at the numerous developing-country governments that have inflated taxed and regulated themselves into despair under successive IMF programs Decisions on increases in the IMF capital base traditionally are made by the administration with subsequent authorization by Congress The last U.S congressional authorization in was a political donnybrook and carried a billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes The politics of the congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous authorizations Liberals may support the stabilizing quasi-governmental role of the IMF on two conditions that the administration give assurances that liberal Democrats support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns and that the legislation address with dollars social and environmental concerns Conservative Republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party popular president in an election year A U.S decision to refuse the IMF its capital increase or limit it to would bring a major change in international economic policy and could not be taken lightly Commentators would fret over the implications for the coordination process and the stability of world financial markets Because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase a scaled-down IMF mission would leave both feeling shortchanged Furthermore a U.S rejection of the capital increase and transfer of shares to Japan would give Japan an argument against future calls for economic burden-sharing On the other hand a decision to increase the IMF capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral institutions in developing countries With the increase even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate IMF-approved economic plans Upping the ante could slow economic development even further as countries delay market-opening steps in anticipation of richer multilateral support Conservatives should take a position prior to the administration year-end deadline The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase rather than its purpose If conservatives do support an increase in the IMF capital then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative Mr Malpass directs the Republican staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused of making prearranged trades with each other that allegedly cheated a

could pose a new competitive challenge to Time Warner Inc powerful Home Box Office cable giant Tele-Communications Inc agreed to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc from Viacom Inc for million The purchase comes after nearly three years of on-again off-again talks between TCI and Viacom which has also discussed the sale of an interest in Showtime with other cable operators Showtime is a distant No to Home Box Office and in May filed a billion antitrust suit against Time Warner charging the company and its HBO and American Television cable units with conspiring to monopolize the pay TV business HBO has close to million subscribers to its HBO and Cinemax networks while Showtime and its sister service The Movie Channel have only about million according to Paul Kagan Associates a Carmel Calif research firm For TCI the investment in Showtime puts it in an unusual position as the largest cable operator with control of close to million of the nation million cable subscribers TCI is HBO largest customer But TCI President John Malone has long been concerned about HBO dominance of the pay TV business and has been eager to keep Showtime as a healthy competitor It is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay-television marketplace Mr Malone said in a statement In a telephone interview Robert Thomson TCI senior vice president said Showtime suit against HBO does involve us and nothing we doing here bears any relationship to that He added We do intend to be drawn into it noting that TCI wo play any active role in the management of Showtime Linking up Showtime with the largest cable operator in the U.S could sharply boost its subscribers TCI said it may bring in other cable operators as investors a practice it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks such as The Discovery Channel Additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further Time Warner declined comment In addition to owning HBO Time Warner owns American Television Communications Inc the nation second largest cable operator after TCI Viacom also owns cable systems but it is the largest operator of such systems with less than one million subscribers The TCI investment is a big victory for Viacom chief executive officer Frank Biondi and Winston H Cox president of the Showtime unit This takes any question of Showtime viability and puts it away once and for all Mr Biondi said in a telephone interview The fight between HBO and Showtime is particularly acrimonious because Mr Biondi is the former chief executive of HBO and Mr Cox served as chief of marketing for the service They were both hired by Sumner Redstone the Boston billionaire who took control of Viacom three years ago in a leveraged buy-out Time Warner has vigorously denied all of Viacom allegations Boeing Co already struck by its Machinists union briefly called off contract talks with its engineers and labeled their demands grossly excessive Later however the company

the union to reduce its demands which included a pay hike in the first year and in the second and third years The union represents about engineers and technical workers Its contract expires Dec Meanwhile a federal mediator is scheduled to meet today with Boeing officials and representatives of striking Machinists It will take several meetings to resolve this said a spokesman for the Machinists union We do want to bring back something the members will reject Machinists already have rejected a package that would have provided a pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the

calmer reassessment of the data The U.S Commerce Department reported a billion deficit in August compared with a revised July deficit of billion Economists had expected a billion gap The August figure reflected a rise in imports and a drop in exports Marc M Goloven an economist with Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York said that while the figures appear to indicate a sadly deteriorating U.S trade performance there still enough positive news in the data to justify buying dollars He said that while the U.S trade gap with Canada has widened significantly the trade deficit with Western Europe and Japan continues to narrow And he added that manufactured goods exports are still rising The dollar near-term path remains foggy according to currencny analysts who characterize the market

Bush will veto a bill funding the Departments of Labor Education and Health and Human Services because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest the White House said Mr Bush had threatened a veto previously But he put off a firm decision while his aides and legislators searched for a compromise that would tighten requirements for such abortions in a way acceptable to the president White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said negotiations between Bush aides and lawmakers ended Monday without success Most lawmakers think it will be extremely difficult for Mr Bush opponents on the abortion issue to round up the votes needed to override the veto But there still may be prolonged debate and political maneuvering that holds up the billion funding bill for the fiscal year that began Oct Mr Bush has said he personally approves of abortions in the cases of rape incest and danger to the life of the mother But he has opposed Medicaid funding of abortions for

However that does mean they can benefit from the vaccine Its effectiveness ca be determined until a large clinical trial is undertaken by the Army in January according to Robert Redfield chief of acquired immune deficiency syndrome research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Dr Redfield report on early experiments using an AIDS vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc of West Haven Conn came at a meeting of AIDS vaccine researchers in Florida late Monday The vaccine VaxSyn has been safely given to people some of whom are experiencing substantial increases in certain antibodies The conventional wisdom used to be that you could modify the immune response of an infected individual by innoculating them with synthetic viral proteins Dr Redfield said We demonstrated that you can He said certain volunteers developed kinds of antibodies associated with early AIDS Other antibodies sparked by the preparation are of a sort rarely present in large quantities in infected or ill individuals he added One of the mysteries of AIDS remains why infected people produce large quantities of antibodies but deteriorate nonetheless Cross Trecker Corp said it reached an agreement to sell

voting member of the Federal Reserve panel that sets monetary policy Rep Hamilton said the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the Fed open market committee and the Treasury Secretary the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Office of Management and Budget The original bill was strongly opposed by the Fed and publicly criticized by friends of the Fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank independence Fed critics however hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy Rep Hamilton said the purpose of the meetings would be to improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed Fed Chairman Alan

That the view of some analysts here who argue that Britain leading maker of luxury cars still may have two U.S auto giants battling for it Yesterday Ford Motor disclosed that it has raised its holding in Jaguar to from Both Ford and its rival General Motors recently set their sights on grabbing significant minority stakes in the British company Ford latest move increases the pressure on GM to complete its current talks with Jaguar quickly GM is likely to reach the cooperative operating pact it has been seeking in about two weeks knowledgeable individuals say At that point investors may face a long bumpy ride A victor in the fight for Jaguar may not emerge until after the expiration late next year of British government takeover restrictions The curbs prevent a buyer from purchasing more than of Jaguar shares without permission This is an exceptionally odd takeover battle says London analyst Christopher Will of Shearson Lehman Hutton Jaguar American depositary receipts were up yesterday in a down market closing at Jaguar ADRs make the company one of the most widely held United Kingdom stocks in the U.S with more than one-fourth of its shares owned there Jaguar topped the

negotiations with Jaguar But yesterday announcement indicates that Ford has lost interest Both Shearson Mr Will and Stephen Reitman European auto analyst at the London brokerage firm UBS-Phillips Drew recently switched their Jaguar recommendations to hold from buy Sit tight through the coming volatility Mr Reitman suggests though he concedes that many small investors will find Jaguar zigzags too hard to swallow But a crucial point is how Ford reacts when GM the world largest auto maker firms up its proposed deal with Jaguar At the moment Ford executives will say little beyond reiterating their desire to raise Ford Jaguar stake to about GM is expected to inject roughly million million by acquiring some Jaguar shares and then win Jaguar management promise of an eventual stake Analysts believe the car makers also will create joint ventures to develop new executive models doubling Jaguar yearly output of cars Jaguar shareholders would have to bless such a far-reaching accord Ford might challenge the proposal by offering a full bid if holders and the U.K government agreed to drop the anti-takeover barrier early I think Ford is going to come out with full guns blazing Mr Reitman says Ford wants Jaguar very much U.S takeover-stock speculators who may own between and of Jaguar could give Ford enough votes to block the GM deal GM might counterbid Then Mr Will says you get a bidding war between two very rich very determined international companies He believes Jaguar share price could zoom to between and to There quite a bit of value left in the Jaguar shares here even though they have run up lately says Doug Johnson a fund manager for Seattle-based Safeco Asset Management At the moment he intends to keep the firm Jaguar shares The risk is that Jaguar share price could slump if GM agreement with Jaguar effectively locks out its U.S rival Ford appetite to attack Jaguar could gradually wane over time particularly if Saab is a reasonably attractive proposition
