d too furriers complain .
And those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages .
The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs in the U.S. .
is not as available as it was says Mr. Schreibman who is starting overseas production .
But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump fear that furs are losing part of their allure .
People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business says Stephen Sanders divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago .
You ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury insists Mr. Purnick the New York furrier .
He contends that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs .
But Mr. Rosen responds Whatever people want to buy I 'll sell .
The name of the game is to move goods .
Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection company and city officials said .
The four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities .
GTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by GTE 's private food vending contractor ARA Services Inc. was suffering from a strain of the virus officials said .
More than 700 people work in the GTE building .
The cafeteria remains closed .
Dr. Andrew McBride city health director said his staff suspects the hepatitis which can be highly contagious was spread by the cafeteria worker with the virus .
The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week Dr. McBride said .
Hepatitis A considered the least dangerous strain of the virus has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee company and city officials said .
From a public health point of view we 're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening said Dr. Frank Provato GTE 's medical director .
It 's a double-edged sword though because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis .
GTE officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company said GTE spokesman Thomas Mattausch .
The company has begun offering shots of gamma globulin which will diminish the flu-like symptoms of hepatitis A in anyone who has contracted the disease Mr. Mattausch said .
We 're strongly recommending that anyone who has eaten in the cafeteria this month have the shot Mr. Mattausch added and that means virtually everyone who works here .
I was appalled to read the misstatements of facts in your Oct. 13 editorial Colombia 's Brave Publisher .
It is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers not the left wing .
This information was gleaned from your own news stories on the region .
Past Colombian government tolerance of the narcotraficantes was due to the drug lords ' history of wiping out leftists in the hinterlands .

In the wake of a slide in sterling a tailspin in the stock market and a string of problematic economic indicators British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy .
In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy using high interest rates as the essential instrument to carry out the campaign .
Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % he pledged that rates will have to remain high for some time to come .
Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation he argued .
In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency he stated that the exchange rates will have a major role in the assessment of monetary conditions .
In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy .
He said he monitors the money-supply figures but does n't give them paramount importance as some private and government economists have suggested .
Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system .
Mr. Lawson 's speech delivered at the Lord Mayor of London 's annual dinner at Mansion House came on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy .
Two weeks ago in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15 % .
Despite the increase the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week .
It was quoted at 2.9428 marks in late New York trading Wednesday .
Leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the British war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed .
Unemployment in September dropped to 1,695,000 the lowest level since 1980 .
While lower joblessness is generally good news the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as hoped despite a doubling of interest rates over the last 16 months .
Meanwhile average earnings in Britain were up 8.75 % in August over the previous year .
Another inflationary sign came in a surge in building-society lending to a record 10.2 billion 16.22 billion last month a much higher level than economists had predicted .
In a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner Robin Leigh-Pemberton Bank of England governor conceded that demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated when the British economy was heating up last year .
He added that there 's no quick-fix solution to the economic woes and said tight monetary policy is the right approach .
Discussing the recent slide in stock prices the central bank governor stated that the markets now appear to have steadied after the nasty jolt of the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average a week ago .
Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy .
Specifically he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings .
Discussing future monetary arrangements Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System but he did n't indicate when .

C. Olivetti & Co. claiming it has won the race in Europe to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip unveiled its CP486 computer yesterday .
The product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp. 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor which works several times faster than previously available chips .
Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year .
An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine and that it should be available in Europe by December .
What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do the spokesman said .
The new chip is a very big step in computing and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product said Patricia Meagher Davis an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London .
Executives at Olivetti whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market .
Ms. Davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti 's own minicomputers but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers stockbrokers and medical doctors .
Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year she believes Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December .
We think the worst is over in the European information-technology market she said .
Depending on the type of software and peripherals used the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals a role usually filled by a minicomputer as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer .
It 's the missing link in Olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers the Olivetti spokesman said .
He added that Olivetti will continue making its LSX minicomputer line .
The machines will cost around 16,250 on average in Europe .
The Intel 486 chip can process 15 million instructions per second or MIPS while Intel 's previous 386 chip could handle only 3 to 6 MIPS .
Olivetti also plans to sell the CP486 computer in the U.S. starting next year through Olivetti USA and through its ISC\/Bunker Ramo unit which specializes in automating bank-branch networks .
Viatech Inc. said it received approval from the French government for its proposed 44.7 million acquisition of Ferembal S.A .
The approval satisfies the remaining conditions of the purchase which is expected to close within two weeks .
erembal the second-largest maker of food cans in France had 1988 sales of 150 million .
Ferembal has 930 workers at four canning manufacturing plants and one plastic container facility .
Viatech makes flexible packaging films and machinery and materials for the food and pharmaceutical industries .
Social Security benefits will rise 4.7 % next year to keep pace with inflation boosting the average monthly benefit to 566 from 541 the Department of Health and Human Services announced .
The higher payments will start with Social Security checks received on Jan. 3 1990 .
Supplemental Security Income payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7 % starting with checks received on Dec. 29 1988 increasing the maximum SSI payment to 386 from 368 a month .
The inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the Social Security trust fund will rise to 50,400 in 1990 from 48,000 this year .
As mandated by law the tax rate will rise to 7.65 % in 1990 from 7.51 % and wo n't rise any further in the future .
This means that the maximum yearly Social Security tax paid by workers and employers each will rise 250.80 next year to 3,855.60 .
Beneficiaries aged 65 through 69 will be able to earn 9,360 without losing any Social Security benefits in 1990 up from 8,880 this year .
The exempt amount for beneficiaries under 65 will rise to 6,840 from 6,480 .
The adjustments reflect the increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year .
Health-care companies should get healthier in the third quarter .
Medical-supply houses are expected to report earnings increases of about 15 % on average for the third quarter despite sales increases of less than 10 % analysts say .
To offset sluggish sales growth companies have been cutting staff mostly through attrition and slowing the growth in research and development spending .
Sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers such as hospitals to hold down prices .
Suppliers were also hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar which makes sales abroad more difficult .
In some cases competition has squeezed margins .
Becton Dickinson & Co. for example faces stiff competition from a Japanese supplier in the important syringe market .
The Franklin Lakes N.J. company is expected to report sales growth of only 5 % to 6 % but should still maintain earnings growth of 10 % says Jerry E. Fuller an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc .
Among the first of the group to post results Abbott Laboratories said third-quarter net income jumped 14 % to 196 million or 88 cents a share from 172 million or 76 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales for the company based in Abbott Park Ill. rose 8.3 % to 1.31 billion from 1.21 billion .
Baxter International Inc. yesterday reported net climbed 20 % in the third period to 102 million or 34 cents a share from 85 million or 28 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales for the Deerfield Ill. company rose 5.8 % to 1.81 billion from 1.71 billion .
But not every company expects to report increased earnings .
C.R. Bard Inc. yesterday said third-quarter net plunged 51 % to 9.9 million or 18 cents a share from 20 million or 35 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales fell 1.2 % to 190.1 million from 192.5 million .
The Murray Hill N.J. company said full-year earnings may be off 33 cents a share because the company removed a catheter from the market .
In 1988 the company earned 1.38 a share .
The Food and Drug Administration had raised questions about the device 's design .
Some analysts add that third-party pressures to reduce health costs will continue to bedevil companies ' bottom lines .
Takeover speculation which has been buoying stocks of supply houses may also ease says Peter Sidoti an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
As that wanes you 're going to see the stocks probably wane as well he says .
Hospitals companies meanwhile are reporting improved earnings .
Bolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals National Medical Enterprises Inc. Los Angeles reported net income of 50 million or 65 cents a share for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 up from 41 million or 56 cents a share a year earlier .
Humana Inc. Louisville Ky. also reported favorable results with net income of 66.7 million or 66 cents in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 up from 58.2 million or 59 cents a year earlier .
Analysts say the handful of hospital companies that are still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends .
Most important hospital admission rates are stabilizing after several years of decline .
Moreover companies have sold off many of their smaller less-profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings .
Humana 's revenues for example are being boosted by large increases in enrollments in the company 's health maintenance organizations .
Says Todd Richter an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds The shakeout in the publicly traded companies is over .
Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 396,000 during the week ended Oct. 7 from 334,000 the previous week the Labor Department said .
The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 or 2.2 % of those covered by unemployment insurance from 2,205,000 the previous week when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2 % .
Counting all state and federal benefit programs the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier .
These figures are n't seasonally adjusted .
A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states particularly North Carolina and South Carolina .
The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits the official said .
Digital Equipment Corp. reported a 32 % decline in net income on a modest revenue gain in its fiscal first quarter causing some analysts to predict weaker results ahead than they had expected .
Although the second-largest computer maker had prepared Wall Street for a poor quarter analysts said they were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders .
The Maynard Mass. company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on mid-range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes .
Net for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to 150.8 million or 1.20 a share from 223 million or 1.71 a share a year ago .
Revenue rose 6.4 % to 3.13 billion from 2.94 billion .
Digital said a shift in its product mix toward low-end products and strong growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins .
A spokesman also said margins for the company 's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector .
The lack of a strong product at the high end of Digital 's line was a significant drag on sales .
Digital hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe-class computers next Tuesday .
The new line is aimed directly at International Business Machines Corp .
Until the new mainframe products kick in there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end and that 's hurt us said Mark Steinkrauss Digital 's director of investor relations .
He said unfavorable currency translations were also a factor in the quarter .
DEC shares rose 1.375 to 89.75 apiece in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday .
But analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly 40-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength .
Some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead .
I think the next few quarters will be difficult said Steven Milunovich of First Boston .
Margins will remain under pressure and when the new mainframe does ship I 'm not sure it will be a big winner .
Mr. Milunovich said he was revising his estimate for DEC 's current year from 8.20 a share to well below 8 although he has n't settled on a final number .
One troubling aspect of DEC 's results analysts said was its performance in Europe .
DEC said its overseas business which now accounts for more than half of sales improved in the quarter .
It even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in Europe were up in double digits in foreign-currency terms .
That gain probably translated into about 5 % to 7 % in dollar terms well below recent quarters ' gains of above 20 % reckons Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds .
That was a disappointment and a sign of overall computer-market softness in Europe Mr. Stevens said .
Marc Schulman with UBS Securities in New York dropped his estimate of DEC 's full-year net to 6.80 a share from 8 .
Although overall revenues were stronger Mr. Schulman said DEC drew down its European backlog and had flat world-wide orders overall .
The bottom line is that it 's more hand to mouth than it has been before he said .
Mr. Schulman said he believes that the roll-out of DEC 's new mainframe will occur somewhat more leisurely than many of his investment colleagues expect .
He said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in December with all of the more sophisticated versions out by June .
For reasons he would n't elaborate on he said he 's sure that schedule wo n't be met meaning less profit impact from the product for DEC in the next few quarters .

Colgate Palmolive Co. reported third-quarter net income rose 27 % bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from U.S. operations .
Colgate said net income for the quarter rose to 76.7 million or 1.06 a share on sales that increased 6 % to 1.3 billion .
In the year-earlier period Colgate posted net income of 60.2 million or 88 cents a share .
Last year 's results included earnings from discontinued operations of 13.1 million or 19 cents a share .
Reuben Mark chairman and chief executive officer of Colgate said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in Latin America the Far East and Europe .
Results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. business he said .
Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal care businesses which include such well-known brands as Colgate toothpaste and Fab laundry detergent jumped more than 40 % the company said .
Mr. Mark attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities .
We 've done a lot to improve U.S. .
results and a lot more will be done Mr. Mark said .
Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company .
Colgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts .
The scope of the improvement in the U.S. business caught some analysts by surprise .
The company 's domestic business especially its household products division has performed poorly for years .
Analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales .
For the nine months net increased 14 % to 217.5 million or 3.09 a share .
Sales rose 7 % to 3.8 billion .
The company earned 191.1 million or 2.79 a share in the year-earlier period .
Colgate 's 1988 net income included 40.1 million or 59 cents a share from discontinued operations .
Colgate sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year .
Separately Colgate Wednesday finalized an agreement with MacroChem Corp. a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in Billerica Mass. to market in the U.S. four of MacroChem 's FDA-approved dental products .
The products sealants and bonding materials used by dentists all contain fluoride that is released over time .
The move is part of a drive to increase Colgate 's business with dentists a company spokeswoman said .
Terms of the agreement were n't given .
USACafes Limited Partnership said it completed the sale of its Bonanza restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of Metromedia Co. for 71 million in cash .
USACafes which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible .
The Bonanza franchise system which generates about 600 million in sales annually represented substantially all of the partnership 's assets .
The sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a Delaware court USACafes said .
The company said it believes the suit is without merit .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes will enable it to save 450 million in the next year .
AT&T also said net income rose 19 % in the third quarter .
AT&T said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments .
AT&T said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program .
AT&T said third-quarter net income grew despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets .
Net income rose to 699 million or 65 cents a share from the year-earlier 587 million or 55 cents a share .
Revenue edged up to 8.9 billion from 8.81 billion .
The latest period 's net was reduced 102 million or nine cents a share for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment .
The results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts who were encouraged by AT&T increasing its operating margin to 13 % from 11 % a year ago because of continued cost-cutting efforts .
Sales of long-distance services an extremely competitive market rose 6.4 % .
But the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products .
Under the amended pension program AT&T managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes .
Managers who retire Dec. 30 will have an additional 15 % added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65 whichever comes earlier .
An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees .
Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months .
This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth said Jack Grubman an analyst with PaineWebber Inc .
But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth .
This is a good move but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are in terms of earnings growth said Joel D. Gross an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette .
Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts it expects in the future .
AT&T said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses .
But the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire .
AT&T said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in Ing .
C. Olivetti & Co. for shares in Cie .
Industriali Riunite an Italian holding company .
For the nine months AT&T said net income was 1.99 billion or 1.85 a share up 19 % from 1.67 billion or 1.56 a share .
Revenue gained 3.1 % to 26.81 billion from 26 billion .
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange AT&T shares closed at 43.375 up 87.5 cents .
When it comes to buying and selling shares Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one .
Every dollar 's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year the firm estimates .
That makes it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
But wait a second .
Westridge Capital is an index fund the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average .
Westridge Capital 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing .
Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer such as Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index and match its performance .
Institutional investors have poured 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns .
These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few active stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers much less beat it .
And the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each 100 of assets a fraction of the cost of active managers .
That 's because computers do most of the work and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs .
But today indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one .
Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average they have developed enhanced indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points .
Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade but the index money has been just sort of sitting there says Seth M. Lynn president of Axe Core Investors Inc. an indexer based in Tarrytown N.Y .
Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money .
Among the souped-up indexing strategies Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks or just a few dozen rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies .
They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks such as smaller companies those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry state or country .
With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 .
Futures and options also make it possible to build synthetic index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market .
One reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing particularly for those plain vanilla funds that mirror the S&P 500 .
There is n't a boatload of big investors out there still waiting to get into indexing says P. James Kartalia vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. Chicago which offers both indexing and active management services .
After tripling in size in the past five years index funds now hold about 20 % of the stock owned by pension funds .
A further problem is razor-thin profits .
Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing and in some cases are just that .
To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free .
It 's like getting a free toaster when you open an account says Axe Core 's Mr. Lynn .
As a result indexers have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money .
And many have been successful as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader Westridge Capital .
Westridge Capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the S&P 500 's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage points over the past four years with the same risk level as holding the S&P 500 stocks according to James Carder the firm 's president .
Strategies vary for Westridge Capital which has 300 million under management .
The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies .
Mr. Carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines .
And in some months he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all .
By their nature our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover Mr. Carder adds .
The more turnover the better for our clients .
Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns .
J. Thomas Allen president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures .
You 're buying the S&P and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it he says .
But some indexers make little or no use of futures saying that these instruments present added risks for investors .
If the futures markets have a problem then those products could have a problem says John Zumbrunn managing director of Prudential Insurance Co. of America 's Investment Index Technologies Inc. unit .
Prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus 5\/100 of a percentage point .
An added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by Prudential .
There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds .
They include LIMITED RISK FUNDS These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains .
Here a fund may promise to pay back say 95 of every 100 invested for a year even if the market goes much lower .
The fund could invest 87 for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8 % to return the guaranteed 95 .
That leaves 13 which could be used to buy S&P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the S&P index .
MANAGER REPLICATION FUNDS Say a big investor is interested in growth stocks .
Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks the portfolio will be maintained by computer reducing both fees and in theory risk because of the large number of stocks .
We see a lot of interest in those kind of things says Frank Salerno a vice president of Bankers Trust .
People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies .
TILT FUNDS This is an index fund with a bet .
Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio .
One simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates this can avoid weak sisters but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds .
Another approach An investor with 100 million might use 75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other 25 million on a favorite group of stocks .
SPECIALIZED FUNDS Indexes can be constructed to serve social goals such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa .
Other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment .
Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System for example has about 130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either Pennsylvania-based or have 25 % of their work forces in the state .
Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month this time 4.2 % while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest .
The Big Board reported that short interest dropped to 523,920,214 shares as of Oct. 13 from 547,347,585 shares in mid-September .
Amex short interest climbed 3 % to 53,496,665 shares from 51,911,566 shares .
For the year-earlier month the Big Board reported 461,539,056 shares indicating a 13.5 % year-to-year rise while the Amex reported 36,015,194 shares a 48 % leap .
Amex short interest has been heading upward since mid-December with increases in each month since then except at mid-July .
Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender .
Short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders .
Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back .
Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging .
The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock .
The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month 's 3.38 .
The ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange 's average trading volume that would be required to convert the total short interest position .
Some analysts suggest however that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions .
Varity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares .

Your Oct. 12 editorial Pitiful Helpless Presidency .
correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3 .
You are absolutely wrong however in opining that this position is some kind of flip-flop something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls .
My position is one founded on both the facts and the law .
Although you may have forgotten public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative .
The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 9 10 and 11 1988 and again on April 4 1988 .
It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega 's criminality and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies .
Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him and to exploit the administration 's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing .
As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics but made a decision in the summer of 1986 to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled .
As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war .
This decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the United States as a hidden cost of the war .
Unfortunately this problem continued even after Gen. Noriega 's indictment .
Throughout 1988 and this year I and others in Congress have pressed the U.S. to develop a plan for pushing this narcokleptocrat out of Panama .
Regrettably two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable to develop any plan military or economic for supporting the Panamanian people in their attempts to restore democracy .
Sen. John Kerry D. Mass .
For Vietnamese these are tricky often treacherous times .
After years of hesitation economic and political reform was embraced at the end of 1986 but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action .
Vietnam is finding that turning a stagnant socialist order into a dynamic free market does n't come easy .
Here is how three Vietnamese are coping with change The Tire King Nguyen Van Chan is living proof that old ways die hard .
Mr. Chan used to be an oddity in Hanoi a private entrepreneur .
His business success made him an official target in pre-reform days .
Mr. Chan now 64 years old invented a fountain pen he and his family produced from plastic waste .
Later he marketed glue .
Both products were immensely popular .
For his troubles Mr. Chan was jailed three times between 1960 and 1974 .
Though his operation was registered and used only scrap he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials .
Once he was held for three months without being charged .
Things were supposed to change when Vietnam 's economic reforms gathered pace and for awhile they did .
After years of experimenting Mr. Chan produced a heavy-duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state-produced rival .
By 1982 he was selling thousands of tires .
Newspapers published articles about him and he was hailed as the tire king .
His efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition and attracted renewed attention from local authorities .
District police in 1983 descended on his suburban home which he and his large family used as both residence and factory and demanded proof the house and equipment were his .
He produced it .
That was the first time they lost and I won he says .
He was further questioned to determine if he was a real working man or an exploiter .
Says Mr. Chan When I showed it was from my own brain they lost for the second time .
But a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property .
Warned he was to be jailed again he fled to the countryside .
His family was given three hours to leave before the house and contents were confiscated .
With only the clothes they were wearing family members moved to a home owned by one of Mr. Chan 's sons .
After six months on the run Mr. Chan learned the order for his arrest had been canceled .
He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights .
He and his family kept afloat by repairing bicycles selling fruit and doing odd jobs .
Mr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 and became a minor celebrity again when his story was published in a weekly newspaper .
In 1988 18 months after the sixth congress formally endorsed family-run private enterprise district authorities allowed Mr. Chan to resume work .
By late last year he was invited back as the tire king to display his products at a national exhibition .
National leaders stopped by his stand to commend his achievements .
Mr. Chan now produces 1,000 bicycle and motorbike tires a month and 1,000 tins of tire-patching glue in the son 's small house .
Eighteen people pack the house 's two rooms the Chans four of their 10 children with spouses and eight of 22 grandchildren .
Most sleep on the floor .
Come daybreak eight family members and two other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street .
The primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small courtyard where an ancient press squeezes rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a bathtub filled with water .
Mr. Chan talks optimistically of expanding maybe even moving into the import-export field .
First however he has unfinished business .
When district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing they released only one of his machines .
They did n't return the rubber stocks that represent his capital .
Nor did they return his house and contents which he values at about 44,000 .
He wants to recover more than just his property though .
I want my dignity back he says .
The Editor Nguyen Ngoc seemed an obvious choice when the Vietnamese Writers Association was looking for a new editor to reform its weekly newspaper Van Nghe .
After the sixth congress journalists seized the opportunity provided by the liberalization to probe previously taboo subjects .
Mr. Ngoc 57 years old had solid reformist credentials He had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature .
Appointed editor in chief in July 1987 Mr. Ngoc rapidly turned the staid Van Nghe into Vietnam 's hottest paper .
Circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover Vietnamese society and its ills .
Readers were electrified by the paper 's audacity and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered .
One article recounted a decade-long struggle by a wounded soldier to prove officially he was alive .
Another described how tax-collection officials in Thanh Hoa province one night stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers .
The newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by Nguyen Huy Thiep a former history teacher who stirred debate over his interpretation of Vietnamese culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association .
Van Nghe quickly made influential enemies .
Those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly to the restyled paper says Lai Nguyen An a literary critic .
After months of internal rumblings Mr. Ngoc was fired last December .
His dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that continues today .
Under Mr. Ngoc Van Nghe protected the people instead of the government says Nguyen Duy a poet who is the paper 's bureau chief for southern Vietnam .
The paper reflected the truth .
For the leadership that was too painful to bear .
The Billionaire Nguyen Thi Thi is Vietnam 's entrepreneur of the 1980s .
Her challenge is to keep her fledgling empire on top in the 1990s .
Mrs. Thi did n't wait for the reforms to get her start .
She charged ahead of the government and the law to establish Hochiminh City Food Co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country .
Her success which included alleviating an urban food shortage in the early 1980s helped persuade Hanoi to take the reform path .
Her story is becoming part of local folklore .
A lifelong revolutionary with little education who fought both the French and the U.S.-backed Saigon regime she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war .
Her instincts were capitalistic despite her background .
As she rode over regulations only her friendship with party leaders including Nguyen Van Linh then Ho Chi Minh City party secretary kept her out of jail .
Following Mr. Linh 's appointment as secretary-general of the party at the sixth congress Mrs. Thi has become the darling of doi moi the Vietnamese version of perestroika .
The authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of the new way of thinking .
Foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her Vietnam 's richest woman .
Some people call me the communist billionaire she has told visitors .
Actually 67-year-old Mrs. Thi is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land .
She has indeed turned Hochiminh City Food into a budding conglomerate but the company itself remains state-owned .
She manages it with the title of general-director .
The heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities such as corn and coffee from farmers in the south paying with fertilizer farm tools and other items .
Last year Hochiminh City Food says it bought two million metric tons of unhusked rice more than 10 % of the country 's output .
The company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses .
A subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that are sold with the rice through a vast retail network .
In recent years Mrs. Thi has started to diversify the company taking a 20 % stake in newly established partly private Industrial and Commercial Bank and setting up Saigon Petro which owns and operates Vietnam 's first oil refinery .
Mrs. Thi says Hochiminh City Food last year increased pretax profit 60 % to the equivalent of about 2.7 million on sales of 150 million .
She expects both revenue and profit to gain this year .
She is almost cavalier about the possibility Vietnam 's reforms will create rivals on her home turf .
I do n't mind the competition inside the country she says .
I am only afraid that with Vietnam 's poor-quality products we ca n't compete with neighboring countries .
The earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area is n't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings officials at the two major rating agencies said .
Standard & Poor 's Corp. is reviewing debt issued by 12 California counties and there are potential isolated problems said Hyman Grossman a managing director .
The agency is preparing a report to be issued today on the earthquake 's impact on the property- and casualty-insurance industry .
The only securities so far to be singled out are those issued by Bay View Federal Savings & Loan .
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing with an eye toward a possible downgrade the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company Bay View Capital Corp .
As for property and casualty insurers Moody 's said preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers ' financial condition but it raises concerns about potentially substantial risks longer-term .
Losses from the earthquake are expected to be of similar magnitude to those of Hurricane Hugo according to Moody 's .

Western Digital Corp. reported a net loss of 2.7 million or nine cents a share for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 citing factors as varied as hurricane damage an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar .
In the year-ago period the company earned 12.9 million or 45 cents a share on sales of 247 million .
Sales for the just-ended period fell to about 225 million the maker of computer parts said .
Nonetheless Chairman Roger W. Johnson said he expects the company to be profitable in the current quarter .
We are positioned to come through he said noting that the company 's backlog was up from the previous quarter .
In its second quarter last year Western Digital earned 12.7 million or 44 cents a share on sales of 258.4 million .
Mr. Johnson said Western Digital 's plant in Puerto Rico was affected by Hurricane Hugo losing three days ' production because of the storm which wrecked much of the Caribbean island 's infrastructure .
Although the plant itself was n't damaged Mr. Johnson said millions of dollars in first-quarter revenue were lost .
The revenue will be regained in the current period he added .
There are no plans to initiate a common stock dividend Mr. Johnson said explaining that the board continues to believe shareholders are best served by reinvesting excess cash .
Mr. Johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards .
Western Digital does n't make the monitors .
An accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers ' to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further dampened reseller purchases of Western Digital 's equipment .
The other areas of the business storage and microcomputers were very good Mr. Johnson said .
He said Western Digital has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array VGA graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter EGA which has a lower resolution standard technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units .
Other makers of video controller equipment also were caught in the EGA-VGA shift he said but we were able to respond much more quickly .
Still Mr. Johnson said our stock is grossly undervalued .
He said the company has cut operating expenses by about 10 % over the last few quarters while maintaining research and development at about 8 % to 9 % of sales .
As part of its reorganization this week Western Digital has divided its business into two segments storage products including controllers and disk drives and microcomputer products which include graphics communications and peripheral control chips .
Graphics communications and peripheral control chips were combined because increasingly multiple functions are being governed by a single chip .
Storage which includes computer controllers and 3.5-inch disk drives represents nearly two-thirds of the company 's business .
Disk drives which allow a computer to access its memory generated 38 % more revenue in the most recent period compared with the fiscal first quarter a year earlier .
Computer parts are getting ever smaller Mr. Johnson said a shrinking that has propelled laptops into position as the fastest-growing segment of the computer business .
As smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry he said Western Digital is strengthening development of laptop parts .
Next year Western Digital plans to consolidate its operations from 11 buildings in Irvine into two buildings in the same city a new headquarters and a block away a modern 100 million silicon wafer fabrication plant .
The plan will help the company in its existing joint manufacturing agreement with AT&T .
About half of Western Digital 's business is overseas and Mr. Johnson expects that proportion to continue .
Plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within Europe in 1992 creates significant opportunities for the company he said particularly since Western Digital already manufactures there .
Capitalizing on that presence Western Digital is launching a major effort to develop the embryonic reseller market in Europe .
Directors of state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank 's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution .
Until now BNL 's top managers and its directors have been appointed by a Treasury decree .
But under the bank 's proposed statutes an assembly of shareholders must approve board members .
The bank 's chairman and director general who also sit on the board still would be appointed by the Treasury .
BNL which is controlled by the Italian Treasury was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq .
The ensuing scandal in which the bank 's management resigned has helped renew calls for privatization or at least an overhaul of Italy 's banking system which is about 80 % state-controlled .
In a related move the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure .
BNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals .
BNL has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange .
The shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the Atlanta scandal Consob the stock exchange regulatory body reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension .
Switzerland 's wholesale price index increased 0.3 % in September from August and was up 3.9 % from a year ago marking the first time this year that the index has fallen below 4 % on a year-to-year basis the government reported .
The government attributed the 0.3 % month-to-month rise in the index largely to higher energy prices .
In August the index was up 0.2 % from the previous month and was up 4.5 % on a year-to-year basis .
The wholesale price index based on 1963 as 100 was 180.9 in September .
