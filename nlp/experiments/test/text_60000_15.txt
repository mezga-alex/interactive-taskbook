 to 500 workers from various agencies said Robert Volland chief of the agency 's individual assistance division .
At these offices earthquake victims will be helped in filling out a one-page form that they will need to qualify for such federal assistance as home-improvement loans and to repair houses .
And federal officials are promising to move rapidly with federal highway aid to rebuild the area 's severely damaged road system .
The Federal Highway Administration has an emergency relief program to help states and local governments repair federally funded highways and bridges seriously damaged by natural disasters .
The account currently has 220 million .
And though federal law dictates that only 100 million can be disbursed from that fund in any one state per disaster administration officials expect Congress to move in to authorize spending more now in California .
To get that money states must go through an elaborate approval process but officials expect red tape to be cut this time .
Keith Mulrooney special assistant to Federal Highway Administrator Thomas Larson also said that after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in Southern California the state set tougher standards for bridges and with federal aid began a program to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake hazards .
The first phase of the program has been completed but two other phases are continuing .
The two major structures that failed Tuesday night he said were both built well before the 1971 earthquake the San Francisco Bay Bridge completed in the 1930s and the section of I-880 built in the 1950s .
The I-880 section had completed the first phase of the retrofitting .

Northrop Corp. 's third-quarter net income fell 25 % to 21.5 million or 46 cents a share while General Dynamics Corp. reported nearly flat earnings of 76.5 million or 1.83 a share .
Los Angeles-based Northrop recorded an 8.2 % decline in sales as B-2 Stealth bomber research-and-development revenue continued to ebb and high costs on some other programs cut into profit .
The aerospace concern earned 28.8 million or 61 cents a share a year earlier .
Sales in the latest period were 1.25 billion down from 1.36 billion in the 1988 quarter .
At St. Louis-based General Dynamics sales rose 10 % to 2.52 billion from 2.29 billion .
It earned 76.4 million or 1.82 a share in the 1988 quarter .
General Dynamics credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments an earnings recovery in submarine operations and higher military aircraft sales .
Northrop said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 development dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F\/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor McDonnell Douglas Corp .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Northrop shares closed at 21.125 off 25 cents .
General Dynamics closed at 54.875 up 50 cents .
Northrop which since early 1988 has declined to accept fixed-price contracts for research and development said earnings were hurt by excessive costs on a number of such contracts won years ago .
Among them were the ALQ-135 electronic countermeasures system for the F-15 fighter .
Northrop 's interest expense also soared to 35 million from 17 million a year ago .
It said debt remained at the 1.22 billion that has prevailed since early 1989 although that compared with 911 million at Sept. 30 1988 .
The backlog of undelivered orders at Northrop on Sept. 30 was 4.68 billion down from 5.16 billion a year earlier .
For the nine months Northrop reported a net loss of 46.9 million or 1 a share compared with profit of 190.3 million or 4.05 a share in 1988 .
Sales dipped 3.6 % to 3.92 billion from 4.07 billion .
At General Dynamics factors reducing earnings in the military aircraft segment included higher levels of cost-sharing in development of the Advanced Tactical Fighter and the high cost of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter .
F-16 deliveries also have fallen slightly behind schedule although a return to the previous schedule is expected in 1990 the company said .
Backlog at General Dynamics rose to 16.5 billion from 15.8 billion .
Its interest expense surged to 21.5 million from 12.4 million .
For the nine months General Dynamics earned 210.3 million or 5.03 a share up marginally from 208.8 million or 4.97 a share on a 4.9 % rise in sales to 7.41 billion from 7.06 billion .
Lotus Development Corp. reported a surprisingly strong 51 % increase in third-quarter net income on a 32 % sales gain buoyed by strong demand for a new version of its 1-2-3 computer spreadsheet .
The results topped analysts ' expectations and the earnings growth of competitors prompting traders to all but forget the product-launch delays that bogged down the company for much of the past two years .
Yesterday in heavy national over-the-counter trading Lotus shares rose to 32.50 up 1.25 apiece capping a threemonth run-up of more than 40 % .
Lotus said net rose to 23 million or 54 cents a share on sales of 153.9 million .
A year ago net was 14.3 million or 31 cents a share on sales of 116.8 million .
For the nine months net of 38.5 million or 92 cents a share trailed the year earlier 's 49.9 million or 1.08 a share .
Sales rose to 406 million from 356 million the year earlier .
In the first half Lotus struggled to keep market share with costly promotions while customers awaited the launch of 1-2-3 Release 3 the upgraded spreadsheet software .
Lotus 's results were about 10 % higher than analysts ' average expectations and compared favorably with the 36 % earnings rise reported a day earlier by rival Microsoft Corp. of Redmond Wash .
The company said results were bolstered by upgrades to Release 3 by previous customers and improved profit margins the result of manufacturing-cost controls .
Rick Sherlund a Goldman Sachs analyst said Lotus had upgrade revenue of about 22 million in the quarter twice what he had expected .
Also he estimated unit shipments of 1-2-3 in all its forms were about 315,000 up 7 % from 1988 's quarterly average .
Demand for the new version was enabling Lotus to raise prices with distributors and to hold market share against Microsoft and other competitors that tried to exploit the earlier delays in Release 3 's launch Mr. Sherlund added .
He estimated that 1-2-3 outsold Microsoft 's Excel spreadsheet by four-to-one in the quarter and held a 70 % or better share of the spreadsheet market .
Silicon Valley heaved a sigh of relief yesterday .
Though details were sketchy in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high-tech corridor along with the rest of the San Francisco Bay area a spot check of computer makers turned up little if any potentially lingering damage to facilities or fabrication equipment .
Analysts and corporate officials said they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the Valley of either hardware or software goods .
Intel Corp. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. were all up and running yesterday though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways others elected to take the day off .
These systems are more rugged than many people would believe said Thomas Kurlak who tracks the computer industry for Merrill Lynch Research .
It 's not the end of the world if you shake them up a little bit .
Other companies including International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. completely idled their operations because of Tuesday evening 's temblor which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale .
Personnel spent the morning inspecting buildings for structural weaknesses mopping up water from broken pipes and clearing ceiling tiles and other debris from factory floors .
Still many were confident that in a day or two everything should be back to normal according to a spokeswoman for the Semiconductor Industry Association based in Cupertino .
IBM for instance said it anticipates returning to a normal work schedule by the weekend at its San Jose plant which puts out disk drives for the 3090 family of mainframes .
A Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman said that while things are a big mess some 18,000 Valley employees have been called back to work today .
Apple Computer added that it was being cautiously optimistic despite not yet closely eyeballing all of its 50 buildings in the region .
Even the carefully calibrated machinery in its giant Fremont plant to the north of the Valley was believed to be undamaged .
Sun Microsystems Inc. and Tandem Computers Inc. also signaled that they should recover quickly .
Digital Equipment Corp. with major facilities in Santa Clara Cupertino Palo Alto and Mountain View said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in Maynard Mass. Tuesday night .
None sustained significant damage a spokesman said adding that the delicate manufacturing process machines were checked and were all found to be operating normally .
For many companies of course there is still a slew of nagging problems to grapple with some of which have the potential to become quite serious .
For example a spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices said the Sunnyvale chip maker is worried about blackouts .
A sudden surge or drop in electric power could ruin integrated circuits being built .
But given what might have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the microelectronics business the bulk of Valley companies seemed to be just about shouting hosannas .
Several factors apparently spared the Valley a sprawling suburban stretch from San Jose to Palo Alto from the kind of impact felt in San Francisco an hour 's drive north .
For one thing buildings there tend to be newer and thus in step with the latest safety codes .
Also the soil in the Valley is solid unlike the landfill of San Francisco 's downtown Marina District which was hit with fires and vast destruction .
In addition some microelectronics companies said they were prepared for tremulous conditions like Tuesday 's .
Their machine tools are even bolted to the shop floor .
Intel said that over the past decade it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves sensitive to the shake of an earthquake in the pipes that snake through its plants .
Like other large Valley companies Intel also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation so that a breakdown at one location should n't leave customers in a total pinch .
That 's certainly good news for such companies as Compaq Computer Corp. Houston which has only a four-day supply of microprocessors from the Valley on hand because of a just-in-time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory .
Compaq said it foresees no difficulties in obtaining parts in the immediate future .
Computer makers were scrambling to help customers recover from the disaster .
Digital Equipment has set up disaster-recovery response centers in Dallas Atlanta and Colorado Springs Colo .
These units were handling calls both from people in the San Francisco area and from computers themselves which are set to dial Digital automatically when trouble arises .
They then run remotely controlled self-diagnostic programs .
Digital also said it has dispatched teams of technicians to California .
Meanwhile several other major installations around the Valley America 's center of high-tech said they too fared as well as could be expected .
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where the Energy Department tests and conducts research on nuclear weapons had only superficial damage a spokesman said .
At Lockheed Corp. 's missiles and space systems group in Sunnyvale about 40 miles south of San Francisco workers were asked to head to work yesterday after it was realized that there were no show-stoppers in the 150-plus buildings on its one-square-mile campus .
Several engineering and research offices needed closer scrutiny to make sure they were n't in danger of crumbling but the bulk of the place is in pretty good shape an official said .
One of Lockheed 's most lucrative sectors accounting for more than half the aerospace company 's 10.59 billion in sales in 1988 the missiles and space group is the prime Pentagon contractor on the Trident II ballistic missile .
It also generates pieces of the missile shield called the Strategic Defense Initiative .
Fortunately the Hubble Space Telescope set to be launched on the shuttle next year in a search for distant solar systems and light emitted 14 billion years ago from the farthest reaches of the universe was moved from Sunnyvale to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at the beginning of October .

Michael Maynard offered the world a faster way to break eggs .
As thanks the egg industry tried to break him .
And the egg producers have done a pretty good job .
They tried to put Mr. Maynard out of business by an act of Congress .
Egg-industry lobbying helped persuade six states to ban Mr. Maynard 's automatic egg-breaking machine because of fears over salmonella .
His company Misa Manufacturing Inc. was forced to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in 1987 and has since been liquidated .
Monthly sales of his Egg King machine which he now is marketing through a new company have sunk to about half a dozen from a peak of 75 says the 46-year-old businessman .
Mr. Maynard is n't the first entrepreneur to bump up against entrenched interests .
But his case is notable both for the scale of the fight it is n't often that a congressional hearing is held to determine whether one small businessman is a threat to the republic and for what it tells about the pitfalls of marketing a new product .
Now one might ask why people who sell eggs would fight someone who is trying to make it easier to crack them .
Part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry .
Many larger egg producers are also egg processors who crack inspect and sanitize billions of eggs turning them into powdered liquified or frozen egg products .
However dozens of bakers restaurant chefs and other food preparers who flocked to Mr. Maynard 's defense say that products ranging from egg bread to eclairs lose some zip when the eggs come in 30-pound cans instead of shells .
But for companies that use hundreds of eggs a day breaking them by hand can get well out of hand .
The idea behind the Egg King is pretty simple put the eggs into a cylinder that contains perforated baskets spin them at a high speed to break the shells and strain the edible part through the baskets .
One Egg King which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide has been likened to the robot R2-D2 can crack about 20,000 eggs an hour .
Because fresh eggs are less expensive than processed ones a big egg user can recover the Egg King 's 3,390 cost in a few months says Mr. Maynard .
Such centrifugal egg breakers have been around since the 1890s .
But when Mr. Maynard came forward with his machine in the early 1970s nobody else was offering them in the U.S. .
The main reason salmonella .
Chickens carry this bacteria which can cause upset stomachs and in rare cases death among people .
Hens sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs and it can also be found on unclean shells .
Thus any machine that breaks large amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread salmonella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones .
Mr. Maynard claims this is a manageable problem .
The Egg King carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have been properly sanitized and as an added precaution to use the eggs only in products that will be cooked enough to kill bacteria .
With nearly 4,000 machines in use there have been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed Mr. Maynard boasts .
He says the handful of salmonella cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an Egg King stemmed from a failure to adequately cook the products .
But he says that 's no more a reason for banning Egg Kings than bad drivers are a reason for banning cars .
Opponents do n't buy such arguments .
Human nature being what it is people do n't always follow instructions says Jack Guzewich chief of food protection for the New York state Health Department .
Leading the assault against the Egg King has been United Egg Producers .
The Decatur Ga. trade group has issued a briefing book that claims the machine is a health hazard and that Mr. Maynard is trying to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation 's egg producers .
The UEP declines to comment but the group 's attorney Alfred Frawley says the group 's actions are motivated solely by health concerns .
An early battleground was the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Mr. Maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at egg-processing facilities regulated by the USDA 's Food Safety Inspection Service .
Unfortunately for Mr. Maynard another branch of the USDA the Agricultural Marketing Service was in charge of eggs .
After receiving complaints from egg producers this branch got the other branch to rescind its approval thus limiting the machine 's potential market to bakeries and restaurants and other establishments that are n't regulated by the USDA .
The egg producers also lobbied the Food and Drug Administration .
But the FDA in a 1985 letter to the United Egg Producers said that there was little likelihood of a health problem as long as instructions were followed .
So the producers went to Capitol Hill where a congressman from Georgia introduced a measure to ban centrifugal egg-breaking machines .
Mr. Maynard whose company at the time was based in Santa Ana Calif. enlisted his local congressman and the battle was joined .
Mr. Maynard 's forces finally defeated the measure though it took a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives to do it .
Even then opponents managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called an unscrupulous method for breaking eggs .
Foiled in their effort to get a national ban the egg producers turned their attention to the states .
So far New York New Jersey Nebraska Georgia Michigan and Minnesota have outlawed Mr. Maynard 's device citing health concerns .
An antitrust suit that Mr. Maynard 's company filed in Los Angeles federal court against the United Egg Producers and others only added to the entrepreneur 's woes .
The judge dismissed the suit and ordered Mr. Maynard 's company to pay over 100,000 in legal fees to the defendants ' lawyers .
Mr. Maynard says the ruling pushed his company into bankruptcy court .
Now he has moved to Oklahoma where costs are lower and started a new company Adsi Inc. to market his machine .
But so far the change of scenery has n't ended his string of bad breaks .
Mr. Maynard recently fell from a horse and fractured his arm .
Michelle Pfeiffer ca n't chew gum and sing at the same time .
But on the evidence of The Fabulous Baker Boys that may be the only thing she ca n't do at least when she 's acting in movies .
As the tough slinky lounge chanteuse in The Fabulous Baker Boys Ms. Pfeiffer sings for herself and more than passably well .
Her Susie Diamond handles a song the way the greats do like she 's hearing the way it should sound inside her head and she 's concentrating on matching that internal tone .
Yet her intensity stops and starts with the music .
When she is n't performing for an audience she prepares for a song by removing the wad of gum from her mouth and indicates that she 's finished by sticking the gum back in .
Like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie Ms. Pfeiffer 's Susie seems like someone you 've seen before in numerous show-biz stories even her name Susie Diamond sounds like a character Marilyn Monroe must have played .
Yet nothing about Baker Boys and certainly nothing about Ms. Pfeiffer really is like something from the video vault .
Steve Kloves the young writer and director he is n't yet 30 has only one produced picture to his credit he wrote the screenplay for Racing With the Moon a lovely coming-of-age picture set in the '40s .
Both movies are infused with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older someone who does n't dismiss dreams but who also has enough experience to see his limits .
However Mr. Kloves directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace Baker Boys is both bluesy and funny .
He 's put a fresh spin on material that could come off terribly cliched for example the way Susie wows an audience the first time she sings with the Baker Boys .
Of course it does n't hurt that Mr. Kloves has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly what they 're doing .
Much of the picture 's sensuality emerges from cinematographer Michael Ballhaus 's slyly seductive lens work .
After working for years with Werner Rainer Fassbinder the late German director and more recently with Martin Scorsese After Hours The Color of Money The Last Temptation of Christ Mr. Ballhaus has developed a distinctively fluid style .
And Dave Grusin 's witty score embraces the banal requirements of banquet-hall musicianship Feelings is a must without condescension .
Though Ms. Pfeiffer has the flashy part she gets the best comic bits and to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heels the boys are pretty great too .
What seemed like a good idea to cast the Bridges brothers Jeff and Beau as the Baker brothers actually turned out to be a good idea .
Anyone who 's tried to appear natural in front of a camera knows that it 's much more natural to end up looking like a stiff .
So it 's quite possible that the terrific play between the brothers is n't natural at all that Jeff and Beau had to work like crazy to make their brotherly love and resentment and frustration and rage seem so very real .
When the movie opens the Baker brothers are doing what they 've done for 15 years professionally and twice as long as that for themselves They 're playing proficient piano face-to-face on twin pianos .
They 're small time in the small time-hotels not the best ones and restaurants in Seattle .
Yet they do n't disparage their audiences by disparaging their act .
They wear tuxedos most nights unless circumstances a regular gig at a tropical lounge for example require them to wear special costumes like Hawaiian shirts .
Plump Beau looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face plays the older brother Frank .
Frank plans the program takes care of business and approaches the work like any other job .
He 's even able to think of a job that takes him out of the house 300 nights a week as an ordinary job .
He 's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs the audience sees only the house and only near the end of the movie .
Frank grovels a little for the bookers probably no more or less than he would have to if he worked for a big corporation .
On his off-hours he wears cardigan sweaters .
Jeff Bridges is the younger brother Jack who fancies himself the rebellious artist he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs who climbs down the fire escape .
Yet Jack 's the one who can remember every dive they ever played and when and he dutifully shows up for work night after night he consoles himself with booze and by showing up at the last minute .
Looking leaner than he has in a while the younger Mr. Bridges 's Jack is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than Frank who 's managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated .
He can live with little pleasures .
Mr. Kloves has put together some priceless moments .
These include Jennifer Tilly 's audition to be the Baker Boys ' girl singer .
Ms. Tilly of the tweety-bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster 's girlfriend on the television show Hill Street Blues .
Here she delivers especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the Candy Man which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that could n't be more perfect .
It matches her voice .
And Ms. Pfeiffer 's particular version of Making Whoopee and the way Mr. Ballhaus photographs her from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress might make you think of Marilyn Monroe if Ms. Pfeiffer had n't gone and become a star in her own right .
VIDEO TIP If you 'd like to see the first time Michelle Pfeiffer sang on screen and you have a lot of patience take a look at Grease 2 .
You 'll find her there .
Better yet check out the emergence of her comic persona in Married to the Mob Jonathan Demme 's delightful Mafia comedy .

Rep. Mary Rose Oakar D. Ohio at last week 's hearings on irregularities in programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development I do n't want to feel guilty representing my constituents .
And if I think that some people on HUD Secretary Jack Kemp 's staff are off base in terms in which they 're evaluating certain things affecting my hometown I have to tell you something I 'm not going to take it .
I think that I 'm elected to represent the people that sent me here .
And one of our charges is to be an ombudsman for our area .
And if we 're not ombudsman for our area we ought to be thrown out of office .
On the other hand if we 're asking for something unreasonable or unethical and so on then that 's a whole different story .
But if I feel that there are situations where I 'm trying to get housing for our area whatever it happens to be and I have to feel that I ca n't even ask a question I 've got to tell you I think that 's outrageous .
.
I think these regulations that would prohibit well-operated programs in areas across this country would be wrong to change .
I do n't want to see some guidelines change that 's going to inhibit my city 's opportunity to use its money .
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it fined Capcom Futures Inc. 500,000 and accepted its withdrawal from membership as part of a settlement of disciplinary actions against the firm .
Capcom Futures is a Chicago subsidiary of Capcom Financial Services Ltd. a London financial firm that was implicated last year in a scheme to launder drug money .
The case is pending .
The firm was indicted in Tampa Fla. on money-laundering charges .
In June the Chicago Board of Trade said it suspended Capcom Financial .
The Capcom Futures unit withdrew from Board of Trade membership voluntarily in August a Board of Trade spokesman said .
Capcom Futures while neither admitting nor denying the Merc charges said in a statement that the Merc charges were technical in nature and that no customers were hurt as a result of the violations cited by the Merc .
The Merc alleged that among other things from April 1987 through October 1988 Capcom Futures failed to document trades between Capcom Futures and people or entities directly or indirectly controlled by Capcom Futures shareholders .

Money-market mutual fund assets grew at nearly three times their usual rate in the latest week as investors opted for safety instead of the stock market .
Money-fund assets soared 4.5 billion in the week ended Tuesday to a record 348.4 billion according to IBC\/Donoghue 's Money Fund Report a Holliston Mass.-based newsletter .
We were expecting it following the fall of the Dow Friday said Brenda Malizia Negus editor of Money Fund Report .
It 's the proverbial flight to safety .
Despite recent declines in interest rates money funds continue to offer better yields than other comparable investments .
The average seven-day compound yield on the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC\/Donoghue 's was 8.55 % in the latest week down from 8.60 % .
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that current yields continue for a year .
Most short-term certificates of deposit are yielding about 8 % or less at major banks and the yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction fell to 7.61 % for three months and 7.82 % for six months .
Money-fund assets have been rising at an average rate of 1.6 billion a week in recent months Ms. Negus said reflecting the relatively high yields .
In the latest week funds open to institutions alone grew by 1.8 billion .
Some fund managers say inflows could increase in coming days as a result of stock selling in the wake of Friday 's 190.58 point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
If you 're selling equities you do n't start getting proceeds for five to seven days said Frank Rachwalski who manages the Kemper Money Market Fund .
Neal Litvack marketing vice president for Fidelity Investments said inflows Friday into Fidelity 's Spartan and Cash Reserves money-market funds were about twice normal levels with about half coming from equity and junk-bond funds .
Monday and Tuesday were lackluster in comparison he said .
People are n't necessarily running scared Mr. Litvack said .
They 're maintaining their attitude toward investing which has leaned toward the conservative recently .
Money-fund yields tend to lag interestrate trends as portfolio managers adjust the maturities of their investments short-term Treasury securities commercial paper and the like to capture the highest yields .
Maturities usually are shorter when rates are rising and longer when they are falling .
The average maturity of the funds tracked by IBC\/Donoghue 's remained at 38 days for the third consecutive week .
It was as short as 29 days at the start of this year when rates were marching steadily upward and hit 42 days in August .
The average seven-day simple yield of the funds fell to 8.21 % this week from 8.26 % .
The average 30-day simple yield was 8.26 % compared with 8.27 % the week before and the 30-day compound yield slid to 8.60 % from 8.61 % .
Some funds are posting yields far higher than the average .
The highest yielding taxable fund this week was Harbor Money Market Fund with a seven-day compound yield of 12.75 % .
That included capital gains that were passed along to customers .
Among the other high-yielding funds Fidelity 's Spartan Fund had a seven-day compound yield of 9.33 % in the latest week .
The seven-day compound yield of the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Fund was 9.51 % .
whose Della Femina McNamee WCRS agency created liar Joe Isuzu among others announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to Paris-based Eurocom .
The complex restructuring which was long expected transforms London-based WCRS from primarily a creator of advertising into one of Europe 's largest buyers of advertising time and space .
It also creates a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by Eurocom and headed jointly by New York ad man Jerry Della Femina and two top WCRS executives .
The merged agency 's admittedly ambitious goal to become one of the world 's 10 largest agencies while attracting more multinational clients than the agencies were able to attract alone .
WCRS 's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in Europe where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk .
For Eurocom meanwhile the move gives it a strong U.S. foothold in Della Femina and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world-wide .
It also gives the outspoken Mr. Della Femina who often generates as much publicity for himself as for his clients an international platform that he most certainly wo n't be loath to use .
According to terms WCRS will pay 2.02 billion French francs 318.6 million for the 50 % it does n't already own of Carat Holding S.A. one of Europe 's largest media buyers .
Meanwhile Eurocom which had held 20 % of WCRS 's ad unit will pay 43.5 million 68.5 million to raise its stake to 60 % .
That price also covers Eurocom raising to 60 % its 51 % stake in Europe 's Belier Group a joint venture ad agency network it owns with WCRS .
Eurocom will also have the right to buy the remaining 40 % of the merged ad agency group in six years .
The transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd. or EWDB .
The merged agency will include Della Femina McNamee based in New York Eurocom 's various agencies in France the Belier Group in Europe and WCRS 's other advertising and direct marketing operations .
Mr. Della Femina will be joint chairman with former WCRS executive Robin Wight .
Both will report to Tim Breene a former WCRS executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency .
In an interview in New York Mr. Breene fresh from a Concorde flight from Paris where executives had worked through most of the night outlined big plans for the new agency .
Our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a top-10 position by the end of three years from now .
It implies very dramatic growth he said .
He added that Eurocom and WCRS had agreed to provide a development fund of 100 million for acquisitions .
The new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in Spain while Mr. Breene said it also plans to make acquisitions in Scandinavia Germany and elsewhere .
Cracking the top 10 within three years will be difficult at best .
Della Femina had billings of just 660 million last year and ranked as the U.S. 's 24th-largest ad agency .
The merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than 2.6 billion most of that in Europe bringing it to about 14th world-wide .
To make it to top-10 status it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as Grey Advertising D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Omnicom 's DDB Needham .
The merged agency 's game plan to attract multinational packaged-goods advertisers may prove equally difficult .
When WCRS created Della Femina McNamee out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988 it said it did so in order to attract larger clients especially packaged-goods companies .
Since then Della Femina won Pan Am as an international client and also does work for a few packaged-goods clients including Dow Chemical Co. 's Saran Wrap .
But major packaged-goods players of the world such as Procter & Gamble Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever have steadfastly eluded the agency .
Three of our favorite names Mr. Della Femina calls that roster adding hopefully We 're a much more attractive agency to large multinationals today than we were yesterday .
Still the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media-buying firms that Europe has seen .
As part of the restructuring WCRS and Eurocom said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across Europe .
What 's more both Eurocom and brothers Francis and Gilbert Gross who founded Carat will acquire 14.99 % stakes in WCRS Group creating a powerful link between Eurocom and Carat .
Carat will receive its WCRS stake as part of payment for the 50 % Carat stake that WCRS is buying while Eurocom said it expects to pay about 32 million for its WCRS stake .
Mr. Della Femina says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide agency serving as a sort of creative conscience .
Louise McNamee Della Femina 's president will continue running the U.S. agency day-to-day .
They and other top executives signed long-term employment contracts and Mr. Della Femina will receive an additional multimillion-dollar sum which some industry executives pegged at about 10 million .
WCRS Group for its part will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming a holding company for a series of media-related businesses said Peter Scott the firm 's chief executive .
In addition to Carat WCRS will hold onto its public relations TV programming and other businesses .
WCRS says its debt will be cut to 24 million from 66 million as a result of the transaction .
For Carat meanwhile the alliance with Eurocom and WCRS is intended to strengthen its own push outside France .
Carat 's Gross brothers invented the idea of large-scale buying of media space .
By buying the space in bulk they obtain discounts as high as 50 % which they can pass on to customers .
They thus have won the French space-buying business of such advertising giants as Coca-Cola Co. Fiat S.p .
A. Gillette and Kodak .
But now other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media-buying groups and Carat wants to expand to the rest of Europe .
To help finance the Carat purchase WCRS said it plans an issue of Euroconvertible preferred shares once the market settles down .
But WCRS added that in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets it has arranged medium-term debt financing which would be underwritten by Samuel Montagu & Co. Ltd .
Earthquake 's Damage Tuesday 's earthquake brought the San Francisco ad scene to a screeching halt yesterday with only a few staffers showing up at their offices mainly to survey the damage or to wring their hands about imminent new-business presentations .
While no agencies reported injuries to employees the quake damaged the offices of J. Walter Thompson Chiat\/Day\/Mojo and DDB Needham among others spokesmen for those agencies said .
Staffers at Thompson whose offices are in the ultramodern Embarcadero Center watched pictures drop from the walls and then felt the skyscraper sway seven to eight feet according to a spokeswoman .
Plaster fell and windows were broken at Chiat\/Day\/Mojo a spokesman for that agency said .
Late yesterday afternoon DDB Needham executives were scrambling to figure out what to do about a new business presentation that had been scheduled for today a spokesman said .
DDB Needham 's office building may have sustained structural damage the spokesman added .
All operations have stopped he said .
A number of agencies including Thompson and Foote Cone & Belding said some employees who live outside of San Francisco fearful that they would n't be able to get home spent the night at the agency .

One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention .
The deportation of more than 315,000 men women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years .
Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century .
Today 's Turks in Bulgaria in other words deserve what is coming to them four centuries later .
As if this were n't enough the Senate Judiciary Committee is getting into the act .
On Tuesday it approved Senator Bob Dole 's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24 1990 as the National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923 suffered at the hands of the warring Ottoman Empire .
There can be no quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve .
It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey a country that has been one of America 's strongest allies in NATO .
The resolution also comes at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community .
Turkey has been fighting its past for years and thus far has been only partially successful .
Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people .
Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis .
Mr. Dole 's odd effort notwithstanding most of Turkey 's political problems lie with the Europeans .
Part of the problem some Europeans have with Turkey seems to stem from its location Turkey is n't really part of Europe .
Why they wonder should it belong to the EC .
Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people Turkey we are told is not a Christian nation its people simply wo n't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition .
It 's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire comes to the fore .
No one has to accept the sins of the Ottoman Empire to reject that argument .
Turkey in any event is long past it .
The country has in recent years accepted more than 500,000 refugees from at least four bordering nations .
Kurds suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of Syria Iran and Iraq have inundated eastern Turkey .
Now it is their fellow Turks arriving as refugees from Bulgaria .
The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently .
Surely the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten .
But what the Senate Judiciary Committee has done in supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories .
Congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists .
Bulgaria 's government has been behaving beyond the pale for months and the U.S. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past .
Many in Washington say President Bush will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs .
We have a better idea Dismantle HUD to pay for the war on drugs .
Housing and Urban Development 's budget is 17 billion .
From what we and the nation have been reading the money is n't being spent very well .
The single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods .
If that takes money take it away from this discredited federal department .
But of course the Democrats pillorying HUD in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind .
Instead they 're scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the HUD scandal .
This month HUD Secretary Jack Kemp unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at HUD .
No doubt many of his ideas are worthy but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently .
Congress is unlikely to go even that far .
Last week Secretary Kemp ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from House Banking Committee members .
They were appalled for instance that he wanted to target more of the 3 billion Community Development Block Grant CDBG program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious discretionary funds that have allowed HUD officials to steer contracts to political cronies .
These development grants mainly enrich developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking garages .
They also give those in Congress political credit for bringing home the pork and so they are popular with such Members as Mary Rose Oakar .
Rep. Oakar a Democrat from Cleveland wants a 6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .
She says it 'd create 600 jobs and bring Cleveland tourist revenue .
HUD says the project does n't qualify and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money .
At the hearing Rep. Oakar started wailing about phoney baloney regulations that would stand between her and housing for downtown Cleveland .
Rep. Chalmers Wylie an Ohio Republican rallied to the cause I think the gentlelady is making an important statement .
The implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there 's something wrong I think is most unfortunate .
We 're sure some theologian can explain the difference between what the Republican consultants have been doing with HUD and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want to do with HUD .
Our view is that given Congress 's attitude toward HUD the place probably is beyond reform .
For more than 50 years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities .
In the process HUD has wasted untold billions created slums and invited corruption .
Much of HUD 's spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class .
That includes the CDBG funds and the Federal Housing Administration which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be 4 billion in the hole .
Selling the FHA 's loan portfolio to the highest bidder would save the taxpayers untold billions in future losses .
Some HUD money actually does trickle down to the poor and zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units .
The rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the neighbhorhoods .
Rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones .
Even suburban Prince George 's County Md. reported last week there have been a record 96 killings there this year most of them drug-related .
Innocent bystanders often are the victims .
A man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a Miami drug battle .
A three-year-old Brooklyn boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer .
Decent life in the inner cities wo n't be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the drug gangs .
Until then the billions HUD spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted .
It 's still unclear whether Secretary Kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at HUD or just tighten a few screws here and there .
No doubt he believes the place can be salvaged .
Having seen the hypocrisy with which Congress has addressed the HUD scandals we disagree .
It 's time to scrap the politically infested spending machine HUD has become and channel the resources into the drug war .
