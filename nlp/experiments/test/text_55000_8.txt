Row 21 of Section 9 of the Upper Reserved at Candlestick Park is a lofty perch only a few steps from the very top of the stands .
From my orange seat I looked over the first-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the World Series .
It was five in the afternoon but that was Pacific time .
Back in New York the work day was already over so I did n't have to feel guilty .
Even still I did feel self-indulgent and I could n't help remembering my father 's contempt for a rich medical colleague who would go to watch the Tigers on summer afternoons .
This ballpark the Stick was not a classic baseball stadium too symmetrical too much bald concrete .
And it did n't have the crowded wild intimacy of Yankee Stadium .
But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me liked it that they 'd brought their children found it charming that true citizens of the state of the future they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event .
Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history .
The broadcasters were after all documenting the game ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick .
Why not watch or hear your experience historicized while you were living it .
The day was saturated with the weight of its own impending history .
Long lines of people waited to buy special souvenir World Series postcards with official postmarks .
Thousands of us had paid 5 for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on Series trivia its historical photographs of great moments in Series past and its instructions in English and Spanish for filling in the scorecard .
Pitcher = lanzador .
Homerun = jonron .
Players ran out on the field way below and the stands began to reverberate .
It must be a local custom I thought stamping feet to welcome the team .
But then the noise turned into a roar .
And no one was shouting .
No one around me was saying anything .
Because we all were busy riding a wave .
Sixty thousand surfers atop a concrete wall waiting for the wipeout .
Only at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what was going on .
Then I remembered the quake of '71 which I experienced in Santa Barbara in a second-story motel room .
When the swaying of the building woke me up I reasoned that a I was in Southern California b the bed was moving c it must be a Magic Fingers bed that had short-circuited .
Then I noticed the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what had happened .
What should I do .
Get out of the possibly collapsing building to the parking lot .
But the lot might split into crevasses so I had better stand on my car which probably was wider than the average crevasse .
Fortunately the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood .
At the Stick while the world shook I thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different .
If I survived I would have achieved every journalist 's highest wish .
I was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment .
What was my angle .
How would I file .
All these thoughts raced through my head in the 15 seconds of the earthquake 's actual duration .
The rest is of course history .
The Stick did n't fall .
The real tragedies occurred elsewhere as we soon found out .
But for a few minutes there relief abounded .
A young mother found her boy who had been out buying a hotdog .
The wall behind me was slightly deformed but the center had held .
And most of us waited for a while for the game to start .
Then we began to file out to wait safely on terra firma for the opening pitch .
It was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the Stick that I really understood the point of all those Walkmen and Watchmen .
The crowd moved in clumps clumps magnetized around an electronic nucleus .
In this way while the Stick itself was blacked out we kept up to date on events .
Within 15 minutes of the quake itself I was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the Bay Bridge .
Increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before I got to my car .
And by then expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the gridlocked parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black plume of smoke we saw on the northern horizon .
Darkness fell .
But the broadcasts continued through the blacked-out night with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in Oakland and firefighting in the Marina district .
By then our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of listeners and viewers .
Everyone at the Stick that day had started out as a spectator and ended up as a participant .
In fact the entire population of the Bay Area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience .
The reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters .
The outstanding example of this was the motorist on the Bay Bridge who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway .
The tape was on tv before the night was out .
Marshall McLuhan you should have been there at that hour .
Investors who received Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions .
The first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank except for the page numbers .
Rather than printing devils Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market .
The plunge made Shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date .
In fact last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week .
Shearson a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co. did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so We decided to kill our strategy pieces says Jack Rivkin the head of Shearson 's research department .
The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary and that 's why it purged its pages .
Investors recalled that Shearson last week had been advising that the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance .
Many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views .
But Mr. Rivkin insists that the 10 pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish .
Instead he says they were cautious and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver on Monday .
As Mr. Rivkin explains it We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in Europe and concerns about the LBO market .
And by late Friday afternoon actually after the close we decided that was the wrong tone to take .
With the market down we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening .
Both before and after the Friday plunge Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65 % stocks 20 % bonds and 15 % cash .
Sheldon B. Lubar chairman of Lubar & Co. and John L. Murray chairman of Universal Foods Corp. were elected to the board of this engine maker .

China 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall .
In a report on China 's foundering economy the official State Statistical Bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9 % from a year earlier the lowest growth rate in a decade for September .
Retail sales are plummeting while consumer prices still are rising .
Chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation low growth and high inflation .
The economy is crashing hard says an Asian economist in Beijing .
The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected .
A lengthy recession if it materializes would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers .
Experts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit .
Unless the government suddenly reverses course wages for most workers wo n't keep pace with inflation creating a potential source of urban unrest .
The economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in September 1988 to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation .
Industrial output surged 21 % in 1988 while inflation peaked last February at nearly 30 % .
The slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw-materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week .
In Western market-driven countries recessions often have a bright side prodding the economy to greater efficiency .
In China however there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state .
Instead China is likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run enterprises which ate up 18 billion in bailouts last year .
Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt .
Rather the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private township enterprises which have fallen into disfavor as China 's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership .
When the going gets rough China penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent says a Western economist .
Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major Communist Party plenum for sometime in the next few weeks .
The meeting is expected to call for heightened austerity for two years .
But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy .
Some analysts believe China soon will begin relaxing economic controls particularly by loosening credit .
That would benefit Chinese enterprises as well as Sino-foreign joint ventures both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital .
A dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens if unchecked to bring the economy to a collapse .
One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of People 's Bank of China the central bank to allocate 5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest the official China Daily reported .
But while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation .
The cycle has been repeated several times since China began reforming its planned economy in 1979 .
And because China 's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy it is likely to continue analysts say .
The statistical bureau 's report cited in China Daily notes that industrial output in September totaled 29.4 billion a rise of just 0.9 % from a year earlier .
Output declined in several provinces including Jiangsu and Zhejiang two key coastal areas and Sichuan the nation 's agricultural breadbasket .
Production in Shanghai China 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government fell 1.8 % for the month .
Nationwide output of light industrial products declined 1.8 % the first decline in 10 years a bureau spokesman told China Daily .
In an unusually direct statement the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they can purchase manufacturers ' goods .
This will prevent a slide in industrial production which will otherwise cause new panic buyings the spokesman said .
The 1986 tax overhaul the biggest achievement of President Reagan 's second term is beginning to fall apart and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over Capitol Hill .
Real-estate executives are lobbying to ease anti-tax-shelter rules .
Charitable groups are trying to reinstate the write-off for contributions made by individuals who do n't itemize their deductions .
Big auction houses want to make collectibles eligible for lower capital-gains taxes .
And heavy-industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax credit .
Everything is up for grabs says Theodore Groom a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies .
Adds Robert Juliano the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again .
The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress .
Other fundamental reforms of the 1986 act have been threatened as well .
The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes .
The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts and also to bring back income averaging for farmers a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years .
As part of the same bill the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations in what committee member Sen. David Pryor D. Ark .
calls a feeding frenzy of special-interest legislating .
The beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops .
To be sure the full Senate facing a fast-approaching budget deadline last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill .
But lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary .
Other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts including both the capital-gains and IRA provisions .
There is n't any doubt that the thread of the '86 code has been given a mighty tug says Rep. Thomas Downey D. N.Y .
.
You 'll see the annual unraveling of it .
It 's back to tax-give-away time for the select few says Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania the third-ranking Democrat in the House .
Referring to the chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees he adds Next year every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on Lloyd Bentsen 's door on Danny Rostenkowski 's door .
Many groups are n't waiting that long .
Just last week a House Ways and Means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities companies and interest groups who want to open their own special loopholes .
It 's a Swiss-cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings .
Even lobbyists for heavy industry one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill are encouraged .
The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation write-offs or investment credits says Paul Huard a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers .
Corporate lobbyist Charls Walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve competitiveness .
In reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation groups are lobbying to make sure they are n't left off the gravy train .
Real-estate interests for example are protesting an omission in President Bush 's capital-gains proposal It does n't include real-estate gains .
If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains they certainly want to be part of it says real-estate lobbyist Wayne Thevenot of Concord Associates .
In the House-passed tax bill Mr. Thevenot got his wish real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision .
But Sotheby 's Christie 's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs .
They have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment .
Collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets the letter states .
All of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 .
In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others .
The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes .
Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses also known as passive losses that made many tax shelters possible .
Many other tax benefits also were swept away .
This year Congress with prodding from President Bush has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code .
It appears likely that this year or next some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted .
Other tax benefits probably will be restored and created .
The main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them .
The '86 act was a fluke .
They wanted reform and they got a revolution says overhaul advocate Rep. Willis Gradison R. Ohio .
So is the tax code now open game again .
Mr. Juliano thinks so .
One recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to San Francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of Chicago for the 30th reunion of St. Ignatius High School .
I 'm too old to waste a weekend but that 's what I did the 48-year-old Mr. Juliano moans .
These days anything can happen .
Lufthansa AG said passenger volume climbed 5.2 % for the first nine months of 1989 to 15.3 million passengers from 14.5 million passengers in the year-earlier period .
The West German national air carrier said cargo volume jumped 12 % to 638,000 metric tons from 569,000 tons a year ago .
Load factor or percentage of seats filled climbed to 67.1 % from 66.6 % even though the number of flights rose 6.9 % to 215,845 in the first-three quarters .
From January through September the distance flown by Lufthansa airplanes rose 5.6 % to 266.2 million kilometers from a year earlier the company added .
Raymond Chandler in a 1950 letter defending a weak Hemingway book likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher .
When the champ has lost his stuff the great mystery novelist wrote when he can no longer throw the high hard one he throws his heart instead .
He throws something .
He does n't just walk off the mound and weep .
Chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career .
His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe the inferior Playback 1958 at times read almost like a parody of his previous work .
When he died in 1959 Chandler left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book The Poodle Springs Story which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque .
Champ Chandler 's last pitch apparently was a screwball .
Now Robert Parker author of several best sellers featuring Spenser a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired to complete The Poodle Springs Story .
The result Poodle Springs Putnam 's 288 pages 18.95 is an entertaining easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color .
If it does not quite have Chandler 's special magic well at the end neither did Chandler .
As the book begins a newly Marlowe roars into the desert resort of Poodle a.k.a .
Palm Springs at the wheel of a Cadillac Fleetwood .
His bride is the rich and beautiful Linda Loring a character who also appeared in Chandler 's The Long Goodbye and Playback .
Philip and Linda move into her mansion and ca n't keep their hands off each other even in front of the Hawaiian\/Japanese houseman .
But the lovebirds have a conflict .
He wants to continue being a low-paid private eye and she wants him to live off the million dollars she 's settled on him .
That 's Chandler 's setup .
Mr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds .
The supporting lineup is solid the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls the good cop of previous Chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes .
The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler 's prose at its most pared down .
All told Mr. Parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect .
But there are grounds for complaint .
At one point the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro .
More bothersome there are several apparent anachronisms .
Contact lenses tank tops prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s .
A little more care in re-creating Marlowe 's universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable .
Mr. Nolan is a contributing editor at Los Angeles Magazine .
Ko Shioya spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of Reader 's Digest .
Japan has been a major importer of foreign information and news says Mr. Shioya .
But one gets fed up with importing information and news .
Mr. Shioya has turned the tables .
Today he is publisher of Business Tokyo magazine the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business .
After a slick redesign the two-year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company Keizaikai Corp. the Tokyo-based company with interests that include financial services book publishing and a tourist agency .
Printed in the U.S. and carrying the line The Insider 's Japan Business Tokyo 's October cover story was The World 's No. 1 Customer Japanese women .
Keizaikai is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing after making major investments in entertainment real estate and banking companies here .
Japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers to study the U.S. market including the New York-based investment banker Veronis Suhler & Associates .
And they are quietly linking up with U.S. publishing trade groups .
Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries said John Veronis chairman of Veronis Suhler .
While there are n't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of Sony Corp. 's recent 3.4 billion agreement to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. observers do n't rule out a transaction of that size .
The Japanese take the long view .
said Mr. Veronis .
It may not be weeks or months but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable they will move on a deal he said .
In recent months three big Tokyo-based publishing concerns including Nikkei Business Publications Nikkei Home no relation and Magazine House applied for membership in Magazine Publishers of America which represents almost all U.S. consumer magazines .
Japanese involvement in American publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as Business Tokyo are considered groundbreakers .
When Keizaikai launched Business Tokyo in 1987 it appealed to a more multinational audience .
The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers .
American publishers appear more than ready to do some selling .
Susumu Ohara president of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc. publisher of the Japan Economic Journal said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine .
The Japanese are in the early stage right now said Thomas Kenney a onetime media adviser for First Boston Corp. who was recently appointed president of Reader 's Digest Association 's new Magazine Publishing Group .
Before they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft .
Now they realize magazines are as much a franchise as Nabisco is a franchise .
Bell Atlantic Corp. and Southern New England Telecommunications posted strong profit gains for the third quarter while Nynex Corp. Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. reported earnings declines for the period .
Rate settlements in Minnesota and Colorado depressed U S West 's third-quarter profit .
Denver-based U S West said net income dropped 8.9 % noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its BetaWest Properties unit .
Revenue dropped 4.3 % to 2.3 billion from 2.4 billion reflecting declines in its consumer-telephone sector long-distance carrier business and diversified division .
Revenue from business-telephone operations grew 3.3 % to 618.9 million from 599.4 million a year ago .
New telephone lines posted healthy growth .
Overall they increased 2.8 % to 12.1 million putting U S West over the 12 million mark for the first time .
Business lines increased 3.7 % to 3.3 million .
On a truly comparable basis we 've seen modest earnings growth this year from the operations of our company said Jack MacAllister chairman and chief executive officer .
The major negative factor was the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years .
He said the company expects to be on target with analysts ' projections by year end but conceded that the fourth quarter represents a significant challenge .
Expenses in the quarter dropped 11.2 % to 664.3 million from 747.7 million a year ago .
Yesterday U S West shares rose 75 cents to close at 71.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic said net rose 6.5 % aided by strong growth in the network-services business and an increase in the number of new telephone lines .
Revenue jumped 5.6 % to 2.9 billion from 2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter .
Revenue from financial and real-estate services jumped 23 % to 177.4 million from 144.1 million a year ago .
Network-access revenue from long-distance telephone companies increased 6.4 % to 618.6 million .
Bell Atlantic added 148,000 new telephone lines in the quarter for a total of 16.9 million .
The company said per-share earnings were slightly reduced by the sale of 4.1 million shares of treasury stock to the company 's newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plans .
In composite trading on the Big Board Bell Atlantic closed at 100.625 up 1.50 a share .
At Nynex net slumped 14.8 % primarily because of a continuing strike by 60,000 employees lower-than-expected profit at its New York Telephone unit and significantly higher taxes and costs .
State and local taxes increased to 131.3 million from 99.1 million a year ago .
Nynex said expenses rose 4.5 % to 2.73 billion from 2.61 billion a 119 million increase .
Most of the higher costs were associated with acquisitions and growth in nonregulated business units it added .
Our net income is n't where we would want it to be at this point said William C. Ferguson chairman and chief executive officer .
This deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at New York Telephone .
Mr. Ferguson said a continued softness in New York City area 's economy and increased competition particularly in the private-line market took a heavy toll on earnings .
The three-month-old strike at Nynex seriously hurt the installation of new telephone lines in the quarter .
Nynex said access lines in service at the end of the quarter were off 18,000 from the previous quarter which reported an increase of 160,000 new access lines .
Revenue rose to 3.31 billion from 3.18 billion mostly from acquisition of AGS Computers and robust non-regulated businesses .
In Big Board composite trading yesterday Nynex common closed at 81.125 up 1.625 .
Southern New England Telecommunications which bolstered its marketing efforts for telephone and non-telephone subsidiaries reported that net increased 8.1 % .
Walter H. Monteith Jr. SNET chairman and chief executive officer said Innovative marketing of our products and services contributed to increase revenue .
Revenue and sales increased 7.5 % to 423.9 million from 394.4 million a year earlier .
Yellow pages advertising sales rose 11.8 % to 41.2 million .
Cost and expenses for the quarter excluding interest increased 6.1 % to 333.3 million from 314 million the year before .
SNET common rose 1.25 to 85.50 a share yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board .
San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis said net declined 12.6 % primarily because of regulatory action .
Revenue was about flat at 2.4 billion .
Revenue was reduced 33 million by three extraordinary items a California Public Utilities Commission refund for an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. billing adjustment a provision for productivity sharing to be paid to customers in 1990 and a one-time accrual for a toll settlement with long-distance telephone companies .
Excluding the one-time charges the company would have posted earnings of 298 million or 73 cents a share .
The company also was hurt by a 289 million rate reduction that went into effect in 1989 .
This is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals said Sam Ginn chairman and chief executive officer .
Pacific Telesis said new telephone lines increased 4.5 % for a total of about 13.5 million for the quarter toll calls increased 9.6 % to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion .
In Big Board composite trading yesterday Pacific Telesis common closed at 45.50 up 87.5 cents .
a Includes a one-time gain of 88.7 million from a commonstock sale by U S West 's U S West New Vector Group .
b Includes a 41.3 million gain on the sale of FiberCom .
Amoco Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 39 % to 336 million or 65 cents a share as gasoline refining and marketing profits lagged substantially behind last year 's record level .
A charge of 80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results .
A spokesman said Amoco completed an environmental analysis last quarter but that no single clean-up project was responsible .
In the 1988 third quarter the Chicago-based oil company earned 552 million or 1.07 a share .
Revenue in the latest quarter rose 12 % to 6.6 billion from 5.91 billion .
Aside from the special charge Amoco 's results were in line with Wall Street estimates .
The company 's stock ended at 48.375 up 25 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Amoco is the first major oil company to report third-quarter results .
Analysts expect others to show a similar pattern .
Generally in the quarter overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability .
The industry 's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity has depressed prices .
Gasoline margins may rebound this quarter some industry officials say but they believe chemical margins could worsen .
American Petrofina Inc. a Dallas-based integrated oil company yesterday said its third-quarter earnings declined by more than half .
Fina blamed lower chemical prices reduced gasoline margins and refinery maintenance shutdowns .
It said net income dropped to 15.1 million or 98 cents a share from 35.2 million or 2.66 a share .
Sales rose 2.2 % to 711.9 million from 696.1 million .
Amoco 's refining and marketing profit in the quarter fell to 134 million from 319 million .
Chemical earnings declined by one-third to 120 million last year 's robust levels .
Amoco 's domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of 104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of 5 million primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices said Chairman Richard M. Morrow .
Amoco also sharply boosted natural-gas output part of it from properties acquired from Tenneco Inc. last year .
But foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply to 12 million from 95 million .
Higher oil prices were n't enough to offset a roughly 20 million charge related to a 10 % reduction in Amoco 's Canadian work force as well as increased exploration expenses .
For the nine months Amoco said that net income fell to 1.29 billion from 1.69 billion but if unusual items are excluded operations produced essentially flat results .
Revenue rose 12 % to 19.93 billion from 17.73 billion .
James F. Gero former chairman and chief executive officer of Varo Inc. and Richard J. Hatchett III a Dallas investment banker were elected directors of this medical-products concern boosting the board to seven members .
For retailers Christmas not Halloween promises to be this year 's spookiest season .
Many retailers fear a price war will erupt if cash-strapped companies such as Campeau Corp. slash tags to spur sales .
Concerns about the stock market doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also haunt store operators .
Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer asserts Norman Abramson president and chief operating officer of Clothestime Inc. an off-price chain .
Even if there is n't any widespread discounting the outlook for industry profits is n't good .
Management Horizons forecasts a 1.4 % profit decline for non-auto retailers this year after annual drops that averaged 4.5 % in 1988 and 1987 .
For the last two and a half years retailing has been in a mild recession says Carl Steidtmann chief economist at the Columbus Ohio consulting firm .
This year many stores are entering the Christmas season in turmoil Bonwit Teller and B. Altman parent L.J. Hooker Corp. is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code B.A.T Industries PLC 's healthy Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field 's chains are on the auction block Campeau 's Bloomingdale 's is also on the block .
Industry observers expect a wide divergence in performance .
Stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly and to lose customers to stable chains such as Limited Inc. May Department Stores Co. and Dillard Department Stores Inc. which should do well .
There are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers says Cynthia Turk a Touche Ross & Co. retail consultant .
Says Mr. Steidtmann I 'm looking for a bi-polar Christmas .
Economists expect general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter to rise 4.5 % to 6 % from year-ago figures .
But Mr. Steidtmann predicts that healthy stores hawking mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as 25 % to 30 % .
Troubled chains could see their sales drop as much as 8 % he believes as managers distracted by fears about the future allow their stores to get sloppy .
Thin merchandise selections at the most troubled chains are also expected to hurt sales .
Catalog companies are likely to pose a bigger threat to all stores this year particularly in December .
More than 200 catalog outfits are promoting a low-cost Federal Express service that guarantees pre-Christmas delivery of orders made by a certain date .
Traditionally consumers were concerned about ordering after the first of December because they did n't believe they would get it by Christmas says Adam Strum chairman of the Wine Enthusiast Inc. which sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail .
Using Federal Express delivery last year Mr. Strum says December was our biggest month .
Even Sears Roebuck & Co. is getting into the act offering for the first time to have Federal Express deliver toys ordered by Dec. 20 from its Wish Book catalog .
K mart Corp. Chairman Joseph E. Antonini summed up his outlook for the Christmas season as not troublesome .
He 's not predicting a blockbuster but he is more optimistic than three months ago because employment remains strong and inflation low .
Other retailers are also preparing for a ho-hum holiday .
Philip M. Hawley chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. expects sales at department stores open at least a year to rise a modest 3 % to 5 % over last year 's totals both for his company and the industry in general .
I 'm not looking for a runaway Christmas at all he says .
It is n't a real boom holiday season in our eyes says Woolworth Corp. Chairman Harold E. Sells but it is n't going to be a bust either .
Mr. Sells expects fourth-quarter sales at his company which besides Woolworth stores includes Kinney and Foot Locker shoe stores and other specialty chains to rise pretty much in line with its year-to-date increases of between 8 % and 9 % .
The estimate includes the results of new stores .
A consumer poll conducted in early September by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates a market researcher based in Chicago also suggests a modest holiday .
Of the 450 survey respondents 35 % said they expect to spend less buying Christmas gifts this year than last year while 28 % said they expect to spend more and 37 % said their gift budget would stay the same .
The results are almost identical to Shapiro 's September 1988 numbers .
Retailers could get a boost this year from the calendar .
Christmas falls on a Monday creating a big last-minute weekend opportunity for stores .
Most will stay open late Saturday night and open their doors again Sunday .
But many consumers probably will use the extra time to put off some purchasing until the last minute .
What you 'll hear as we get into December is that sales are sluggish predicts Woolworth 's Mr. Sells .
The week ending the 24th is going to save the entire month for everyone .
The Spanish author Camilo Jose Cela won the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday a surprising choice but given the Swedish Academy 's past perversities hardly the most undeserved and ridiculous accolade handed out by the awarding committee .
In Spain anyway the 73-year-old Mr. Cela enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books he wrote during the parched Franco years the everyday poverty and stagnant atmosphere of which he described in brutally direct vivid prose beginning with The Family of Pascal Duarte 1942 .
Unlike other writers who either battled the fascists during the Civil War or left Spain when Franco triumphed Mr. Cela fought briefly on the general 's side no doubt earning with his war wound some forbearance when he went on to depict a country with a high population of vagabonds murderers and rural idiots trudging aimlessly through a dried-out land .
Still it was in Argentine editions that his countrymen first read his story of Pascal Duarte a field worker who stabbed his mother to death and has no regrets as he awaits his end in a prison cell Fate directs some men down the flower-bordered path and others down the road bordered with thistles and prickly pears .
The lucky ones gaze out at life with serene eyes and smile with a face of innocence at their perfumed happiness .
The others endure the hot sun of the plains and scowl like cornered wild beasts .
Mr. Cela himself was one of the lucky ones his fortunes steadily increasing over the decades he spent putting out some 70 travelogues novels short story collections and poetry .
These days he is as known for his flamboyant tastes and the youthful muse who shares his life as he is for his books .
The man who wore out his shoes wandering around Guadalajara in 1958 describing in his travel book Viaje a la Alcarria how he scrounged for food and stayed in squalid inns now tours Spain in a Rolls-Royce .
Of his 10 novels The Hive 1951 full of sharp vignettes of Madrid life and centered on a cafe run by Dona Rosa a foul-mouthed broad-based woman with blackened little teeth encrusted in filth used to be available in English translated by J.M. Cohen and published by Ecco Press which now no doubt regrets relinquishing its copyright .
Here is an excerpt The lonely woman walks on in the direction of the Plaza de Alonso Martinez .
Two men have a conversation behind one of the windows of the cafe on the corner of the boulevard .
Both are young one twenty odd the other thirty odd .
The older one looks like a member of the jury for a literary award the younger one looks like a novelist .
It is evident that their conversation runs more or less on the following lines I 've submitted the manuscript of my novel under the title Teresa de Cepeda ' and in it I 've treated a few neglected aspects of that eternal problem which Oh yes .
Will you pour me a drop of water if you do n't mind .
With pleasure .
I 've revised it several times and I think I may say with pride that there is not a single discordant word in the whole text .
How interesting .
I think so .
I do n't know the quality of the works my colleagues have sent in but in any case I feel confident that good sense and honest judgment Rest assured we proceed with exemplary fairness .
I do n't doubt it for a moment .
It does not matter if one is defeated provided the work that gets the award has unmistakable qualities .
What 's so discouraging is In passing the window Senorita Elvira gives them a smile simply out of habit .
Ashland Oil Inc. said it will take after-tax charges of 78 million or 1.40 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .
Because of the charge Ashland expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and significantly lower results for fiscal 1989 .
The oil refiner said it will report fiscal fourth quarter and 1989 results next week .
The company earned 66 million or 1.19 a share on revenue of 2.1 billion in the year-ago fourth quarter .
For fiscal 1988 Ashland had net of 224 million or 4.01 a share on revenue of 7.8 billion .
Both revenue figures exclude excise taxes .
The charges consist of a 25 million after-tax charge to cover cost overruns in Ashland 's Riley Consolidated subsidiary a previously announced 38 million after-tax charge resulting from a 325 million settlement with National Iranian Oil Co. and a 15 million after-tax charge from the previously announced sale of its Ashland Technology Corp. subsidiary .
Ashland expects that sale to be complete next year .
The charge for the Riley subsidiary is for expected costs to correct problems with certain bed boilers built for utilities .
The charge will be added to 20 million in reserves established a year ago to cover the cost overruns .
When President Bush arrives here next week for a hemispheric summit organized to commemorate a century of Costa Rican democracy will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the Panamanian fiasco .
Undoubtedly Mr. Bush will be praised by some Latin leaders prone to pay lip service to nonintervention while they privately encourage more assertive U.S. action to remove Gen. Manuel Noriega and safeguard their countries from a Sandinista onslaught .
The Panamanian affair is only the tip of a more alarming iceberg .
It originates in a Bush administration decision not to antagonize the U.S. Congress and avoid at all costs being accused of meddling in the region .
The result has been a dangerous vacuum of U.S. leadership which leaves Central America open to Soviet adventurism .
The influence of the U.S. is not being felt in Central America Washington 's decisions do not respond to a policy and are divorced from reality says Fernando Volio a Costa Rican congressman and former foreign minister .
The disarray of the Bush administration 's Latin diplomacy was evident in the failure of the Organization of American States to condemn categorically Gen. Noriega .
Faced with this embarrassment U.S. diplomats expressed confidence that the influential Rio Group of South American nations which gathered last week in Peru would take a stronger posture toward the Panamanian dictator .
But other than a few slaps on the wrist Gen. Noriega went unpunished by that body too he was not even singled out in the closing statement .
Now Mr. Bush will come to Costa Rica and encounter Nicaraguan strongman Daniel Ortega eager for photo opportunities with the U.S. president .
The host Costa Rican President Oscar Arias did not invite Chile Cuba Panama or Haiti to the summit which was to be restricted to democracies .
However Mr. Ortega was included .
Formally upgrading the Sandinistas to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized in the Costa Rican press .
Even Carlos Manuel Castillo the presidential candidate for Mr. Arias 's National Liberation Party made public his opposition to the presence of Nicaragua in a democratic festivity .
Nevertheless the Bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in July a few weeks before the Central American presidents met in Tela Honduras to discuss a timetable for disbanding the anti-Sandinista rebels .
According to officials in Washington the State Department hoped that by pleasing President Arias it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the Contras until after Mr. Ortega 's promises of democratic elections were tested next February .
However relying on an ardent critic of the Reagan administration and the Contra movement for help in delaying the disarming of the Contras was risky business .
And even some last-minute phone calls that Mr. Bush made at the behest of some conservative U.S. senators to enlist backing for the U.S. position failed to stop the march of Mr. Arias 's agenda .
Prior to this episode Sen. Christopher Dodd D. Conn. sensing an open field undertook a personal diplomatic mission through Central America to promote an early disbanding of the rebels .
Visiting Nicaragua he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral system and chided the Bush administration for not rewarding the Sandinistas .
In Honduras where the Contras are a hot political issue he promised to help unblock some 70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with Washington .
Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani Mr. Cristiani 's government is very much at the mercy of U.S. largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. Dodd 's likes and dislikes .
It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the U.S. virtually neglected by the Bush administration ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by December long before the elections .
Fittingly the Tela Accords were nicknamed by Hondurans the Dodd plan .
The individual foreign policy carried out by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in Central America .
On Oct. 3 following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim Nicaragua 's great peace efforts .
There Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America .
He also called on Nicaragua 's neighbors to accept a military equilibrium guaranteed by both superpowers .
The Pentagon claims that in spite of Moscow 's words East bloc weapons continue to flow into Nicaragua through Cuba at near-record levels .
Since Mr. Shevardnadze 's proposals followed discussions with Mr. Baker speculations arose that the Bush administration was seeking an accommodation with the Soviets in Central America .
This scheme would fit the Arias Plan which declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the Sandinista dictatorship and that provided by Washington to freely elected governments .
Furthermore it is also likely to encourage those on Capitol Hill asking for cuts in the assistance to El Salvador if President Cristiani does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas .
The sad condition of U.S. policy in Central America is best depicted by the recent end to U.S. sponsorship of Radio Costa Rica .
In 1984 the Costa Rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country flooded by airwaves of Sandinista propaganda .
Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of Radio Costa Rica funded by the U.S. and affiliated with the Voice of America VOA .
A few months ago the Bush administration decided to stop this cooperation leaving Radio Costa Rica operating on a shoestring .
According to news reports the abrupt termination was due to fears that VOA transmissions could interfere with the peace process .
In the meantime Russia gave Nicaragua another powerful radio transmitter which has been installed in the city of Esteli .
It is capable of reaching the entire Caribbean area and deep into North America .
Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the Soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to U.S. default .
The Soviet entrenchment in Nicaragua is alarming for Costa Rica a peaceful democracy without an army .
Questioned in Washington about what would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail President Arias voiced expectations of direct U.S. action .
A poll conducted in July by a Gallup affiliate showed that 64 % of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either Nicaragua or Panama the U.S. will come to its defense .
But in the light of events in Panama where the U.S. has such clear strategic interests waiting for the Delta Force may prove to be a dangerous gambit .

Holiday Corp. said net income jumped 89 % partly on the strength of record operating income in its gaming division .
Separately the hotel and gambling giant said it was proceeding with plans to make a tender offer and solicit consents with respect to approximately 1.4 billion of its publicly traded debt .
That debt is part of the 2.1 billion of Holiday debt that Bass PLC of Britain said it would retire or assume when it agreed to buy the Holiday Inn business in August .
Holiday said third-quarter earnings rose to 39.8 million or 1.53 a share from 21 million or 84 cents a share a year earlier .
Results for the quarter included 19.2 million in pretax gains from property transactions including the sale of one Embassy Suites hotel and 3.5 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the acquisition of the Holiday Inn business by Bass .
Holiday said operating income related to gaming increased 4.5 % to a record 61.4 million from 58.8 million a year earlier .
The jump reflected record results in Las Vegas Nev. and Atlantic City N.J. as well as a full quarter 's results from Harrah 's Del Rio in Laughlin Nev .
Third-quarter revenue rose 2.7 % to 433.5 million from 422.1 million .
For the nine months earnings fell 2.9 % to 99.1 million or 3.86 a share from 102.1 million or 4.10 a share a year earlier .
Revenue dropped 1.6 % to 1.21 billion from 1.23 billion .
The tender offer and consent solicitation will be made to debtholders in December .
In effect Holiday is asking holders for permission for Bass to buy their debt .
Holiday said Salomon Brothers Inc. has been retained to act as the dealer-manager and financial adviser
