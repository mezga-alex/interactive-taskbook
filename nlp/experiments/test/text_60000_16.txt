Natural upheavals and most particularly earthquakes are not only horrible realities in and of themselves but also symbols through which the state of a society can be construed .
The rubble after the Armenian earthquake a year ago disclosed quite literally a city whose larger structures had been built with sand .
The extent of the disaster stemmed from years of chicanery and bureaucratic indifference .
The larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of San Francisco is surely with the state of the U.S. economy .
Did the stock-market tremors of Friday Oct. 13 presage larger fragility far greater upheavals .
Are the engineering and architecture of the economy as vulnerable as the spans of the Bay Bridge .
The eerie complacency of the Reagan-Bush era has produced Panglossian paeans about the present perfection of U.S. economic and social arrangements .
A licensed government intellectual Francis Fukuyama recently announced in The National Interest that history is so to speak at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of American civilization .
His observations were taken seriously .
But we are in reality witnessing the continuing decline of the political economy of capitalism not so much the end of history but the history of the end .
The financial equivalent of the sand used by those Armenian contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy-outs associated with them .
Builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it 's okay necessary even to look the other way .
And by the early 1980s U.S. capitalists had ample reason to welcome junk bonds to look the other way .
By that time they found extremely low profit rates from non-financial corporate investment .
Government statistics in fact show that the profit rate net pretax profits divided by capital stock peaked in 1965 at 17.2 % .
That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6 % in the recession year 1982 and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1 % in 1986 and 8 % in 1987 .
Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was in the early 1980s the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets the famous Q ratio associated with Prof. James Tobin .
In theory the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same .
But of course the market could decide that the firm 's capital stock its assets means nothing if the firm is not producing profits .
This is indeed what the market decided .
By 1982 the ratio was 43.5 % meaning that the market was valuing every dollar 's worth of the average firm 's assets at 43 cents .
From the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only 43 cents to buy a dollar 's worth of a firm 's capital stock an alert entrepreneur wo n't look the other way .
His assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits thus restoring the market 's faith in them .
Hence the LBO craze .
But here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way .
The profit rate is still low and the Q ratio was only 65 % in 1987 and 68.9 % in 1988 .
Result a landscape littered with lemons huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate America .
The mounting risks did not go unobserved even in the mid-1980s .
But there were enough promoters announcing the end of history in this case suspension of normal laws of economic gravity for society to continue shielding its eyes .
Mainstream economists and commentators craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs claimed the end result would be a leaner meaner corporate America with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall .
But this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found .
The beneficiaries were those financiers whose icon was the topic figure of '80s capitalism Michael Milken 's 517 million salary in one year .
Left-stream economists I associate with fellows in the Union of Radical Political Economists most particularly Robert Pollin of the economics faculty at the University of California at Riverside were not hypnotized in the manner of their pliant colleagues .
All along they have been noting the tremors and pointing out the underlying realities .
Profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher and now we have an extremely high-interest burden relative to cash flow .
The consequences of building empires with sand are showing up .
In contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at 2 % or 3 % a Harvard study published in April of this year and discussed in a lead story in The Wall Street Journal for Sept. 18 found the default rate on these junk bonds is 34 % .
What is the consequence of a high-interest burden high default rates and continued low profitability .
Corporations need liquidity in the form of borrowed funds .
Without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits they look to the government which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or bailouts .
The consequence can be inflation brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the deflationary shock of a sudden crash .
Attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort an assault on wages .
Mr. Fukuyama peering through binoculars at the end of history said in his essay that the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the West the egalitarianism of modern America represents the essential achievement of the classless society envisioned by Marx .
Mr. Fukuyama might want to consult some American workers on the subject of class and egalitarianism .
From its peak in 1972 of 198.41 the average American weekly wage had fallen to 169.28 in 1987 both figures being expressed in 1977 dollars .
In other words after the glory boom of the Reagan years wages had sunk from the post World War II peak by 16 % as capitalists helped by the government turned down the screws or went offshore .
But there are signs now the strikes by miners Boeing workers telephone workers etc. that this attack on wages is being more fiercely resisted .
These are long-term Richter readings on American capitalism .
The whole structure is extremely shaky .
Governments have become sophisticated in handling moments of panic a word the London Times forbade my father to use when he was reporting the Wall Street crash in 1929 .
But sophistication has its limits .
The S&L bailout could cost 300 billion computing interest on the government 's loans .
These are real costs .
Under what weights will the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation totter .
Capitalism may now be engineered to withstand sudden shocks but there are fault lines the crisis in profits the assault on wages the structural inequity of the system that make fools of those who claim that the future is here and that history is over .
Mr. Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation and LA Weekly .
Japan Air Lines Lufthansa German Airlines and Air France reportedly plan to form an international air-freight company this year a move that could further consolidate the industry .
Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground-cargo and air-cargo systems .
They reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion yen 140 million in the venture whose headquarters would be in France or West Germany .
The action follows Federal Express Corp. 's acquisition of Flying Tiger Line Inc. in August .
After that it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly said Cotton Daly director of cargo services for New York consulting firm Simat Helliesen & Eichner Inc .
Mr. Daly said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by Federal Express United Parcel Service of America Inc. and other fast-growing air-freight companies .
Many airlines are talking about cargo ventures and there have been rumors about such a tie between JAL and European airlines .
In Tokyo a JAL spokesman said he could n't confirm or deny the latest Japanese report .
But he said JAL is talking to Lufthansa and Air France about some sort of cargo venture .
It is just one of a number of strategies JAL has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in Europe after 1992 the deadline for ending trade barriers in the EC he said .
In Frankfurt a Lufthansa spokesman confirmed talks are under way but declined to comment .
A Lufthansa spokeswoman in Tokyo said the head of Lufthansa 's cargo operations had been in Toyko last week for talks with JAL .
In Paris Air France declined to comment .
Nothing is defined or signed at this point Mr. Daly said of the talks .
Whatever accord the three carriers reach he said he is skeptical it would create a separate airline .
If the three companies pool their air-freight businesses their clout would be considerable .
According to figures from the International Air Transport Association they carried a combined 1.8 million tons of freight last year .
Federal Express and Flying Tiger as separate companies carried a combined 2.6 million tons .
Air France and Lufthansa last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities .
They plan to increase cooperation in freight ground-handling and create a world-wide computer system to process cargo .
Other airlines would have access to the system they said and negotiations with partners were already under way .
Both European airlines operate extensive fleets of Boeing 747 freighters and 747 Combis aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck .
They currently have large orders for cargo planes .
Several airlines including Lufthansa JAL and Cathay Pacific Airways are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join Mr. Daly said .
JAL also has signaled it is looking for toeholds in Europe before the end of 1992 .
Last month the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from British Airways so it could funnel its passengers from London to other European destinations .
British Airways said it has n't received a proposal from JAL .
But last week there were air-traffic negotiations between the U.K. and Japan a likely first step to any commercial agreement between JAL and British Airways or another U.K. carrier .
Federal Paper Board Co. said it completed the previously announced purchase of Imperial Cup Corp. a closely held maker of paper cups based in Kenton Ohio .
Terms were n't disclosed .
Imperial Cup has annual sales of approximately 75 million .
Federal Paper Board sells paper and wood products .
In a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the California earthquake the Securities and Exchange Commission said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange to the American New York and Philadelphia stock exchanges and to the Chicago Board Options Exchange .
The decision which affects millions of dollars of trading positions was made late yesterday because the Pacific exchange 's options floor was shut down as a result of Tuesday 's earthquake .
The SEC faced with a major squeeze on options positions said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow .
SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the Pacific exchange guaranteeing the liquidity of the market .
Officials at the four exchanges said well over 50 traders from the Pacific exchange were taking flights from San Francisco late yesterday to the American New York and Philadelphia exchanges and to the CBOE where they would continue making markets in the Pacific-listed options .
The Big Board said carpenters quickly erected a new options floor to accomodate 40 traders from the Pacific exchange .
In addition specialists on the exchanges agreed to provide backup capital for market-making in Pacific exchange options traded on the exchanges .
Trading was light on the Pacific Stock Exchange yesterday with workers at the exchange 's main floor in San Francisco struggling to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage .
The most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading .
The Pacific exchange has options for 129 underlying stock issues including highly active Hilton Hotels Corp. which is listed on the Big Board .
Investors were concerned that they might be unable to exercise options that expire tomorrow .
But professionals said throughout the day that the shutdown would n't be a cause for alarm even if it were to persist for several days .
I 've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options because they are guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corp. said Michael Schwartz a senior registered options strategist at Oppenheimer & Co .
The SEC reassigned trading in the options however to allow investors to do more than simply exercise the options .
While the exchange 's equities floor in San Francisco remained open on a limited basis orders were being routed and executed in Los Angeles .
Workers could dial out but they could n't receive telephone calls .
It 's a very uncertain situation right now said Navin Vyas administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange which has daily volume of about 10 million shares .
Because the exchange 's computer was rerouting orders to the exchange 's trading operations in Los Angeles business is as usual Mr. Vyas said .
If one city is down the other can take over .
Meanwhile the brokerage firms in San Francisco were trying to cope .
Charles Daggs chairman and chief executive officer of Sutro & Co. said traders came to work at 5 a.m. PDT many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company 's two main facilities there .
That should happen by today he said .
Traders worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of incoming phone calls .
Also most of the telecommunications equipment was out .
The traders were executing municipal bond mutual fund and other orders through a sister firm Tucker Anthony Inc. which is also owned by John Hancock Freedom Securities but is based in New York .
We are having a regular day .
Volume is down out of San Francisco but not out of the 11 outlying offices Mr. Daggs added .
Sutro 's Oakland office executed orders through the Sacramento office which was n't affected by the quake .
Others like Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. which has eight offices in the San Francisco area set up an 800 number yesterday morning for customers to obtain market commentary and other help .
At Kidder Peabody & Co. 's Sacramento branch Manager Janet White received calls yesterday morning from workers in San Francisco who offered to work in Sacramento .
Then she discovered that Quotron Systems Inc. 's Sacramento lines were down because they are normally tied in through a system that goes through San Francisco .
So the Kidder brokers had to call other company offices to get quotes on stocks .
At Quotron the company 's National Call-In Center which swung into action for the first time last month for Hurricane Hugo assembled a tactical team at 5 a.m. yesterday to begin rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders .
The company dispatched as many as 200 people in the San Francisco area to do the work though most of the rerouting was done by computer .
Service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown San Francisco while just parts of Oakland and San Jose were knocked out .
But Dale Irvine director of the emergency center said service was being restored to outlying San Francisco areas .
In Chicago yesterday Options Clearing confirmed that it guarantees the Pacific exchange options .
The firm also will permit its members and the public to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the Pacific exchange even if the exchange is closed said Wayne Luthringshausen chairman of Options Clearing .
Put options give holders the right but not the obligation to sell a financial instrument at a specified price while call options give holders the right but not the obligation to buy a financial instrument at a specified price .
Investors and traders in Pacific exchange options are protected to the extent that they can convert their put and call options into the underlying instrument Mr. Luthringshausen said .
We are seeing such exercises today in fact .
International Business Machines Corp. said its board approved the purchase of 1 billion of its common shares a move that should help support its battered stock .
Even as the stock market has generally done well this year IBM 's shares have slipped steadily from its 52-week high of 130.875 .
Yesterday 's closing price of 101.75 down 50 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange puts the stock at about 1 1\/2 times book value which is as low as it has sunk over the past decade .
The announcement came after the market 's close .
The move by IBM was n't exactly a surprise .
The company has spent some 5 billion over the past 3 1\/2 years to buy back 42 million common shares or roughly 7 % of those outstanding .
In addition despite IBM 's well-publicized recent problems the computer giant still generates enormous amounts of cash .
As of the end of the second quarter it had 4.47 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand .
As a result some securities analysts had predicted in recent days that IBM would authorize additional purchases .
In Armonk N.Y. a spokesman said that although IBM did n't view its spending as necessarily a way to support the stock it thought the purchases were a good way to improve such financial measurements as per-share earnings and return on equity .
We view it as a good long-term investment the spokesman said .
In the short term the move is likely to have little effect .
At yesterday 's closing price 1 billion would buy back about 10 million shares or less than 2 % of the roughly 580 million outstanding .
In addition as of Sept. 30 the company still had authorization to buy 368 million of stock under a prior repurchase program .
Over the long term however IBM 's stock repurchases along with its hefty 4.84-a-share annual dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional investors are providing a floor for the stock price .
Although IBM last year produced its first strong results in four years and was expected to continue to roll this year it began faltering as early as January .
First it had trouble manufacturing a chip for its mainframes IBM 's bread-and-butter business .
Then it had a series of smaller glitches including problems manufacturing certain personal computers and the delay in the announcement of some important workstations .
Finally IBM had to delay the introduction of some high-end disk drives which account for 10 % of its 60 billion of annual revenue .
None of the problems is necessarily fatal and they are n't all necessarily even related .
There are also other factors at work that are outside IBM 's control such as currency exchange rates .
The strong dollar which reduces the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they are translated into dollars is expected to knock 80 to 85 cents off IBM 's per-share earnings for the full year .
Without that problem IBM might have matched last year 's earnings of 5.81 billion or 9.80 a share .
Still investors will take some convincing before they get back into IBM 's stock in a big way .
Steve Milunovich a securities analyst at First Boston said that while investors were looking for an excuse to buy IBM shares a year ago even the big institutional investors are looking for a reason to avoid the stock these days .
On Wall Street yesterday northern California 's killer earthquake was just another chance to make a buck .
At the opening bell investors quickly began singling out shares of companies expected to profit or suffer in some way from the California disaster including insurers construction-related companies refiners and housing lenders .
Brokerage houses jumped in touting post-quake demand stocks and Kidder Peabody & Co. set up a toll-free hot line for San Franciscans who might need emergency investment advice and help in transferring funds .
Wall Street thinks of everything in terms of money says Tom Gallagher a senior Oppenheimer & Co. trader .
However he added such event-driven trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information .
The most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as General Re Corp. which rose 2.75 to 86.50 Nac Re Corp. up 2 to 37.75 American International Group Inc. up 3.25 to 102.625 and Cigna Corp. up 87.5 cents to 62.50 .
Yesterday the brokerage firm Conning & Co. said insurers will use the earthquake as an excuse to raise insurance rates ending their long price wars .
Before this bullish theory surfaced some insurance stocks initially fell indicating that investors thought the quake might cost insurers a lot of money .
In fact Fireman 's Fund Corp. which ended the day off 50 cents to 36.50 said earthquake damage would slightly hurt fourth-quarter profit .
On the prospect for rebuilding northern California investors bid up cement-makers Calmat Co. up 2.75 to 28.75 and Lone Star Industries Inc. up 1.75 to 29.25 .
Bridge and road builders had a field day including Kasler Corp. up 2.125 to 9.875 Guy F. Atkinson Co. up 87.5 to 61.875 and Morrison Knudsen Corp. which reported higher third-quarter earnings yesterday up 2.25 to 44.125 .
Fluor Corp. a construction engineering firm gained 75 cents to 33.375 .
But home-building stocks were a mixed bag .
Timber stocks got a big boost .
Georgia Pacific Corp. up 1.25 to 58 and Maxxam Inc. up 3 to 43.75 both reported strong profits .
Merrill Lynch & Co. touted Georgia-Pacific Louisiana Pacific Corp. and Willamette Industries Inc. as the best post-quake plywood plays .
Other gainers were companies with one or more undamaged California refineries .
Tosco Corp. jumped 1.125 to 20.125 and Chevron Corp. despite a temporary pipeline shutdown rose 1 to 65 .
Meanwhile shares of some big housing lenders got hit on the likelihood that the lenders ' collateral people 's homes suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in value .
Wells Fargo & Co. fell 50 cents to 81.50 and BankAmerica Corp. fell 50 cents to 31.875 .
Some California thrift stocks also fell including Golden West Financial Corp. and H.F. Ahmanson & Co. which reported lower earnings yesterday .
Property values did n't go up in California yesterday says one money manager .
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. fell 37.5 cents to 19.625 .
One of its power generators was damaged though the company said there wo n't be any financial impact .
Pacific Telesis Group lost 62.5 cents to 44.625 .
A computer failure delayed its earnings announcement and some investors think it might have extra costs to repair damaged telephone lines .
Heavy construction property-casualty insurance and forest products were among the best performing industry groups in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index yesterday .
Friday 's stock market plunge claimed its second victim among the scores of futures and options trading firms here .
Petco Options an options trading firm owned by the family of the deceased former Chicago Board of Trade chairman Ralph Peters is getting out of the trade clearing or processing and guaranteeing business after sustaining a multimillion dollar loss Friday options industry officials said .
Nearly 75 options traders on the Chicago Board Options Exchange who cleared trades through Petco including a handful of traders who lost between 500,000 to 1 million themselves as a result of Friday 's debacle are trying to transfer their business to other clearing firms CBOE members said .
Timothy Vincent Petco chief executive officer confirmed that Petco was withdrawing from the clearing business .
The owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business and after Monday they felt they did n't want to be exposed any more he said .
He added that Petco remained in compliance with all industry capital requirements during the market 's rapid plunge Friday and Monday 's rebound .
A CBOE spokeswoman declined comment on Petco .
Over the weekend Fossett Corp. another options trading firm transferred the clearing accounts of about 160 traders to First Options of Chicago a unit of Continental Bank Corp. because it could n't meet regulatory capital requirements after Friday 's market slide .
The unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry 's desire not to have its credibility tarnished by potentially widespread trading defaults on Monday .
The CBOE American Stock Exchange Options Clearing Corp. and Stephen Fossett owner of Fossett joined in putting up 50 million to guarantee the accounts at First Options .
The head of another small options clearing firm who asked not to be identified said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business .
Prior to the introduction of financial futures in the late 1970s most trading firms clustered around the LaSalle Street financial district here were family operations handed down from one generation to the next .
Most also were relatively undercapitalized compared with the size of most Wall Street securities firms .
Mr. Peters a LaSalle Street legend among the post-World War II generation of commodity traders was rumored to have amassed a multimillion-dollar fortune from commodity trading and other activities by the time he died in May .
Part of a Series Betty Lombardi is a mild-mannered homemaker and grandmother in rural Hunterdon County N.J .
But put her behind a shopping cart and she turns ruthless .
If Colgate toothpaste offers a tempting money-saving coupon she 'll cross Crest off her shopping list without a second thought .
Never mind that her husband prefers Crest .
Some weeks when her supermarket runs a double-coupon promotion she boasts that she shaves 22 off her bill .
Money is n't the only thing that makes her dump once favorite brands .
After she heard about the artery-clogging hazards of tropical oils in many cookies she dropped Pepperidge Farm and started buying brands free of such oils .
I always thought Pepperidge Farm was tasty and high quality Mrs. Lombardi says .
But I do n't want any of that oil for my grandkids .
Pepperidge Farm says it ca n't tell exactly how many customers it has lost but it hopes to remove the objectionable tropical oil from all its products by year end .
Clearly people like Mrs. Lombardi are giving marketers fits .
She represents a new breed of savvy consumer who puts bargain prices nutritional and environmental concerns and other priorities ahead of old-fashioned brand loyalty .
While brand loyalty is far from dead marketing experts say it has eroded during the 1980s .
Marketers themselves are partly to blame They 've increased spending for coupons and other short-term promotions at the expense of image-building advertising .
What 's more a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands many of which are virtually carbon copies of one other .
Marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use of promotions contends Joe Plummer an executive vice president at the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles ad agency .
Without some real product improvements it 's going to be difficult to win that loyalty back .
The Wall Street Journal 's American Way of Buying survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products they use .
For the survey Peter D. Hart Research Associates asked some 2,000 consumers including Mrs. Lombardi whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty .
More than half the users of 17 of the 25 products included in the survey said they 're brand switchers .
Overall 12 % of consumers are n't brand loyal for any of the 25 product categories .
About 47 % are loyal for one to five of the products .
Only 2 % are brand loyal in 16 to 20 of the categories and no one is loyal for more than 20 types of products .
For such products as canned vegetables and athletic shoes devotion to a single brand was quite low with fewer than 30 % saying they usually buy the same brand .
Only for cigarettes mayonnaise and toothpaste did more than 60 % of users say they typically stick with the same brand .
People tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive flavors such as cigarettes and ketchup .
Kathie Huff a respondent in the Journal survey from Spokane Wash. says her husband is adamant about eating only Hunt 's ketchup .
He simply ca n't stomach the taste of Heinz she says .
The 31-year-old homemaker adds The only other thing I 'm really loyal to is my Virginia Slims cigarettes .
Coke and Pepsi are all the same to me and I usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale .
Brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes perfume and beer .
People often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image its advertising conveys whether that 's macho Marlboro cigarettes or Cher 's Uninhibited perfume .
Loyalty lags most for utilitarian products like trash bags and batteries .
Only 23 % of trash-bag users in the Journal survey usually buy the same brand and just 29 % of battery buyers stick to one brand .
Underwear scored a middling 36 % in brand loyalty but consumer researchers say that 's actually quite high for such a mundane product .
In the past you just wore Fruit of the Loom and did n't care says Peter Kim U.S. director of consumer behavior research for the J. Walter Thompson ad agency .
The high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women .
He believes there 's opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty .
What loyalty there is to gas brands he believes is a matter of stopping at the most conveniently located service stations .
Brand loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the Journal survey .
Nearly one-fourth of participants age 60 and older claim brand loyalty for more than 10 of the 25 products in the survey only 9 % of those age 18 to 29 have such strong allegiance .
Higher-income people also tend to be more brand loyal these days the Journal survey and other research studies indicate .
Marketers speculate that more affluent people tend to lead more pressured lives and do n't have time to research the products they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price .
An established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality if not always the best value for the money .
It 's sort of loyalty by default .
Meanwhile the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal says Laurel Cutler vice chairman of the ad agency FCB\/Leber Katz Partners .
They 're buying whatever 's cheaper .
The biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game How those hotly pursued but highly unpredictable baby boomers will behave as they move into middle age .
They grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less allegiance so far .
But now that they 're settling down and raising families might they also show more stability in their brand choices .
Mr. Kim of J. Walter Thompson does n't think so .
He believes baby boomers will continue to be selective in their brand loyalties .
Earlier generations were brand loyal across categories he says but boomers tend to be brand loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled water but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances .
While not as brand loyal as in the past consumers today do n't buy products capriciously either .
Rather they tend to have a set of two or three favorites .
Sometimes they 'll choose Ragu spaghetti sauce other times it will be Prego .
Advertisers attribute this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands .
If a more absorbent Pampers hits the market you can be sure a new and improved Huggies wo n't be far behind .
The BBDO Worldwide ad agency studied brand parity and found that consumers believe all brands are about the same in a number of categories particularly credit cards paper towels dry soups and snack chips .
When there 's a clutter of brands consumers simplify the complexity by telling themselves All brands are the same so what difference does it make which I buy says Karen Olshan a senior vice president at BBDO .
Too often advertising imagery has n't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer .
But given such strong brand disloyalty some marketers are putting renewed emphasis on image advertising .
A small but growing number of companies are also trying to instill more fervent brand loyalty through such personalized direct-marketing ploys as catalogs magazines and membership clubs for brand users .
While discount promotions are essential for most brands some companies concede they went overboard in shifting money from advertising to coupons refunds and other sales incentives .
Some people argue that strong brands can afford to stop advertising for a time because of the residual impact of hundreds of millions of dollars spent on advertising through the years .
But most companies are too afraid to take that chance .
And perhaps with good reason .
Says Clayt Wilhite president of the D'Arcy Masius ad agency 's U.S. division Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly even for a powerful brand like Budweiser .
Consider for example what happened to Maxwell House coffee .
The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business .
But since returning to advertising Maxwell House has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival Folgers .
Now Philip Morris Kraft General Foods ' parent company is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House says Dick Mayer president of the General Foods USA division .
Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it .
Campbell Soup Co. for one has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands .
The probability of converting a non-user to your brand is about three in 1,000 says Tony Adams the company 's vice president for marketing research .
The best odds are with your core franchise .
Our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week and we 'd like to increase that .
So Campbell is talking to its brand enthusiasts probing their psychological attachment to its soup .
In one consumer focus group a fan declared that Campbell 's soup is like getting a hug from a friend .
That helped persuade the company to introduce a new advertising slogan A warm hug from Campbell 's .
Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week 's California earthquake .
Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month .
The earthquake 's toll including possible deep structural damage goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane says George Reider a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's claims division .
But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake coming so soon after the hurricane will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers .
Reflecting that logic insurance-company stocks posted strong gains .
Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage .
Most insurers already have mobilized their catastrophe teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern California .
Since commercial air travel is interrupted Aetna based in Hartford Conn. chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area .
About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon along with laptop computers cellular phones and blank checks .
Some adjusters already in other parts of California drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers .
Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers probably on the radio that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims .
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. the largest home and auto insurer in California believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the 475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo .
State Farm based in Bloomington Ind. is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California .
Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement rider on a homeowner 's policy in California because of the area 's vulnerability to earthquakes .
State Farm said about 25 % of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance .
Allstate Insurance Co. a unit of Sears Roebuck & Co. said about 23 % of its personal property policyholders about 28 % in the San Franciso area also have earthquake coverage .
The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated damage to residential property could total 500 million but only 100 million to 150 million is insured it said .
Officials from the American Insurance Association 's property-claim service division which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster will be flying to San Francisco today .
They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two .
Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage .
Highways such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland generally do n't have insurance coverage .
Industry officials say the Bay Bridge unlike some bridges has no earthquake coverage either so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds .
However the bridge which charges a 1 toll each way does have loss of income insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days .
That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman 's Fund Corp. based in Novato Calif. and Cigna Corp. based in Philadelphia .
Earthquake-related claims are n't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole .
Instead even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear .
Indeed the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways .
For example insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy .
Such increased demand for reinsurance along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise .
Reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves .
We are saying this is the breaking point this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace said William Yankus an analyst with Conning & Co. a Hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry .
His firm along with some others issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday .
Among the insurance stocks big gainers included American International Group up 3.25 to 102.625 General Re Corp. up 2.75 to 86.50 Aetna up 2.375 to 59.50 and Marsh & McLennan Inc. up 3.125 to 75.875 .
Still a few individual companies most likely smaller ones could be devastated .
I think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult .
He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo .
British West German Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster .
Although it 's unclear how much exposure the London market will face U.K. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to U.S. catastrophe coverage .
Jack Byrne chairman of Fireman 's Fund said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market causing these rates to soar .
The catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 when another earthquake sparked the Great San Francisco Fire .
Orin Kramer an insurance consultant in New York estimates that the 1906 San Francisco destruction on an inflation-adjusted basis included insured losses of 5.8 billion .
He is estimating this week 's disaster will generate insured losses of 2 billion to 4 billion following about 4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo .
Silicon Graphics Inc. 's first-quarter profit rose sharply to 5.2 million or 28 cents a share from 1 million or six cents a share a year ago .
The maker of computer workstations said a surge of government orders contributed to the increase .
Revenue rose 95 % to 86.4 million from 44.3 million the year earlier .
In national over-the-counter trading the company closed yesterday at 23.25 a share down 25 cents .
Hunter Environmental Services Inc. said it reached a preliminary accord on the sale of its environmental consulting and services business for about 40 million and assumption of related debt .
The buyer was n't identified .
The company said it also is making progress in negotiating the buy-out of its design division by management .
In addition Hunter said it will use proceeds from a private placement of 8 million of preferred shares to purchase an interest in a start-up company to underwrite environmental impairment insurance .
Hunter wants to concentrate its resources on the insurance business and on a project to store hazardous wastes in salt domes .
Jaguar PLC 's chairman said he hopes to reach a friendly pact with General Motors Corp. within a month that may involve the British luxury-car maker 's producing a cheaper executive model .
Sir John Egan told reporters at London 's Motorfair yesterday he would be disappointed if we could n't do the deal within a month .
He said the tie-up would mean Jaguar could develop cars down range in price from where we are by offering access to GM 's high-volume parts production .
Besides creating joint manufacturing ventures the accord is expected to give GM about a 15 % stake that eventually would rise to about 30 % .
Jaguar figures a friendly alliance with GM will fend off unwelcome advances from Ford Motor Co .
But Ford Jaguar 's biggest shareholder since lifting its stake to 10.4 % this week is pressing harder for talks with Sir John .
We 're getting to the point where we are going to have to meet with him one Ford official said yesterday .
Ford probably will renew its request for such a meeting soon he added .
Sir John has spurned Ford 's advances since the U.S. auto giant launched a surprise bid for as much as 15 % of Jaguar last month .
Ford has signaled it might acquire a majority interest later .
I 'm not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody the Jaguar chairman asserted yesterday .
He did n't rule out negotiations with Ford however .
The fiercely proud but financially strapped British company prefers to remain independent and publicly held despite Ford 's promise of access to cash and technological know-how .
Sir John noted that GM a longtime Jaguar supplier agrees we should remain an independent company .
He said Jaguar started negotiating with GM and several other car makers over a year ago but the rest dropped by the wayside ever since the share price went above 4 6.30 a share .
Jaguar shares stood at 405 pence before Ford 's initial announcement but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up .
The stock traded late yesterday on London 's stock exchange at 673 pence up 19 pence .
Developing an executive-model range would mark a major departure for Britain 's leading luxury-car maker .
A typical British executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car .
It generally fetches no more than 25,000 39,400 roughly 16,000 less than the highest-priced Jaguars which are all known for their hand-crafted leather work .
We have designs for such executive cars but have never been able to develop them Sir John said .
GM 's help would make it possible for Jaguar to build a wider range of cars .
An executive model would significantly boost Jaguar 's yearly output of 50,000 cars .
You are talking about a couple hundred thousand a year said Bob Barber an auto-industry analyst at U.K. brokerage James Capel & Co .
A pact with GM may emerge in as little as two weeks according to sources close to the talks .
The deal would require approval by a majority of Jaguar shareholders .
We have to make it attractive enough that holders would accept it Sir John said .
That may be difficult the Jaguar chairman acknowledged when you have somebody else breathing down your neck .
Ford probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from U.S. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later said Stephen Reitman European auto analyst at London brokers UBS Phillips & Drew .
Ford ca n't make a full-fledged bid for Jaguar until U.K. government restrictions expire .
The anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15 % of Jaguar shares without permission until Dec. 31 1990 .
But with its 10.4 % stake Ford can convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely .
It 's a very valuable weapon in their armory which could enable Ford to bid sooner for Jaguar observed Mr. Barber of James Capel .
Otherwise Jaguar may have to tolerate the two U.S. auto giants each owning a 15 % stake for more than a year .
It would be difficult to see how a car company can be owned by a collective Sir John said .
It has never been done before but there 's always a first .
Although two Baby Bells showed strong growth in access lines usage and unregulated business revenue one reported a modest gain in third-quarter net while the other posted a small drop .
Ameritech Corp. 's earnings increased 2.8 % after strong revenue gains were offset somewhat by refunds and rate reductions imposed by regulators in its Midwest territory .
BellSouth Corp. 's third-quarter earnings dropped 3.8 % as a result of debt refinancing the recent acquisition of a cellular and paging property and rate reductions in its Southeast territory .
BellSouth At BellSouth based in Atlanta customer access lines grew by 162,000 or 3.5 % during the 12-month period ended Sept .
For the third quarter total operating revenue grew 2.6 % to 3.55 billion from 3.46 billion .
Total operating expenses increased 3.5 % to 2.78 billion from 2.69 billion .
Overall access minutes of use increased 10.3 % and toll messages jumped 5.2 % .
BellSouth Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John L. Clendenin said three factors accounted for the drop in third-quarter earnings .
The refinancing of 481 million in long-term debt reduced net income by 22 million or five cents a share but in the long run will save more than 250 million in interest costs .
The company previously said that the recent acquisition of Mobile Communications Corp. of America would dilute 1989 earnings by about 3 % .
In addition earnings were reduced by rate reductions in Florida Kentucky Alabama Tennessee and Louisiana .
Ameritech At Ameritech based in Chicago customer access lines increased by 402,000 or 2.6 % and cellular mobile lines increased by 80,000 or 62.3 % for the 12-month period ended Sept. 30 .
For the third quarter revenue increased 1.9 % to 2.55 billion from 2.51 billion .
Operating expenses increased 2.6 % to 2.04 billion including one-time pretax charges of 40 million for labor contract signing bonuses .
Local service revenue increased 3.5 % and directory and unregulated business revenue jumped 9.5 % .
But network access revenue dropped 4 % and toll revenue dropped 1.4 % .

The Wall Street Journal American Way of Buying Survey consists of two separate door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization .
The two surveys which asked different questions were conducted using national random probability samples .
The poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30 1989 .
The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 1989 .
Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data .
For each poll the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the U.S. using the same questionnaire the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1\/2 percentage points in either direction .
The margin of error for subgroups for example married women with children at home would be larger .
In addition in any survey there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings .
Program traders were buying and selling at full steam Monday the first trading session after the stock market 's 190.58-point plunge Friday .
They accounted for a hefty 16 % of New York Stock Exchange volume Monday the fourth busiest session ever .
On Friday 13 % of volume was in computer-guided program trades .
In August by contrast program trading averaged 10.3 % of daily Big Board turnover .
Program traders were publicly castigated following the 508-point crash Oct. 19 1987 and a number of brokerage firms pulled back from using this strategy for a while .
But as the outcry faded by the spring of 1988 they resumed .
Some observers thought that after Friday 's sharp drop the firms would rein in their program traders to avoid stoking more controversy .
But the statistics released yesterday show the firms did nothing of the sort .
One reason they said was that the official reports on the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a cause .
Stock-index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it accelerates market moves if not actually causing them .
In it traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies .
Under the exchange 's definitions program trading also describes a number of other strategies that in the opinion of some traders do n't cause big swings in the market .
The Big Board 's disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual .
Though it collects such data daily its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends .
The September figures are due to be released this week .
The Big Board declined to name the Wall Street firms involved in the activity Friday and Monday or the type of strategies used .
But traders on the exchange floor who can observe the computer-guided trading activity on monitor screens said most of the top program-trading firms were active both days .
Through August the top five program trading firms in volume were Morgan Stanley & Co. Kidder Peabody & Co. Merrill Lynch & Co. PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc .
Though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record .
Besides reciting the pardon for program trading contained in the Brady Commission report they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed Monday to restore the markets ' equilibrium .
On Friday the stock-index futures market was unhinged from the stock market when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange halted trading in Standard & Poor 's 500 futures contract a circuit breaker procedure instituted after the 1987 crash and implemented for the first time .
Futures trading resumed a half-hour later but the session ended shortly thereafter leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs traders said .
By Monday morning they said stock-index arbitrage sell programs helped re-establish the link between stocks and futures .
But stunning volatility was produced in the process .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged a breathtaking 63.52 points in the first 40 minutes of trading Monday as stock-index arbitrage sell programs kicked in .
At about 10:10 a.m. EDT the market abruptly turned upward on stock-index arbitrage buy programs .
By day 's end the Dow industrials had rebounded 88.12 points or nearly half of Friday 's drop .
FREDERICK 'S OF HOLLYWOOD Inc. Los Angeles said its board voted a 50 % increase in the specialty boutique-store operator 's semiannual dividend to five cents a common share .
The dividend is payable Dec. 15 to stock of record Nov. 15 .
Valley National Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of 72.2 million or 3.65 a share and suspended its quarterly dividend because of potential losses on its Arizona real estate holdings .
The Phoenix-based holding company for Arizona 's largest bank said it added 121 million to its allowance for losses on loans and for real estate owned .
The company earned 18.7 million or 95 cents a share a year earlier .
For the nine months Valley National posted a net loss of 136.4 million or 6.90 a share .
It had profit of 48.6 million or 2.46 a share in the 1988 period .
Valley National had been paying a quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share .
The Arizona real estate market continues to be depressed and there is still uncertainty as to when values will recover James P. Simmons chairman said .
The decision to increase the loan-loss reserve and suspend the dividend is both prudent and in the best long-term interest of the shareholders he said .
Valley National said it made the decision on the basis of an overall assessment of the marketplace and the condition of its loan portfolio and after reviewing it with federal regulators .
The addition to reserves comes on top of a provision of 199.7 million that was announced in June .
In July Moody 's downgraded 400 million of the company 's debt saying the bank holding company had n't taken adequate write-offs against potential losses on real estate loans despite its second-quarter write-down .
Richard M. Greenwood Valley National 's executive vice president said then that the company believed the write-downs were adequate and did n't plan to increase its reserves again .
Bruce Hoyt a banking analyst with Boettcher & Co. a Denver brokerage firm said Valley National is n't out of the woods yet .
The key will be whether Arizona real estate turns around or at least stabilizes he said .
They 've stepped up to the plate to take the write-downs but when markets head down a company is always exposed to further negative surprises Mr. Hoyt said .
Valley National closed yesterday at 24.25 a share down 1 in national over-the-counter trading .
Two years of coddling down the drain .
That 's the way a lot of brokers feel today on the second anniversary of the 1987 stock-market crash .
Ever since that fearful Black Monday they 've been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors trying to convince them that Oct. 19 1987 was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place for average Americans to put their hard-earned dollars .
And until last Friday it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off .
Some of those folks were coming back says Leslie Quick Jr. chairman of discount brokers Quick & Reilly Group Inc .
We had heard from people who had n't been active for a long time .
Then came the frightening 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a new wave of stock-market volatility .
All of a sudden it was back to square one .
It 's going to set things back for a period because it reinforces the concern of volatility says Jeffrey B. Lane president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
I think it will shake confidence one more time and a lot of this business is based on client confidence .
Brokers around the country say the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost eerie .
Customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post-crash 1987 .
The kinds of questions you had before have resurfaced says Raymond A. Chip Mason chairman of regional brokerage firm Legg Mason Inc. Baltimore .
I can just tell the questions are right back where they were What 's going on .
Ca n't anything be done about program trading .
Does n't the exchange understand .
Where is the SEC on this .
Mr. Mason says he 's convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks even though they believe the deck is stacked against them .
But these wide swings scare them to death .
All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynch & Co. that have big retail or individual-investor businesses .
After expanding rapidly during the bull-market years up to the 1987 crash retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead .
True the amount of money investors are willing to entrust to their brokers has been growing lately .
But those dollars have been going into such safe products as money market funds which do n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms .
At discount brokerage Charles Schwab & Co. such cash-equivalent investments recently accounted for a record 8 billion of the firm 's 25 billion of client 's assets .
The brokers ' hope has been that they could soon coax investors into shifting some of their hoard into the stock market .
And before last Friday they were actually making modest progress .
A slightly higher percentage of New York Stock Exchange volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash 1988 according to Securities Industry Association data .
In 1987 an average 19.7 % of Big Board volume was retail business with the monthly level never more than 21.4 % .
The retail participation dropped
