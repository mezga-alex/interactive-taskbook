 to an average 18.2 % in 1988 and shriveled to barely 14 % some months during the year .
Yet in 1989 retail participation has been more than 20 % in every month and was 23.5 % in August the latest month for which figures are available .
Jeffrey Schaefer the SIA 's research director says that all of his group 's retail-volume statistics could be overstated by as much as five percentage points because corporate buy-backs are sometimes inadvertently included in Big Board data .
But there did seem to be a retail activity pickup .
But Friday did n't help things says Mr. Schaefer .
With the gyrations of recent days says Hugo Quackenbush senior vice president at Charles Schwab many small investors are absolutely convinced that they should n't play in the stock market .
Joseph Grano president of retail sales and marketing at PaineWebber Group Inc. still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market .
Investors will develop thicker skins and their confidence will return he says .
Friday 's plunge he is telling PaineWebber brokers was nothing more than a tremendous reaction to leveraged buy-out stocks .
Meanwhile PaineWebber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving Wall Street their money .
It 's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets rather than push the investor to move into specific products such as equities Mr. Grano says .
The equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there 's a semblance of confidence .
It could be a long wait say some industry observers .
Some investors will tiptoe back in says Richard Ross a market research director for Elrick & Lavidge in Chicago .
Then there 'll be another swing .
Given enough of these this will drive everyone out except the most hardy he adds .
Mr. Ross who has been studying retail investors ' perception of risks in the brokerage industry said a market plunge like Friday 's shatters investors confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market .
The long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is miserable Mr. Ross declares .

John V. Holmes an investment-newsletter publisher and three venture-capital firms he organized were enjoined from violating the registration provisions of the securities laws governing investment companies .
As part of an agreement that settled charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission a receiver was also appointed for the three venture-capital firms .
Mr. Holmes was the subject of a page one profile in The Wall Street Journal in 1984 after the SEC questioned him about ties between him and companies he touted in a newsletter .
In 1986 in another consent agreement with the SEC Mr. Holmes was enjoined from violating the stock-registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws .
Without any admission or denial of guilt by Mr. Holmes that agreement settled SEC charges that Mr. Holmes sold unregistered securities and misled investors .
In charges filed last week in federal district court in Charlotte N.C. the SEC alleged that Venture Capitalists Inc. Venture Finance Corp. and New Ventures Fund Inc. all of Charlotte failed repeatedly to file proper documents .
The SEC also charged that Mr. Holmes acted as an officer or director of New Ventures in violation of his previous consent agreement .
Some companies were delinquent in filings and other actions all of which cost money Mr. Holmes said .
Two of Mr. Holmes 's business associates who worked for Venture Capitalists Kimberly Ann Smith and Frederick Byrum also consented to being enjoined from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws .
Ms. Smith also agreed to a permanent injunction barring her from acting as an officer director or investment adviser of any mutual fund unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company .
Mr. Byrum and Ms. Smith could n't be reached for comment .
In consenting to the injunctions none of the individuals or companies admitted or denied the allegations .
Senate Republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for individuals and corporations .
At the same time a small group of Senate Democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon .
Sen. Bob Packwood R. Ore. the lead sponsor of the GOP proposal said he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along particularly this month 's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit .
He gave 10-to-1 odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year though it probably wo n't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill .
He added that he expects to talk to the Democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal .
For individuals the Packwood plan would exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year .
The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35 % .
The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 1989 .
As an alternative he said taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index .
For corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % .
That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years .
The Packwood plan would also include a proposal designed by Sen. William Roth R. Del. that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts .
The Roth plan would create a new non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses .
Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax .
For their part the group of Democrats are working on a plan that like the Packwood proposal would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies .
Newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held .
An extra exclusion would be given to long-held stock in small and medium-size corporations just starting up .
No one in the Senate is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the House .
That plan would provide a 30 % exclusion to assets sold over a 2 1\/2-year period ending Dec. 31 1991 .
After then the House measure would boost the tax rate to 28 % and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation .
Senators are focusing on making a capital-gains differential permanent .
Separately Chairman Dan Rostenkowski D. Ill .
of the House Ways and Means Committee said he did n't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit .
The current debt limit expires Oct. 31 .
He also urged House and Senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit including the House-passed capital-gains provision .
From a helicopter a thousand feet above Oakland after the second-deadliest earthquake in U.S. history a scene of devastation emerges a freeway crumbled into a concrete sandwich hoses pumping water into once-fashionable apartments abandoned autos .
But this quake was n't the big one the replay of 1906 that has been feared for so many years .
Despite the tragic loss of more than 270 lives and damage estimated in the billions most businesses and their plants and offices in the Bay area were n't greatly affected .
The economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two although some transportation problems may last weeks or months .
A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland .
Also the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage .
The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage broken windows falling brick and cornices buckled asphalt or sidewalks .
Of course the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's capital of high technology .
Like other major American cities the San Francisco Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors .
When the tremors struck the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air .
Michael L. Bandler vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co. says nearly all the network 's computer switches which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another changed to battery power when the city lost power .
The battery packs have enough power for only three hours but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel .
Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell 's network only four went down .
One of those was in Hollister Calif. near the earthquake 's epicenter .
Few telephone lines snapped .
That 's because the widely used fiber-optic cable has been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points .
The slack absorbs the pulling strain generated by an earthquake .
Nevertheless phone service was sporadic many computer terminals remained dark and by late yesterday a third of San Francisco remained without power .
Business in the nation 's fourth-largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home .
The economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself as virtually all businesses shut down .
The 125-billion-a-year Bay area economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation 's most populous state and accounts for 2 % to 3 % of the nation 's total output of goods and services according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto .
In high-tech the Bay area accounts for 15 % to 20 % of the U.S. computer-related industry .
This has been a major disruption for the Bay area economy says Pauline Sweezey the chief economist at the California Department of Finance .
Obviously things are going to have to go on hold for many companies .
The damage to the Bay area 's roadways could cause significant economic hardship .
A quarter of a million people cross the Bay Bridge every day far more than the 100,000 that use the Bay Area Rapid Transit system BART which was working but was n't stopping in the city 's Financial District yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being checked for gas leaks .
California state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless do n't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the Bay area .
All major roadways except Interstate 880 known as the Nimitz Freeway and the Bay Bridge were open by 1 p.m. yesterday .
Officials expect difficulty routing traffic through downtown San Francisco .
The earthquake caused many streets to buckle and crack making them impassible .
Other roads were obstructed by collapsed buildings and damaged water and power lines an emergency relief spokesman says .
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated the damage to his city alone at 2 billion .
But many predicted that the commercial disruption would be short-lived .
Of the scores of companies contacted by this newspaper few reported any damage that they did n't expect to have remedied within a day or two .
It is possible of course that some of the most seriously damaged companies could n't be reached particularly in areas nearest the epicenter .
Typical perhaps was the situation at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. the General Motors Corp.-Toyota joint-venture auto plant in Fremont about 35 miles south of Oakland .
Ten of the plant 's workers were injured when the quake hit about a half-hour into the afternoon shift seven were hospitalized .
Metal racks on the plant floor fell over and water mains ruptured a spokeswoman says .
The plant was evacuated and workers sent home .
But the plant was able to resume limited production of its Toyota Corollas and Geo Prizms by 6 a.m. yesterday and absenteeism was only 7 % of the work force about twice normal .
Computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. based in Palo Alto says one of its buildings sustained severe damage when it was knocked off its foundation .
Other buildings had broken glass dangling light fixtures and broken pipes a spokesperson says estimating the cost of reconstruction in the millions .
Most banks were closed but were expected to reopen today with few problems anticipated .
At the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Vice President Robert Fienberg says operations were steaming along as usual yesterday afternoon .
When the quake hit we turned on our emergency generator and brought our computers up he says .
The Fed serves as a middleman for banks taking checks from one bank and sending them to another an operation that it handled smoothly Tuesday night after the quake .
The volume we received from the banks was a lot lower than usual he says .
A disaster-contingency plan in which the Los Angeles Fed would come to San Francisco 's aid was n't needed he adds .
Most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from congestion .
The telephone network simply could n't handle the large number of people seeking to make a call at the same time .
The volume resulted in dial-tone delays that were as short as 15 seconds and as long as five minutes .
Mr. Bandler puts traffic volume at 10 to 50 times normal .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. MCI Communications Inc. and United Telecommunications ' U S Sprint unit were blocking phone calls into the Bay area to alleviate congestion .
The companies block traffic much as highway on-ramps are blocked when traffic backs up .
William E. Downing Pacific Bell 's vice president of customer services for the Bay area says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50 % of all calls .
Pacific Telesis says its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50 % of its calls locally .
Ironically the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area 's economic fortunes and indeed the nation 's gross national product .
It may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such as double-deck highways .
It would in the near-term give a boost to the San Francisco economy because there will be an influx of people to help says Beth Burnham Mace a regional economist at DRI\/McGraw Hill a Lexington Mass. forecasting firm .
The construction industry is sure to feel increased demand .
There will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state federal and local employment Ms. Mace says .
Adds Stacy Kotman an economist at Georgia State University There 's nothing positive about an earthquake but it will probably generate more construction activity .
Wall Street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies .
Shares of Lone Star Industries Inc. a cement maker rose sharply in anticipation of stepped-up demand .
In Greenwich Conn. Lone Star spokesman Michael London says Obviously with an earthquake of this size there are likely to be construction projects that would n't otherwise have been anticipated .
But any increase is n't likely to be any kind of a surge .
It 's something likely to be spread out over a long period of time .
There will be a lot of repair work that wo n't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new constructon would .
Lone Star 's San Francisco facilities were n't damaged in the quake .
The earthquake is likely to reduce GNP negligibly in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins .
The first effects are of course negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending .
Corporate profits may also dip initially .
Many of the lost tourism dollars wo n't be recovered many trips delayed never take place .
Subsequently however the ill effects are likely to be offset at least in economic terms as construction activity begins .
Because of the way the government keeps its books the damage to the Bay Bridge however costly wo n't be counted as a minus .
The money spent on repairs will be counted as a plus .
It 's very difficult to model the long-term impact of this says Andrew Goldberg who studies the public-policy and crisis-management aspects of earthquakes at the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington D.C .
You certainly can say it 's going to be extremely severe .
We really are talking about shutting down a major American city for a number of days maybe for a few weeks .
Mr. Goldberg says the cost of the earthquake will definitely top 1 billion and could reach 4 billion .
He cautions that early damage estimates are often low the damage totals in Hurricane Hugo increased tenfold as more information was received .
The earthquake damage of course would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown San Francisco .
A direct hit on a major city Mr. Goldberg figures would cause 20 billion to 40 billion of damage .
Experts caution that it is far too soon for reliable estimates of the quake 's total damage but it 's clear that insurers are likely to pay out enormous sums .
Jack Byrne the chairman of Fireman 's Fund Corp. which is based in Novato Calif. estimates insured losses resulting the earthquake could total 2 billion .
The impact on the insurance industry will be big and harsh but less than Hurricane Hugo says Mr. Byrne who toured the Bay area by car yesterday afternoon to get a sense of the company 's exposure to the earthquake .
Mr. Byrne says Fireman 's Fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims but after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines the company 's fourthquarter charge against earnings should n't top 50 million .
The company was able to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized maps of Northern California showing the exact locations of all the property it insures .
Fireman 's Fund had claims adjusters on the streets of San Francisco right after sunrise yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot .
Fireman 's Fund insures 37,300 homes and autos and 35,000 businesses in the Bay area .
In addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage the insurer must cover worker-compensation claims and also losses due to businesses being shut down by lack of power or phone service .
But many Californians may not have adequate insurance coverage to pay for damages to their property .
The Independent Insurance Agents of America says fewer than one of every five California homeowners has earthquake insurance .
A somewhat higher percentage of people living in the Bay area have bought the additional insurance protection but the great majority are n't covered .
Earthquake insurance typically runs 200 or more a year for a small house .
Whatever the long-term economic effect the scene from the helicopter above Oakland is one of tragedy .
Gargantuan sections of a double-decker freeway have been heaved about like plastic building blocks .
Atop them sit cars and trucks abandoned in a terrifying scramble to safety the day before .
In areas where the freeway made giant concrete sandwiches of itself lie cars that police say have been flattened into foot-thick slabs .
On the periphery rescue workers seem from the air to move in slow motion .
They peck away at the 1 1\/2-mile section of rubble searching for more of the 250 people thought to have died here .
About 20 other deaths were also attributed to the earthquake .
The heart of the earthquake 6.9 on the Richter scale was 50 miles to the south near Santa Cruz but its terrible fist struck here on the Nimitz Freeway a major artery serving the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco .
Along the way the quake toppled a mall in Santa Cruz knocked down buildings in San Francisco 's fashionable Marina District and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city 's Financial District .
Just a short span across the bay to the west the quake also showed its mettle A four-square-block area of the Marina District lies smoldering under a steady stream of seawater being pumped onto rubble to prevent it from blazing anew .
Many of the buildings mostly condominiums and apartments were flattened almost instantly as the underlying soil much of it landfill was literally turned to ooze by the quake 's intensive shaking rupturing gas lines .
Onlookers say three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fireball shortly after the quake struck .
Efforts to fight the blaze were hampered because water mains were severed as well .
From the air ribbons of yellow fire hose carry water from the bay to high-pressure nozzles trained on the site .
As onlookers stand behind barricades helmeted firemen and building inspectors survey rows of nearby buildings that were twisted from their foundations and seem on the verge of collapse .
In the Marina District residents spent yesterday assessing damage cleaning up and trying to find friends and neighbors .
Evelyn Boccone 85 years old has lived in the district most of her life .
Her parents lost everything in the 1906 earthquake .
Now we realize what our mothers must have gone through she says .
We always heard about the earthquake but as children we did n't always listen .
PRINCE HENRI is the crown prince and hereditary grand duke of Luxembourg .
An article in the World Business Report of Sept. 22 editions incorrectly referred to his father Grand Duke Jean as the crown prince .
Resolution Funding Corp. plans to sell 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday in the agency 's first sale of securities .
The new bonds will be dated Oct. 30 and mature Oct. 15 2019 .
Tenders for the bonds available in minimum denominations of 1,000 must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Wednesday at Federal Reserve banks .
Refcorp created by the thrift-overhaul law enacted in August will use the proceeds to merge or sell off ailing savings-and-loan institutions .
Congress authorized 50 billion to be borrowed to pay for the thrift bailout .
Of that amount 20 billion has already been borrowed by the Treasury Department .
Unless otherwise specified in a particular offer the bonds wo n't be subject to redemption prior to maturity .
Interest payments on the bonds will be payable semiannually .
The bonds are subject to federal taxation in the U.S. including income taxes .
At the state and local level the bonds are subject to surtaxes and estate inheritance and gift taxes but exempt from taxation as to principal and interest .
G.D. Searle & Co. a Monsanto Co. unit is launching a program to give consumers more information about its drugs when doctors prescribe them .
Called Patients in the Know the program features fact sheets designed to be easy to understand .
The sheets tell how the medicine works describe how to use it and list its possible side effects .
They are designed to be given to patients by their doctors when the medicines are prescribed and include space for the doctor to write special instructions .
In addition Searle will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores .
Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients .
We believe that every drug that 's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label said Douglas Teich of the Public Citizen Health Research Group a Ralph Nader affiliate .
Dr. Teich said Searle is the only company I know that voluntarily will make consumer information available .
According to federal officials and drug-industry studies nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year are n't used properly meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication .
We think it 's very important to provide as much information as possible on the drugs consumers take said Searle Chairman Sheldon Gilgore .
Bond prices rambled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply .
Early yesterday bonds rose as investors rushed to buy Treasury securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive California earthquake .
For example some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies which face massive damage claims would get hit hard .
But when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose instead bonds drifted lower .
With stocks not a major focus we 're waiting for the next guiding light said Brian J. Fabbri chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities Inc .
If the stock market tremors are behind us then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine where interest rates are heading .
The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond which jumped 3\/8 point or about 3.75 for each 1,000 face amount during the first hour of trading ended little changed .
Interest rates barely budged from Tuesday 's levels .
Most junk bonds which have been battered in recent weeks continued a slow recuperation and ended unchanged to slightly higher .
But some so-called high-quality junk issues fell as some mutual funds sold their most liquid issues to raise cash .
RJR Holdings Capital Corp. 's 14.7 % bonds due 2009 fell one point .
Other RJR issues fell between 1\/2 point and 1 1\/2 point .
In the latest sign of how difficult it is to place certain junk bonds Continental Airlines said it was forced to scale back the size of its latest offering .
Continental a unit of Texas Air Corp. slashed the size of its note offering from 150 million to 71 million .
The move had been widely expected .
In the multipart offering the company sold a portion of secured notes but shelved all the unsecured notes .
A Continental spokeswoman said the notes may be offered at a later date .
This was not a do-or-die deal she said .
I think this is a market that required some level of security .
It did not make sense to offer unsecured paper in an unsettling market .
Investors have been speculating for weeks about the market 's ability to place the 7 billion to 10 billion of new junk bonds scheduled to be sold by year end .
Supply troubles were also on the minds of Treasury investors yesterday who worried about the flood of new government securities coming next week .
We 're being bombarded by new Treasury and agency debt offerings said William Sullivan Jr. director of money-market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .
The market is concerned about its ability to underwrite all this debt at current levels .
In addition to the 15.6 billion of Treasury bills to be sold at next week 's regular Monday auction the government will sell 10 billion of new two-year Treasury notes .
And Resolution Funding Corp. said late yesterday that it will sell 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday .
Refcorp is the financing unit of Resolution Trust Corp. a new government agency created to rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts .
Its securities have been dubbed bailout bonds by traders .
In when-issued trading the two-year Treasurys had a yield of about 7.88 % .
In the municipal market all eyes were on California debt as investors tried to gauge the financial ramifications of Tuesday 's earthquake .
But traders said the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of California state and local municipal debt .
There are certain bonds traders refer to as earthquake bonds because the issuers are on top of the San Andreas fault said Zane Mann editor of the California Municipal Bond Advisor a newsletter for investors .
Since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield an extra premium for the earthquake risk they were n't materially affected .
But some bond market analysts said that could quickly change if property casualty insurance companies scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise cash to pay damage claims .
Insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct San Francisco said Charles Lieberman chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp .
He also expects the performance of municipals to lag Treasurys as California is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities .
A report issued late yesterday by Standard & Poor 's Corp. concluded the quake wo n't cause wide-scale credit deterioration for issuers and debt issues in the 12-county area of Northern California affected by the quake .
Treasury Securities Treasury bonds ended narrowly mixed in quiet trading .
The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 100 29\/32 to yield 8.03 % compared with 100 28\/32 to yield 8.04 % Tuesday .
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at a price of 99 26\/32 to yield 8 % compared with 99 25\/32 to yield 8.01 % .
Short-term rates were little changed .
Corporate Issues Investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1\/4 point lower .
The Continental junk bond offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was the only new issue priced yesterday .
In the four-part offering the 71 million of secured equipment certificates was priced to yield 13.75 % to 15.75 % .
Municipals Municipal bonds ended about 1\/8 to 3\/8 point lower hurt by the circulation of two bid-wanted lists totaling 655 million .
Chemical Securities Inc. is acting as agent for the seller .
Meanwhile some California issues were down a touch more than the broad market but traders said there had n't been much investor selling because of the quake .
But New York City general obligation bonds came under selling pressure .
Traders said a steady stream of bonds was put up for sale yesterday pushing yields for longer maturities up 0.05 percentage point .
Traders said investors were reacting to recent negative news on the city 's finances and are nervous ahead of the Nov. 7 election .
Washington D.C. topped the competitive slate yesterday with a sale of 200 million of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes .
In late trading New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was off 1\/4 point at 98 bid .
The yield was 7.35 % up 0.01 percentage point .
Mortgage-Backed Securities Mortgage securities ended little changed after light dealings .
There was no appreciable market impact from the California earthquake .
Dealers said there was some concern that insurance companies might be forced to sell mortgage securities to help pay earthquake-related claims but no selling materialized .
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage Association two dominant issuers of mortgage securities have a sizable amount of California home loans in their mortgagebacked pools .
But their potential quake exposure is seen as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans they purchase .
And because Northern California home prices are so high loans from the region often are too large to be included in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae pools .
Meanwhile Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery ended at 97 29\/32 unchanged .
Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 4\/32 down 1\/32 .
In derivative markets Fannie Mae issued two 400 million real estate mortgage investment conduits backed by its 9 % securities .
Foreign Bonds British government bonds or gilts ended moderately lower as equities there recovered from Tuesday 's drop .
The Treasury 's 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 fell 11\/32 to 111 31\/32 to yield 10.08 % while the 12 % notes due 1995 were down 7\/32 to 103 22\/32 to yield 11.04 % .
Traders said today may be an anxious day for the market .
Several key economic figures are due out and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson is scheduled to give the annual Mansion House address to the financial community .
The chancellor sometimes has used the occasion to announce major economic policy changes .
Economists do n't expect any such changes in this year 's address given Mr. Lawson 's apparent reluctance to adjust policy currently .
Meanwhile Japanese government bonds retreated in quiet trading stymied by the dollar 's resiliency .
Japan 's bellwether 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at 95.75 to yield 5.315 % .
In West Germany investors stayed on the sidelines as the bond market searched for direction .
The government 's 7 % issue due October 1999 fell 0.05 point to 99.90 to yield 7.01 % .
The Berlin Wall still stands .
But the man who built it has fallen .
East Germany yesterday removed Erich Honecker one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens .
But while it was a move that stunned the East bloc it hardly ushers in an era of reform at least anytime soon .
For the Politburo replaced Mr. Honecker who had led East Germany for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus with a man cut of the same cloth Egon Krenz the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime Honecker protege .
East Germany it is clear is no Poland where the Communist Party now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union .
Nor is it a Hungary where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the Communist nation into a multiparty democracy .
Still any change in East Germany has enormous implications for both East and West .
It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow Washington and Western Europe .
Mr. Krenz 52 was named the new party chief just minutes after the Party 's 163-member Central Committee convened in East Berlin .
Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for health reasons West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday .
Mr. Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media .
ADN said Mr. Honecker a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military .
Mr. Krenz is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation 's parliament convenes later this week .
Mr. Honecker 's ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron-handed leadership during which Mr. Honecker now 77 years old built East Germany into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc .
His grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his countrymen dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule fled to the West .
Thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in East Germany 's largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers ' uprising in 1953 .
In Washington the Bush administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change .
The official line was to offer warmer ties to Mr. Krenz provided he is willing to institute reforms .
But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer .
President Bush told reporters Whether that the leadership change reflects a change in East-West relations I do n't think so .
Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker .
One top U.S. expert on East Germany added There is no clear-cut champion of reform that we know of in the East German leadership .
Indeed Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups .
He said while dialogue is important enough forums already exist in which different interests can express themselves .
The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party .
According to West German government sources Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change .
But with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity Mr. Honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle officials say .
Those allies included Politburo members Guenter Mittag who has long headed economic affairs and Joachim Hermann chief of information policy .
Both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday .
Although other resignations may follow it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change .
Clearly the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz .
Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland he was eight years old when World War II ended .
Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany 's division .
Since joining the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member Mr. Krenz had acquired the nickname crown prince a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. Honecker .
In fact the two men have had strikingly similar career paths both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position .
Moreover both men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy .
Notably one of Mr. Krenz 's few official visits overseas came a few months ago when he visited China after the massacre in Beijing .
He later defended the Chinese government 's response during a separate visit to West Germany .
East German Protestantism in particular fears Mr. Krenz in part because of an incident in January 1988 when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who had sought refuge in the Church .
However Mr. Krenz also has a reputation for being politically savvy .
His shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in East Germany is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor Mr. Honecker .
Indeed according to West German government sources he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled Mr. Honecker .
In recent days Mr. Krenz has sought to project a kinder image .
According to a report widely circulating in East Berlin it was Mr. Krenz who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in Leipzig .
He does n't want to have the image of the gun man says Fred Oldenburg an expert at the Bonn-sponsored Institute of East European and International Studies in Cologne .
He 's not a reformer he wants to have the image of a reformer .
As part of his image polishing Mr. Krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party 's authority .
Besides sacking other senior Politburo officials who allied themselves with Mr. Honecker Mr. Krenz could loosen controls on the news media free up travel restrictions and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups .
But will it be enough .
West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful .
He does n't signify what people want so the unrest will go on Mr. Oldenburg predicts .
At the same time the expectations of the East German people are great and will continue to grow .
Says one West German official What 's necessary now is the process of democratization .
Not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously .
Chancellor Kohl meanwhile has invited Mr. Krenz to open discussions with Bonn on a wide range of subjects .
Reports in the West German press citing sources in East Germany suggest Mr. Krenz may serve only as a bridge between Mr. Honecker and a genuine reform leader .
Adding to that speculation is Mr. Krenz 's reputation as a heavy drinker who is said to also suffer from diabetes .
This is a dynamic process and we 're experiencing the first step the Bonn official adds .
The selection of Mr. Krenz may also disappoint Moscow .
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has pressed hard for a change in East Germany 's rigid stance .
Two reform-minded party leaders favored by Moscow as possible successors to Mr. Honecker Dresden party secretary Hans Modrow and Politburo member Guenter Schabowski were passed over .
If Mr. Krenz sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the Soviet Union could intensify .
In Moscow Mr. Gorbachev sent Mr. Krenz a congratulatory telegram that appeared to urge the new leadership to heed growing calls for change .
According to the Soviet news agency Tass Gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany being sensitive to the demands of the time will find solutions to complicated problems the GDR German Democratic Republic encountered .
A force of younger pro-Gorbachev members in the East German bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country .
The older generation has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they did n't .
From the perspective of East Germany 's old guard reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their country 's reason for being .
Unlike the other nations of the bloc East Germany is a creature of the Cold War .
Erasing the differences still dividing Europe and the vast international reordering that implies wo n't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary .
But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map .
Which is what the Old Guard fears .
I 'm sure they 'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR 's future as a separately identifiable state says Michael Simmons a British journalist whose book on East Germany entitled The Unloved Country was published this month .
Up to now that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader Walter Ulbricht to establish the country 's international legitimacy followed by Mr. Honecker 's campaign to build the East bloc 's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise .
Neither man achieved perfection .
Early in 1987 Mr. Honecker and his team stopped paying thin compliments to Mr. Gorbachev and joined with Romania in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems .
The less-self-confident Czechoslovaks and Bulgarians in contrast declared their intentions to reform while doing nothing concrete about it .
The East German media soon began presenting Mr. Gorbachev 's speeches only as sketchy summaries and giving space to his opponents .
By late 1988 they were banning Soviet publications .
The country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road .
Mr. Honecker spoke of generally valid objective laws of socialism and left no room for debate .
With this year 's dislocations in China and the Soviet Union and the drive to democracy in Poland and Hungary the East German leadership grew still more defensive .
Politburo member Joachim Herrman confessed to a grave concern over Hungarian democracy .
Under the banner that proclaims the renewal of socialism he said forces are at work that are striving to eliminate socialism .
Some loyal voices in and out of the East German Communist party saw the nation 's unrest coming .
The first signs were economic .
Despite heavily subsidized consumer industries East Germans have for years watched the West pull farther out ahead .
In 1988 for the first time economic growth came to a dead stop .
Gingerly some economists began to blame central planning .
Some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy at least in the workplace .
By summer an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before .
But they are stalwart socialists .
Their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse East Germany of its Stalinist muck not to merge with the West .
One of their pastors has envisioned a new utopia of creative socialism .
Meanwhile the man Mr. Krenz replaces has left an indelible mark on East German society .
Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs Mr. Honecker typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in Eastern Europe who took their cues from Moscow .
He was a socialist warrior who felt rankled by West Germany 's enormous postwar prosperity and the Bonn government 's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state .
Finally during his first and only state visit to Bonn two years ago he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought .
But ultimately he was undone by forces unleashed by his own comrade Mr. Gorbachev .
Mr. Honecker 's removal was bound to happen says one aide to Chancellor Kohl .
It was only a matter of time .
The European Community Commission increased its forecast for economic growth in the EC in 1989 to 3.5 % slightly higher than its June projection of 3.25 % .
In its annual economic report for 1989-1990 the commission also projected 1990 gross domestic product growth for the 12 EC members at 3 % .
EC inflation was seen at 4.8 % in 1989 higher than 1988 's 3.6 % price rise .
However inflation for 1990 was seen slowing to 4.5 % .
Leading EC growth forecasts in 1989 was Ireland seen growing 5 % at constant prices .
Slower growth countries included Greece at 2.5 % the U.K. at 2.25 % and Denmark at 1.75 % .
Inflation is expected to be highest in Greece where it is projected at 14.25 % and Portugal at 13 % .
At the other end of the spectrum West German inflation was forecast at 3 % in 1989 and 2.75 % in 1990 .
Nestle Korea Ltd. opened a coffee and non-dairy-creamer plant in Chongju South Korea .
An official at Nestle Korea a 50-50 joint venture between Nestle S.A. and the Doosan Group said the new facility will manufacture all types of soluble roasted and ground coffee coffee mix and nondairy coffee creamer .
The South Korean coffee market consisting mostly of instant coffee was estimated at about 100 billion won 150.7 million last year .
Brands made by the Kraft General Foods unit of Philip Morris Cos. had about 95 % of the market share .
Nestle currently has only about a 2 % share with its Taster 's Choice coffee .
Poland plans to start negotiations soon on purchasing natural gas from Iran the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported .
The agency said Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki told Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi of Poland 's willingess to purchase the gas during Mr. Vaezi 's current visit to Warsaw .
The agency did n't mention possible quantities and did n't say how the gas would be delivered .
A Chinese official harshly criticized plans to close a British naval base in downtown Hong Kong .
Hong Kong officials announced last week that the base will be relocated to a small island to allow downtown redevelopment .
But Beijing wants to use the base for the People 's Liberation Army after 1997 when the territory returns to Chinese sovereignty .
Ke Zaishuo head of China 's delegation to a Chinese-British Liaison Committee on Hong Kong accused Britain of trying to impose a fait accompli and said This is something we can not accept .
The Israeli and Soviet national airlines have reached preliminary agreement for launching the first direct flights between Tel Aviv and Moscow a spokesman for the Israeli airline El Al said .
El Al director Rafi Har-Lev and top officials of the Soviet Union 's Aeroflot negotiated a preliminary pact in Moscow this week the spokesman said .
He added that concluding the deal requires approval by the governments of both countries which have never had direct air links .
The chairman and a director of one of the Republic of Singapore 's leading property companies City Development Ltd. or CDL were charged yesterday with criminal breach of trust of some 800,000 Singapore dollars about 409,000 .
Kwek Hong Png chairman of CDL and director Quek Leng Chye were arrested by the republic 's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau Tuesday night .
In addition to abetting in the alleged criminal breach of trust Kwek Hong Png was also charged with dishonestly receiving 500,000 that had been stolen .
Both men were charged in a subordinate court and released on bail of 1 million .
The charges are the culmination of weeks of rumors concerning CDL that have depressed the company 's share price and to a lesser extent the shares of all companies owned by CDL 's controlling Quek family brokers in Singapore say .
The Queks control the Hong Leong Group which has widespread interests in manufacturing property and finance in both Malaysia and Singapore .
News of the arrest and charging of the two men helped to push prices on the Singapore Stock market sharply lower in early trading yesterday but brokers said that the market and CDL shares recovered once it became apparent the charges were limited to the two men personally .

As the citizens of San Francisco and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from Tuesday 's devastating earthquake NBC News began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake 's initial moments .
In terms of coverage it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes said Eric Premner president for broadcasting of King Broadcasting Co. which owns the NBC affiliate in Seattle Wash .
While rival ABC News outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck the network was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park when the quake struck NBC News was unable to get its signal out of San Francisco for the first hour after the quake .
I have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster said Mr. Premner .
So before I start to be really critical of NBC I would like to know more about what happened .
There were no complaints from affiliates of CBS Inc. and Cable News Network a unit of Turner Broadcasting System Inc .
But that was not the case at NBC News which has been dogged with the image of not being aggressive on major breaking stories .
Last summer the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student uprising in China .
I was not pleased with the slow start and neither was NBC News
