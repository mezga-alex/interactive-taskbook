tial claims .
He added B.A.T has no expectation of a material impact on Farmers .
Bridge and highway collapses will disrupt truck and auto transportation in the San Francisco Bay area for months to come .
But rail air and ocean-shipping links to the area escaped Tuesday 's earthquake with only minor damage and many are expected to be operating normally today government and corporate transport officials said .
Air traffic at San Francisco International Airport was running about 50 % of normal yesterday afternoon but airport officals said they expect a return to full operations by Saturday .
The major gateway to Asia and one of the nation 's 10 busiest airports was closed to all but emergency traffic from the time the quake hit Tuesday afternoon until 6 a.m. PDT yesterday when controllers returned to the tower .
Getting to and from the airport in coming weeks may be the problem however .
People 's ability to drive throughout the bay area is greatly restricted said a spokesman for the American Automobile Association .
Tom Schumacher executive vice president and general manager of the California Trucking Association in Sacremento said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the Bay area yesterday except for emergency-medical supplies .
Some foodstuff shipments will probably resume Thursday he said .
Right now most of the roads into the Bay area are closed but the list of closings changes about every 20 minutes .
This Wednesday morning the San Mateo bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed Mr. Schumacher said .
United Parcel Service Greenwich Conn. said its operations in the San Francisco area have been reduced to 40 % of normal .
A UPS spokesman said that although none of the company 's terminals trucks or airplanes were damaged in the quake road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages .
The spokesman noted four-hour to five-hour traffic delays on the San Mateo bridge for example .
In addition power failures prevented its package-sorting facilities from operating causing delays .
But freight railroads reported that damage to their facilities was relatively minor with Santa Fe Pacific Corp. 's rail unit the least affected by the quake .
Santa Fe stopped freight trains Tuesday night while its officials inspected track but resumed service at 10:45 p.m. when they found no damage .
Union Pacific Corp. 's rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its Oakland yard its track bridges and structures were unharmed .
That railroad is operating trains but with delays caused by employees unable to get to work .
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. the hardest hit of the three railroads in the Bay area said service on its north-south coastline which is used by an Amtrak train between Los Angeles and Seattle was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake .
But service on the line is expected to resume by noon today .
We had no serious damage on the railroad said a Southern Pacific spokesman .
We have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down .
Amtrak said it suspended train service into its Oakland station which sustained heavy structural damage during the quake .
The passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in Sacramento relying on buses to ferry passengers to the Bay area .
Amtrak said it planned to resume some train operations to Oakland late yesterday .
Rail-transit operations suffered little damage according to Albert Engelken deputy executive director of the American Public Transit Association in Washington .
The Bay Area Rapid Transit withstood the earthquake perfectly said Mr. Engelken adding that the rail system was running a full fleet of 45 trains during the day to provide an alternative for highway travelers .
The highway system is screwed up by the earthquake Mr. Engelken said .
The transit system is how people are going to be getting around .
He added that San Francisco 's trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels .
Although air-traffic delays in San Francisco were significant yesterday they did n't appear to spread to other airports .
The earthquake shattered windows at San Francisco International 's air-traffic control tower and rained pieces of the ceiling down on controllers three of whom suffered minor injuries .
Terminals at San Francisco International also were damaged but the tower itself was intact .
Tuesday night thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel .
Runways at San Francisco were n't damaged but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour down from 33 to 45 an hour normally mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows an FAA spokeswoman said .
While the airport was closed flights were diverted to airports in Sacramento and Stockton Calif. Reno and Las Vegas Nev. and Los Angeles .
United Airlines the largest carrier at San Francisco was operating only 50 % of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area .
A United spokesman said 14 of its 21 gates were unusable mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors .
The United spokesman said none of its people were injured at the airport in fact as the airport was being evacuated Tuesday night two babies were born .
Yesterday the United ticket counter was active with people trying to get flights out but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active with people trying to get there to help family and friends .
The airports in San Jose and Oakland were both fully operational by noon yesterday the Federal Aviation Administration said .
In terms of diversions Denver 's Stapleton International may have experienced the most far-flung A United flight from Japan was rerouted there .
I think that 's the first nonstop commercial passenger flight from Japan to land here an airport spokesman said .
A Japan Air Lines spokesman said its flights into and out of San Francisco were n't affected but getting information about its operations was difficult .
Its telecommunications headquarters in Burlingame Calif. had been knocked out since the quake .
We 're in the dark he said .
Whitbread & Co. put its spirits division up for sale triggering a scramble among global groups for the British company 's brands .
Whitbread already has been approached by about half a dozen companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business a spokesman said .
Analysts expect the spirits operations and some California vineyards that also are being sold to fetch about 500 million 788.8 million .
Among the brands for sale are Beefeater gin the No. 2 imported gin in the U.S. and Laphroaig single-malt whiskey .
Also for sale are Buckingham Wile Co. which distributes Cutty Sark blended whiskey in the U.S. and Whitbread 's Atlas Peak Vineyards in California 's Napa Valley .
Beefeater alone is worth as much as 300 million analysts said .
Whitbread bought the Beefeater distillery two years ago for 174.5 million .
That purchase represented an attempt by Whitbread a venerable British brewer to become a major player in the global liquor business .
But Whitbread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry .
Now it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations .
For rival liquor companies the Whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands .
It 's not very often something like this comes up said Ron Littleboy a liquor company analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London .
The division will be sold off quite rapidly predicted Neill Junor an analyst at London brokers County NatWest WoodMac .
Among possible buyers Grand Metropolitan PLC might find Beefeater a useful addition to its portfolio .
Grand Met owns Bombay gin the No. 3 imported gin in the U.S. rival Guinness PLC has the No. 1 imported brand Tanqueray .
The Whitbread spirits auction is an extremely interesting development and naturally we 'll be considering it carefully a Grand Met spokesman said .
Guinness which owns several leading whiskey brands plus Gordon 's gin the world 's No. 1 gin is considered less likely to bid for the Whitbread spirits .
A Guinness spokesman declined to comment .
Two other global liquor giants Canada 's Seagram Co. and Britain 's Allied-Lyons PLC also are possible buyers .
Seagram 's gin is the world 's No. 2 gin brand but the company does n't own any of the major gin brands imported in the U.S. .
Allied-Lyons while powerful in whiskey does n't own any major white-spirit brands .
We will certainly have to take a look at the Whitbread spirits business an Allied-Lyons spokesman said .
We would certainly like to have a major white-spirits brand in our portfolio .
A Seagram spokesman in New York would n't comment .
Smaller liquor companies such as Brown-Forman Corp. and American Brands Inc. of the U.S. also are likely to be interested .
Such companies are increasingly being left behind in the global liquor business says Nomura 's Mr. Littleboy .
In New York a spokesman for American Brands would n't comment .
Brown-Forman a Louisville Ky. distiller also declined to comment .
Whitbread 's wine spirits and soft-drink operations had trading profit of 35.4 million on sales of 315.5 million in the year ended Feb. 25 .
The company which is retaining most of its wine and all of its soft-drink interests did n't break out results for the businesses it plans to sell .
But analysts estimate their trading profit at 30 million .
Whitbread had total pretax profit in the year ended Feb. 25 of 223.2 million on sales of 2.26 billion .
Whitbread 's spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the British beer industry .
Earlier this year the government announced plans to foster increased competition in the industry .
British brewers currently own thousands of pubs which in turn sell only the breweries ' beer and soft drinks .
Under new rules many of the country 's pubs would become free houses selling beers of their choice .
Whitbread now intends to bolster its brewing interests in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses .
The company which last month paid 50.7 million for regional British brewer Boddington Group PLC has about 13 % of the British beer market .
Whitbread also owns the license to brew and distribute Heineken and Stella Artois beers in Britain .
In addition Whitbread intends to focus on its newer hotel liquor store and restaurant businesses in Europe and North America .
In Britain those interests include the Beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with PepsiCo Inc. of the country 's Pizza Hut chain .
In Canada and the U.S. Whitbread owns The Keg chain of steak and seafood restaurants .
Focusing on beer restaurants and hotels means we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively Peter Jarvis Whitbread 's managing director said in a statement .
The spirits business would require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players .
Whitbread also announced that Mr. Jarvis who is 48 will become the company 's chief executive March 1 .
At that time Sam Whitbread the company 's chairman and a descendant of its 18th-century founder will retire from executive duties .
He will retain the honorary title of non-executive chairman .
The Treasury plans to raise 700 million in new cash with the sale Tuesday of about 10 billion in two-year notes to redeem 9.29 billion in maturing notes .
The offering will be dated Oct. 31 and mature Oct. 31 Tenders for the notes available in minimum 5,000 denominations must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Tuesday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
NEWHALL LAND & FARMING Co. Valencia Calif. announced a 2-for-1 split in the real estate limited partnership 's units and increased its regular quarterly cash distribution 33 % to 40 cents a unit .
The real estate limited partnership also said it will pay a special year-end cash distribution of 10 cents a unit .
Both distributions are payable Dec. 4 to limited partners of record Nov. 3 .
Mellon Bank Corp. said directors authorized the buy-back of as many as 250,000 common shares .
The bank holding company said stock repurchased will be used to meet requirements for the company 's benefit plans .
Mellon has 36.6 million shares outstanding .
Champion International Corp. 's third-quarter profit dropped 17 % reflecting price declines for certain paper products operating problems at certain mills and other factors .
The paper producer reported that net income fell to 102.1 million or 1.09 a share from 122.4 million or 1.29 a share in the year-earlier period .
Sales rose 2.6 % to 1.32 billion from 1.29 billion .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Champion 's shares rose 25 cents to 32.125 .
Digital Equipment Corp. is planning a big coming-out party on Tuesday for its first line of mainframe computers .
But an uninvited guest is expected to try to crash the party .
On the morning of the long-planned announcement International Business Machines Corp. is to introduce its own new mainframe .
Their attitude is You want to talk mainframes we 'll talk mainframes says one computer industry executive .
They 're deliberately trying to steal our thunder a Digital executive complains .
Maybe we should take it as a compliment .
Digital 's target is the 40 billion market for mainframe computers the closet-sized number-crunchers that nearly every big company needs to run its business .
IBM based in Armonk N.Y. has dominated the market for decades .
That does n't scare Digital which has grown to be the world 's second-largest computer maker by poaching customers of IBM 's mid-range machines .
Digital based in Maynard Mass. hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes and it has spent almost 1 billion developing the new technology .
A spoiler nimble Tandem Computers Inc. in Cupertino Calif. jumped into the fray earlier this week with an aggressively priced entry .
IBM appears more worried about Digital which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line dubbed the VAX 9000 .
It 's going to be nuclear war says Thomas Willmott a consultant with Aberdeen Group Inc .
The surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market where growth has slowed to single digits in recent years .
IBM 's traditional mainframe rivals including Unisys Corp. Control Data Corp. and NCR Corp. have struggled recently .
Digital is promising a new approach .
Robert M. Glorioso Digital 's vice president for high performance systems says Digital 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations personal computers printers and other devices .
And unlike IBM 's water-cooled mainframes it does n't need any plumbing .
The challengers will have a big price advantage .
Digital is expected to tag its new line from about 1.24 million to 4.4 million and up depending on configuration .
That 's about half the price of comparably equipped IBM mainframes .
Tandem 's pricing is just as aggressive .
The heightened competition will hit IBM at a difficult time .
The computer giant 's current mainframe line which has sold well and has huge profit margins is starting to show its age .
The new 3090s due next week will boost performance by only about 8 % to 10 % .
And IBM is n't expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until 1991 .
Still no one expects IBM 's rivals to deliver a knockout .
IBM has a near-monopoly on mainframes with an estimated 70 % share of the market .
IBM is five times the size of Digital and 40 times the size of Tandem and wields enormous market power .
It counts among its customers a majority of the world 's largest corporations which entrust their most critical business information to IBM computers .
We 're not going to walk in and replace a company 's corporate accounting system if it 's already running on an IBM mainframe concedes Kenneth H. Olsen Digital 's president .
He says Digital will target faster-growing market segments such as on-line transaction processing which includes retail-sales tracking airline reservations and bank-teller networks .
Tandem which already specializes in on-line transaction processing is a potent competitor in that market .
A key marketing target for Digital will be the large number of big customers who already own both Digital and IBM systems .
One such company is Bankers Trust Co .
Stanley Rose a vice president technological and strategic planning at Bankers Trust says that despite Digital 's low prices we are n't about to unplug our IBM mainframes for a DEC machine .
The software conversion costs would dwarf any savings .
But Mr. Rose is still looking seriously at the 9000 .
Bankers Trust uses Digital 's VAX to run its huge money-transfer and capital markets accounts juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day he says .
As that system grows larger computers may be needed .
In the past customers had to go to IBM when they outgrew the VAX .
Now they do n't have to he says .
That 's going to cost IBM revenue .
Analysts say Digital can expect this pent-up demand for the new VAX to fuel strong sales next year .
Barry F. Willman an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. estimates the 9000 could boost sales by more than 1 billion in the fiscal year beginning in July .
He bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds of Digital 's largest customers .
Although Digital will announce a full family of mainframes next week it is n't expected to begin shipping in volume until next year .
The first model available will be the 210 which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the optional super-charger or vector processor says Terry Shannon of International Data Corp. a market research concern .
Four more models aimed squarely at IBM 's commercial customers are expected to begin shipping in late June .
Most analysts do n't expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal first quarter which begins next July 1 .
Digital 's new line has been a long time coming .
The company has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe-class product and made a costly decision in 1988 to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end .
Digital 's failure to deliver a true mainframe-class machine before now may have cost the company as much as 1 billion in revenue in fiscal 1989 Mr. Willman says .
IBM will face still more competition in coming months .
Amdahl Corp. backed by Japan 's Fujitsu Ltd. has a growing share of the market with its low-priced IBM-compatible machines .
And National Advanced Systems a joint venture of Japan 's Hitachi Ltd. and General Motors Corp. 's Electronic Data Systems is expected to unveil a line of powerful IBM-compatible mainframes later this year .

The frenetic stock and bond markets cooled off but the dollar slumped .
Stocks rose slightly as trading activity slowed from the frenzied pace earlier this week .
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds hovered in a narrow band most of the day finishing little changed despite the dollar 's weakness and fears about a wave of government borrowing coming soon .
Helped by futures-related program buying the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4.92 points to close at 2643.65 .
But the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell for the seventh-consecutive session as more investors dumped UAL shares .
Bond prices rallied early yesterday morning as traders scrambled to buy Treasury issues on fears that the Northern California earthquake might lead to a stock-market debacle .
But when stocks held steady Treasury bonds later retreated .
Speculation that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in coming weeks helped push the dollar down while boosting stocks traders said .
But many investors remain wary about stocks partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk-bond market that would make it more difficult to finance corporate takeovers .
I 'm surprised we did n't see more volatility in stocks said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker .
I think the problems in the junk-bond area are just beginning and this will be very unsettling for companies that have issued junk bonds .
In a bull market credit does not matter Mr. DeVoe added .
But when it does matter then it 's the only thing that matters .
However many institutional investors are reacting to the stock market 's plunge as a great buying opportunity said Charles I. Clough chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
Things are beginning to settle down .
The markets are returning to normalcy .
Oil prices initially rose on fears that the massive earthquake in Northern California would disrupt production .
But prices later reversed course finishing slightly lower as investors concluded that any cuts would n't be large and that foreign oil producers would quickly pick up the slack .
In major market activity Stock prices rose .
New York Stock Exchange volume shrank to 166.9 million shares from 224.1 million Tuesday .
Advancers on the Big Board outpaced decliners by 822 to 668 .
Bond prices were little changed in sluggish activity .
The yield on the Treasury 's 30-year issue fell slightly to 8.03 % .
The dollar dropped .
In New York late yesterday the currency was at 141.45 yen and 1.8485 marks down from 142.75 yen and 1.8667 marks late Tuesday .
James L. Madson 46 years old was named a vice president and assistant general manager of this producer of copper and other minerals .

AMR Corp. posted an 8.8 % drop in third-quarter net income and said the fourth quarter will be disappointing as well primarily because of slimmer profit margins and increased fuel costs .
AMR 's earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of American Airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records .
Some analysts say the latest results only seem pale by comparison with a spectacular second half of 1988 .
Still AMR 's stumble does n't bode well for the rest of the industry .
The Fort Worth Texas company is generally regarded as one of the best-run in the business and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days .
Meanwhile the company 's board which had said nothing publicly about investor Donald Trump 's recently withdrawn 7.5 billion offer for AMR issued a statement condemning ill-conceived and reckless bids and saying it was pleased that Mr. Trump had backed out .
In the third quarter AMR said net fell to 137 million or 2.16 a share from 150.3 million or 2.50 a share .
Revenue rose 17 % to 2.73 billion from 2.33 billion a year earlier .
AMR 's chairman Robert L. Crandall said the results were due to an 11 % year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield an industry measure analogous to profit margin on each seat sold .
We think these trends will continue and will produce a very disappointing fourth quarter as well he said .
Tim Pettee an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. said The business turned faster than expected .
Costs are giving them a little bit of trouble and the whole industry is having a pricing problem .
For the nine months AMR 's net rose 15 % to 415.9 million or 6.59 a share from 360.1 million or 5.99 a share .
Revenue jumped 22 % to 7.89 billion from 6.46 billion .
AMR 's board in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday said Ill-considered and reckless acquisition proposals adversely affect employee financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of AMR shareholders .
AMR has not been and is not for sale .
Mr. Crandall said the company 's current decline in earnings is exactly the kind of situation that an excessively leveraged company laden with debt from a takeover would find difficult to weather .
Our very disappointing third-quarter results and the discouraging outlook for the fourth quarter underscore the importance of an adequate capital base he said .
Christopher Whittington 51-year-old deputy chairman of this British investment-banking group and chairman of Morgan Grenfell & Co. the group 's main banking unit has retired from his executive duties .

Succeeding Mr. Whittington at Morgan Grenfell & Co. is Richard Webb 50 currently deputy chairman .
Mr. Whittington will remain on the main group board as a nonexecutive director .
Without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses the economic and structural damage by Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina would have been much less as highlighted by your Oct. 3 editorial Subsidizing Disaster .
Congress should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands such as the hard-hit Isle of Palms near Charleston .
As you mentioned subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the Coastal Barrier Resource System .
The National Taxpayers Union would like Congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989 .
This bill simply says that if you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do so without taxpayer support .
Private-property rights would be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development .
However home builders would have to bear the full costs of such beach-house construction .
A Taxpayers Union study concluded the bill would save taxpayers up to 9.3 billion in barrier-island subsidies over 20 years .
Already the 1982 legislation has saved an estimated 800 million .
Marshall Y. Taylor Communications Director National Taxpayers Union The government said 13.1 % of Americans or 31.9 million people were living in poverty in 1988 .
While last year 's figure was down from 13.4 % in 1987 and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate the Census Bureau said the 1988 drop was n't statistically significant .
The bureau 's report also showed that while some measures of the nation 's economic well-being improved modestly in 1988 the fruits of prosperity were shared less equitably than the year before .
Summarizing data derived from a March 1989 survey of 58,000 households William Butz associate director of the Census Bureau said that most groups either stayed the same or improved .
But he added Since the late 1960s the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal .
There was no reversal of that trend between 1987 and 1988 .
Per capita income a widely used measure of a nation 's economic health hit a record in 1988 rising 1.7 % after inflation adjustment to 13,120 .
But the median income of American families fell 0.2 % the first time it has failed to rise since 1982 .
Mr. Butz said the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure including the rising number of female-headed families and a sharp increase in income reported by Americans who are n't living in families .
As a result of last year 's decline the government 's estimate for the number of people living below the poverty line declined by about 500,000 .
The poverty threshold defined as three times food expenses as calculated by the Agricultural Department last year was 12,092 for a family of four .
The Census Bureau counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line but it does n't consider other government benefits such as Medicare .
Thanks largely to the continued growth of the U.S. economy the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the 1983 peak of 15.3 % but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years .
Poverty remains far more widespread among blacks than other Americans .
In 1988 31.6 % of blacks lived in poverty compared with 10.1 % for whites and 26.8 % for Hispanics .
But two-thirds of all poor Americans were white .
More than half of poor families were headed by women living without men the bureau said .
More than three-fourths of poor black families were headed by women .
The poverty rate of children under 18 years old dropped last year to 19.7 % from 20.5 % in 1987 but remained far higher than a decade ago .
The rate among the elderly 12 % in 1988 was n't significantly lower than the year before .
If it were n't for Social Security payments more than three times as many elderly would be below the poverty line Mr. Butz said .
The Census Bureau also said Some 17.2 % of all money income received by families in 1988 went to the wealthiest 5 % of all families up from 16.9 % in 1987 .
That is the greatest share reported for any year since 1950 although changing definitions over the years distort the comparison .
The top fifth of all families got 44 % of the income up from 41.5 % a decade earlier .
The bottom fifth of all families got 4.6 % of the income down from 5.2 % a decade earlier .
Confirming other government data showing that wages are n't keeping pace with inflation earnings of year-round full-time male workers fell 1.3 % in 1988 after adjusting for higher prices the first such drop since 1982 .
Earnings of female workers were unchanged .
Women working full-time earned 66 cents for every dollar earned by men a penny more than in 1987 and seven cents more than in 1978 .
Median household income which includes both those living in families and those who are n't rose 0.3 % last year to 27,225 after inflation .
It rose sharply in the Northeast and Midwest and fell slightly in the South and West .
Median family income was 32,191 down 0.2 % .
Per capita income of blacks though still only 60 % that of whites rose 3.9 % in 1988 while per capita income of whites rose only 1.5 % .
Among married couples the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply as income of black families shot up 6.8 % while income of whites did n't budge .
Fueling a controversy that has been simmering for years the Census Bureau also said its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer-price measure adopted in 1983 .
The bureau said some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988 and the poverty rate would have been 10.5 % instead of 13.1 % under the alternative calculation .
Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years .
A report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress released yesterday concluded It is misleading to make this change without adjusting for other changes .
The official poverty threshold is set by the Office of Management and Budget .
John E. Hayes Jr. was elected chairman president and chief executive officer succeeding David S. Black who retired .
Mr. Hayes 52 years old left Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. in January where he had been chairman president and chief executive to join Triad Capital Partners a St. Louis company with interests in solid waste and recycling telecommunications and international venture capital .
He has resigned his posts at Triad to take the Kansas Power positions .
Kansas Power said Mr. Black 61 chose early retirement .
The space shuttle Atlantis boosted the Galileo spacecraft on its way to Jupiter giving a big lift as well to an ambitious U.S. program of space exploration .
Seven years late in the launching 1 billion over budget and a target of anti-nuclear protestors Galileo has long been a symbol of trouble for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration .
But yesterday as Atlantis rumbled into a patch of clear sky above Florida with storm clouds closing in on it NASA sought to turn Galileo into a symbol of triumph .
NASA did it right that 's the message said J.R. Thompson the agency 's deputy administrator .
The 1.4 billion robot spacecraft faces a six-year journey to explore Jupiter and its 16 known moons .
If all goes well it will parachute a probe into the dense Jovian atmosphere in July 1995 to pick up detailed data about gases that may be similar to the material from which the solar system was formed 4.6 billion years ago .
Jupiter is so enormous its mass is 318 times that of Earth that its gravity may have trapped these primordial gases and never let them escape .
Investigating Jupiter in detail may provide clues to what astronomer Tobias Owen calls the cosmic paradox of life Jupiter and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on Earth but these planets are lifeless Earth on the other hand has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life .
Some scientists have suggested that comets and asteroids may have brought enough of this kind of material from the outer solar system to Earth to spawn life .
Beginning in December 1995 Galileo will begin a two-year tour of the Jovian moons .
In 1979 two Voyager spacecraft sent back stunning photos of Jovian moons Io and Europa that showed them to be among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system .
The photos showed active geysers on Io spewing sulfurous material 190 miles into its atmosphere and indicated that Europa may have an ocean hidden under a thick sheet of ice .
Galileo 's photos of Europa will be more than 1,000 times as sharp as Voyager 's according to Torrence Johnson Galileo 's project scientist and may show whether it actually has the only known ocean other than those on Earth .
Atlantis lifted Galileo from the launch pad at 12:54 p.m. EDT and released the craft from its cargo bay about six hours later .
Galileo is on its way to another world in the hands of the best flight controllers in this world Atlantis Commander Donald Williams said .
Fly safely .
The five-member Atlantis crew will conduct several experiments including growing plants and processing polymeric materials in space before their scheduled landing at Edwards Air Force Base Calif. Monday .
The Galileo project started in 1977 and a number of project veterans were on hand to watch the launch .
An ebullient Mr. Johnson wearing a NASA baseball cap and carrying a camera and binoculars called the launch fantastic .
Benny Chin manager of the Galileo probe compared it to watching a child leave home .
I 'm happy and sad he said .
Anti-nuclear activists took a less positive view .
Having argued that Galileo 's plutonium power source could have released lethal doses of radiation if the shuttle exploded yesterday they were n't quieted by yesterday 's successful launch .
Galileo will skim past Earth in 1990 and 1992 collecting energy from the planet 's gravitational field to gain momentum for its trip to Jupiter .
The protesters point out that Galileo also could crash to Earth then .
They said they dropped plans to infiltrate the Kennedy Space Center after NASA beefed up its security .
One protest did get past NASA 's guard though a computer virus caused anti-Galileo messages to flash onto some computer screens at NASA centers .

The Associated Press 's earthquake coverage drew attention to a phenomenon that deserves some thought by public officials and other policy makers .
Private relief agencies such as the Salvation Army and Red Cross mobilized almost instantly to help people while the Washington bureaucracy took hours getting into gear .
One news show we saw yesterday even displayed 25 federal officials meeting around a table .
We recall that the mayor of Charleston complained bitterly about the federal bureaucracy 's response to Hurricane Hugo .
The sense grows that modern public bureaucracies simply do n't perform their assigned functions well .
Bally Manufacturing Corp. and New York developer Donald Trump have agreed in principle to a 6.5 million settlement of shareholder litigation stemming from Bally 's alleged greenmail payment to Mr. Trump .
According to lawyers familiar with the settlement talks the verbal agreement to end a lawsuit filed more than two years ago was reached last week and will soon be submitted to a federal judge in Camden N.J .
In February 1987 Bally thwarted a possible hostile takeover bid from Mr. Trump by agreeing to buy 2.6 million of Mr. Trump 's 3.1 million Bally shares for 83.7 million more than 18 million above market price .
The term greenmail refers to a situation where a company pays a premium over market value to repurchase a stake held by a potential acquirer .
Lawyers for shareholders Bally and Mr. Trump all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement citing a request by a federal court magistrate not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed .
But some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said the 6.5 million payment will be shared by Bally and Mr. Trump with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money .
The amount Bally and Mr. Trump will pay to settle the class-action suit pales in comparison to the 45 million Walt Disney Co. and Saul Steinberg 's Reliance Group Holdings Inc. agreed to pay to settle a similar suit in July .
That settlement represented the first time shareholders were granted a major payment in a greenmail case .
Mr. Steinberg made a 59.7 million profit on the sale to Disney of his investment in the company in 1984 .
But lawyers said Mr. Steinberg probably faced much more potential liability because when he sued Disney during his takeover battle he filed on behalf of all shareholders .
When Disney offered to pay Mr. Steinberg a premium for his shares the New York investor did n't demand the company also pay a premium to other shareholders .
When Mr. Trump sued Bally he sued only on behalf of himself .
Mr. Trump and Bally also appeared to have some leverage in the case because in the state of Delaware where Bally is incorporated courts have held that greenmail is often protected by the business-judgment rule .
That rule gives boards of directors wide latitude in deciding how to deal with dissident shareholders .
SENATE HEARS final arguments in impeachment trial of federal judge .
Yesterday U.S. Judge Alcee Hastings faced his jury the full U.S. Senate and said I am not guilty of having committed any crime .
Seventeen articles of impeachment against the Florida judge one of the few blacks on the U.S. bench were approved by the House in August 1988 .
The central charge against Judge Hastings is that he conspired with a Washington lawyer to obtain a 150,000 bribe from defendants in a criminal case before the judge in return for leniency .
He is also accused of lying under oath and of leaking information obtained from a wiretap he supervised .
The Senate 's public gallery was packed with Judge Hastings ' supporters who erupted into applause after he finished his argument .
Judge Hastings who was acquitted of similar charges by a federal jury in 1983 claims he is being victimized and that the impeachment proceedings against him constitute double jeopardy .
But Rep. John Bryant D. Texas the lead counsel for the House managers who conducted a lengthy inquiry into Judge Hastings ' activities said a mountain of evidence points to his certain guilt .
The Senate will deliberate behind closed doors today and is scheduled to vote on the impeachment tomorrow .
If the judge is impeached as is thought likely he will be removed from office immediately .
However Judge Hastings has said he will continue to fight and is contemplating an appeal of any impeachment to the U.S. Supreme Court .
COMPANIES SEEKING to make insurers pay for pollution cleanup win court victory .
In a case involving Avondale Industries Inc. and its insurer Travelers Cos. the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say are central to dozens of pollution cases around the country .
Travelers and other insurers have maintained that cleanup costs are n't damages and thus are n't covered under commercial policies .
They also have argued that government proceedings notifying a company of potential responsibility do n't fit the legal definition of a lawsuit thus such governmental proceedings are n't covered by the policies the insurers say .
The appeals court disagreed on both counts .
Avondale was notified by Louisiana officials in 1986 that it was potentially responsible for a cleanup at an oil-recycling plant .
Avondale asked Travelers to defend it in the state proceeding but the insurer did n't respond .
The appeals court upheld a district judge 's ruling that the insurer had to defend the company in such proceedings .
The appeals court also said We think an ordinary businessman reading this policy would have believed himself covered for the demands and potential damage claims stemming from any cleanup .
This decision will have a very considerable impact said Kenneth Abraham professor of environmental law and insurance law at the University of Virginia because many commercial insurance policies are issued by companies based in New York .
William Greaney an attorney for the Chemical Manufacturers Association said that while other appeals courts have ruled differently on whether cleanup costs are damages the influence of the appeals court in New York will make insurers sit up and listen .
He said the decision was the first in which a federal appeals court has ruled whether administrative government proceedings qualify as litigation .
Barry R. Ostrager an attorney for Travelers said there are procedural bases on which this case will be appealed further .
NEW YORK 'S poor face nearly three million legal problems a year without legal help .
That is the conclusion of a report released by the New York State Bar Association .
The report was based on a telephone survey of 1,250 low-income households across the state a mail survey of major legal-services programs and on-site interviews with individuals in the field .
The report provides detailed documentation of the extent and nature of the problem and indicates how we may want to shape solutions said Joseph Genova chairman of the committee that oversaw the survey and a partner at the law firm of Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy .
According to the study slightly more than 34 % of those surveyed reported having at least one housing problem every year for which they had no legal help .
Nearly 36 % ranked housing problems as their most serious unmet legal need .
Other areas targeted by the survey 's respondents included difficulty obtaining or maintaining public benefits 22 % consumer fraud 15.4 % and health-care issues 15 % .
During the 15-month survey 43 % of all legal-services programs said that at some period they were unable to accept new clients unless they had an emergency .
Mr. Genova said the committee may meet to propose solutions to the problems identified in the study .

After failing to find a buyer for the Sears Tower in Chicago Sears Roebuck & Co. is negotiating with Boston pension fund adviser Aldrich Eastman & Waltch Inc. to refinance the property for close to 850 million according to people close to the negotiations .
Under the proposed agreement involving the world 's tallest building Chicago-based Sears would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage .
At the end of the term of the convertible loan Sears could still own half the building and AEW could own the other half .
Neither side would comment .
The parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building which will be emptied of 6,000 employees from Sears ' merchandise group which is moving elsewhere .
The new manager will face the daunting task of leasing 1.8 million square feet in a relatively soft Chicago real estate market .
Also it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage AEW will be able to convert into equity .
Convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late .
In a convertible mortgage the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity usually less than 50 % at the end of the loan term .
During the term the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return .
The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal .
Sears said it would put the 110-story tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its anti-takeover restructuring .
But Japanese institutions shied away from bidding on the high-profile tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger anti-Japanese sentiment .
Last summer Sears appeared to have a deal with Canadian developer Olympia & York Developments Ltd .
But that deal fell through in September after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax reassessment raising property taxes and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices .
Real estate industry executives said Sears ' investment banker Goldman Sachs & Co. sought financing in Japan .
However Japanese authorities apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too much publicity .
Sears then went back to AEW the Boston pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring .
AEW has 3.5 billion of real estate investments nationwide according to a spokesman .
Tandy Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire two units of Datatronic AB of Stockholm for cash .
The amount was n't disclosed .
The electronics maker and retailer previously estimated the sale price at between 100 million and 200 million for Datatronic 's Victor microcomputer and Micronic hand-held computer subsidiaries .
In addition Tandy will acquire rights to the Victor and Micronic names for computers .
During 1988 the Datatronic subsidiaries had combined sales in excess of 200 million .
The transaction will give Tandy a well-known European computer brand that includes 2,700 dealers and distributors marketing to medium-sized business and educational institutions .
Closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals the company said .
Two rules in pending congressional legislation threaten to hinder leveraged buy-outs by raising the price tags of such deals by as much as 10 % .
Wall Street is seething over the rules which would curtail the tax deductibility of debt used in most LBOs .
The provisions in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s some tax experts and investment bankers argue .
Indeed some investment bankers have already started restructuring deals to cope with the expected rules .
Wall Street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous Senate version of one of the provisions .
At issue is the deductibility of certain junk bonds that are used in most LBOs .
Such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value with interest accruing instead of being paid to the holder .
Under current rules that accrued interest is deductible by the company issuing the debt .
The House version of the legislation would kill that deduction and label any such debt as equity which is n't deductible .
The less-rigorous Senate version would defer the deductibility for roughly five years .
You see these in just about every LBO said Robert Willens senior vice president in charge of tax issues at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York .
It becomes a source of cash for the company making the LBO because it gets a deduction and does n't have to repay the debt for several years .
Typically Mr. Willens estimates this type of debt makes up 15 % to 20 % of the financing for LBOs .
These types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as RJR Nabisco Inc. Storer Communications Inc. and Kroger Co .
A second provision passed by the Senate and House would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from LBO debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years .
For example if a company posted a loss of 100 million from buy-out interest payments the existing rule would allow the concern to be able to receive a refund from the tax it paid from 1986 through 1989 when it may have been a profitable public company .
But that rule is being virtually overlooked by Wall Street which is concentrating on coping with the deduction issue .
Prices for LBOs have to come down if you do n't have that feature argued Lawrence Schloss managing director for merchant banking at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York .
Several Wall Street officials say the proposed legislation already is having an impact .
An investment group led by Chicago 's Pritzker family recently lowered a 3.35 billion bid for American Medical International Beverly Hills Calif. because of the threat of the legislation .
Moreover one investment banker who requested anonymity said his firm did n't raise the ante for a target company earlier this month after a stronger bid emerged from a public company that was n't concerned about the financing provision .
We would have paid more if we thought that law was n't going to pass he said .
One possible solution for Wall Street is to increase the equity part of the transaction that is give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments .
That would force the buy-out firm and the target company 's management to reduce their level of ownership .
The pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through said Peter C. Canellos tax partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz .
Another solution said a tax lawyer who requested anonymity is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount .
Since they have a lower interest rate they would n't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility .
The House version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes has at least a five-year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five .
The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible .
The Senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid .
Currently even though the issuer does n't pay tax the debt holder is taxed on the accrued interest .
But those holders are often foreign investors and tax-exempt pension funds that do n't pay taxes on their holdings .
The Senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield 17 million the first year and a total of 409 million over five years .
The House version would raise slightly more .
Even if Wall Street finds ways around the new rules a Senate aide contends LBOs will become somewhat more difficult .
There 's no question it will make LBOs more expensive he said .
The interest deduction was the engine that made these things more productive .
The average publicly offered commodity fund fell 4.2 % in September largely because of the volatile markets in foreign currencies according to Norwood Securities .
The firm said that losers outnumbered gainers by more than three to one among the 122 funds it tracks .
For the first nine months of the year Norwood said the average fund has lost 3.3 % .
The government moved aggressively to open the spigots of federal aid for victims of the California earthquake but its reservoir of emergency funds must be replenished soon if the aid is to continue .
President Bush signed a disaster declaration covering seven Northern California counties .
The declaration immediately made the counties eligible for temporary housing grants and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses .
In addition an unusually wide array of federal agencies moved to provide specialized assistance .
The Department of Housing and Urban Development prepared to make as many as 100 vacant houses available for those left homeless the Agriculture Department was set to divert food from the school-lunch program to earthquake victims and the Pentagon was providing everything from radio communications to blood transfusions to military police for directing traffic .
But the pool of federal emergency-relief funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of cleaning up Hurricane Hugo and Congress will be under pressure to allocate more money quickly .
In Hugo 's wake Congress allocated 1.1 billion in relief funds and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said 273 million of that money remains and could be diverted for quick expenditures related to the earthquake .
Now though enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief .
That obviously means that we wo n't have enough for all of the emergencies that are now facing us and we will have to consider appropriate requests for follow-on funding Mr. Fitzwater said .
The federal government is n't even attempting yet to estimate how much the earthquake will cost it .
But Mr. Fitzwater said There will be I think quite obviously a very large amount of money required from all levels of government .
In Congress lawmakers already are looking for ways to add relief funds .
Money could be added to a pending spending bill covering the Federal Emergency Management Agency which coordinates federal disaster relief .
More likely relief funds could be added to an omnibus spending bill that Congress is to begin considering next week .
But it is n't just Washington 's relief dollars that are spread thin its relief manpower also is stretched .
FEMA still has special disaster centers open to handle the aftermath of Hugo and spokesman Russell Clanahan acknowledged that we 're pretty thin .
Mr. Clanahan says FEMA now possibly may have the heaviest caseload in its history .
To further complicate relief efforts the privately funded American Red Cross also finds itself strapped for funds after its big Hugo operation .
It 's been a bad month money-wise and every other way said Sally Stewart a spokeswoman for the Red Cross .
It just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget .
The Red Cross has opened 30 shelters in the Bay area serving 5,000 people .
Twenty-five trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other states .
All the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to California wo n't be determined until state officials make specific requests to FEMA agency officials said .
And in the confusion after the earthquake the information flow is a little slow coming in from the affected area said Carl Suchocki a FEMA spokesman .
Still some aid is moving westward from Washington almost immediately .
HUD officials said they will make available as many as 100 Bay area houses that are under HUD loans but now are vacant after the houses have been inspected to ensure they are sound .
Additional housing vouchers and certificates will be made available officials said and some housing and community-development funds may be shifted from other programs or made available for emergency use .
Another federal agency not normally associated with disaster relief the Internal Revenue Service moved quickly as well .
The IRS said it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake 's devastation .
The agency plans to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days .
And the Treasury said residents of the San Francisco area will be able to cash in savings bonds even if they have n't held them for the minimum six-month period .
One advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the San Francisco Bay area facilities that provide a ready base of supplies and workers .
Even before the full extent of the devastation was known Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the Pentagon and prepare to respond to various FEMA requests for assistance .
By yesterday afternoon Air Force transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies physicians communications equipment and FEMA personnel to California .
A military jet flew a congressional delegation and senior Bush administration officials to survey the damage .
And the Pentagon said dozens of additional crews and transport aircraft were on alert awaiting orders to move emergency supplies .
Two Air Force facilities near Sacramento and Travis Air Force Base 50 miles northeast of San Francisco were designated to serve as medical-airlift centers .
Some victims also were treated at the Letterman Army Medical Center in San Francisco and at the Naval Hospital in Oakland .
In addition 20 military police from the Presidio a military base in San Francisco are assisting with traffic control and a Navy ship was moved from a naval station at Treasure Island near the Bay Bridge to San Francisco to help fight fires .
To help residents in Northern California rebuild FEMA intends to set up 17 disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with 400
