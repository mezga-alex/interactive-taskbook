Confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp dive if trade figures for September due for release tomorrow fail to show a substantial improvement from July and August 's near-record deficits 
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past week 
But analysts reckon underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the chancellor 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his Mansion House speech last Thursday
This has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to 16 % from their current 15 % level to defend the pound economists and foreign exchange market analysts say
The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side said Chris Dillow senior U.K. economist at Nomura Research Institute
If there is another bad trade number there could be an awful lot of pressure noted Simon Briscoe U.K. economist for Midland Montagu a unit of Midland Bank PLC
Forecasts for the trade figures range widely but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the 2 billion 3.2 billion deficit in the current account reported for August
The August deficit and the 2.2 billion gap registered in July are topped only by the 2.3 billion deficit of October 1988
Sanjay Joshi European economist at Baring Brothers & Co. said there is no sign that Britain 's manufacturing industry is transforming itself to boost exports
At the same time he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows
