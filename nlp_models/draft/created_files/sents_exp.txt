Confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp dive if trade figures for September due for release tomorrow fail to show a substantial improvement from July and August 's near-record deficits
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past week
But analysts reckon underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the chancellor 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his Mansion House speech last Thursday
This has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to 16 % from their current 15 % level to defend the pound economists and foreign exchange market analysts say
The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side said Chris Dillow senior U.K. economist at Nomura Research Institute
If there is another bad trade number there could be an awful lot of pressure noted Simon Briscoe U.K. economist for Midland Montagu a unit of Midland Bank PLC
Forecasts for the trade figures range widely but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the 2 billion 3.2 billion deficit in the current account reported for August
The August deficit and the 2.2 billion gap registered in July are topped only by the 2.3 billion deficit of October 1988
Sanjay Joshi European economist at Baring Brothers & Co. said there is no sign that Britain 's manufacturing industry is transforming itself to boost exports
At the same time he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows
He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only 1.8 billion in September
However Mr. Dillow said he believes that a reduction in raw material stockbuilding by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports
Combined with at least some rebound in exports after August 's unexpected decline the deficit could narrow to as little as 1.3 billion
Mr. Briscoe who also forecasts a 1.3 billion current account gap warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling the currency wo n't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions
Nevertheless he noted No one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position in the pound
Meanwhile overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded
In his Mansion House speech Mr. Lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect
U.K. base rates are at their highest level in eight years
But consumer expenditure data released Friday do n't suggest that the U.K. economy is slowing that quickly
The figures show that spending rose 0.1 % in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8 % from a year ago
This compares with a 1.6 % rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5.4 % increase from the second quarter of 1988
Mr. Dillow said the data show the economy is still quite strong but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises
Certainly the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further
Thursday he reminded his audience that the government can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness
Analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than Mr. Lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary
And they warn any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow
Sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in Mr. Lawson 's promise Friday
In European trading it declined to 1.5890 and 2.9495 marks from 1.5940 and 2.9429 marks late Thursday
Economists suggested that if the pound falls much below 2.90 marks the government will be forced to increase rates to 16 % both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged
Friday 's Market Activity The dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated

Freight rates declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation are bottoming out turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation
Trucking shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases scheduled for this fall or early next year reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport
Major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years
That 's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad
Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation and rates are starting to move up at a rate close to or slightly more than the inflation rate said Clifford Sayre director of logistics at Du Pont Co
Shippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University said they expect their freight-transport storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % this year
Only 10 % of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease compared with 30 % who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years
This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates said Bernard LaLonde a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus
The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation
Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill
Shippers cut about 35 billion from their annual inter-city truck and rail costs to about 150 billion or about 6.4 % of gross national product down from 8 % of GNP in 1981
But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates
Shippers are saying the party 's over said Mr. LaLonde
Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years
Transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy
Robert Delaney a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc. Cambridge Mass. said We 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions
Now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor
You 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously
Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers
There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck said Gerard McCullough lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Less-than-truckload companies which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer discounted away a 4.7 % rate increase implemented last April
The carriers were competing fiercely for market share
Railroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks
An official at Consolidated Freightways Inc. a Menlo Park Calif. less-than-truckload carrier said rate discounting in that industry has begun to stabilize
Consolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year and at least two competitors have announced similar increases
Truckers are trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting forget about market share and go for higher rates said Michael Lloyd an analyst at Salomon Bros
And shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can he said
Air-freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month
And Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its rates a further 25 % over the next two years
Such rate increases will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports said Richard Connors a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan
Ship companies carrying bulk commodities such as oil grain coal and iron ore have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years
Some bulk shipping rates have increased 3 % to 4 % in the past few months said Salomon 's Mr. Lloyd
And ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates
Carriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels
Ship lines operating in the Pacific plan to raise rates on containers carrying U.S. exports to Asia about 10 % effective next April

Bob Stone stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination
Mr. Stone thought the discipline was unfair he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons
Unable to persuade the manager to change his decision he went to a company court for a hearing
At the scheduled time Mr. Stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked
After the three members of the court introduced themselves the chairman of the panel said Go ahead and tell us what happened
We may ask questions as you go along or we may wait until the end
No lawyers or tape recorders were present
The only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists one of whom knew Mr. Stone 's case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture
Over a cup of coffee Mr. Stone told his story
He talked about 20 minutes
